    "[tutorial-1](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/tree/master/contrib/python-bindings/notebooks/tutorial-1.ipynb) shows how to create a **Triangulation** using the python binding. We also show how to refine the grid, merge two **Triangulations**, and finally how to output the **Triangulation** so that it can be loaded in a C++ code.\n",
