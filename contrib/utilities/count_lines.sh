#
# This is a little script that can be used to count the lines of source
# code in both the regular source/include/example files as well as the
# tests directories. This is occasionally useful to assess the growth
# of the library over time using a crude metric of its size.
#
# The script assumes that it is called in the top-level directory
# of a deal.II git repository. It counts the number of code lines
# for every 20th commit going back from the current 'master' branch
# to the beginning of the repository history.
#
# It takes, on average, about 1/5th of a second to count lines for one
# commit, averaged over the lifetime of the deal.II project. At the time
# when this script was written, the repository had about 41,000 commits,
# so counting lines for every 20th commit takes approximately 400 seconds,
# or 6m30s.
#
# NOTE: The script has existed in this repository only for a finite time.
#       So, if you go back in history, as this script does, it will
#       eventually disappear. As a consequence, you cannot execute it
#       in its current place -- copy it to the top level of the working
#       copy you are working in, where it will be an untracked file that
#       git leaves alone as it cycles through repository commits.
#
# NOTE: Separately, since the script requires git to check out many
#       different versions, all of which have files that may not exist
#       in the current tip of the git repository you have on your hard
#       drive, or have files that have changed over time, it is going
#       to lead to certain heartbreak if you run this script in a directory
#       that has anything other than a pristine clone of the current git
#       repository. Do not run it in directory in which you do or have
#       done development work.
#
# The output of this file consists of three numbers per line, showing
#   date source-lines test-lines
# displaying the number of lines of code in .h and .cc files, but excluding
# files in contributed libraries. The resulting output can be piped into a data
# file and then be visualized by importing into a spreadsheet, or using the
# following GNUPLOT script:
#
#  set xdata time
#  set timefmt "%Y-%m-%d"
#  set xrange ["1997-11-01":"2021-12-31"]
#  set yrange [0:1000000]
