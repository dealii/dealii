# This is a script that is used by the continuous integration servers
# to make sure that the currently checked out version of a git repository
# satisfies our indentation standards.
#
# It does so by running the 'indent' script (located in the current
# directory), calling 'git diff' to show what differences exist between
# the correctly indented code and what is in the git index (which is
# typically what is in the last commit), and then running a command
# that either returns success or failure, depending on whether or not
# there are differences. The continuous integration services return
# a failure code for a pull request if this script returns a failure.
