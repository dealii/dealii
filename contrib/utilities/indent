#
# This script does the same thing as contrib/utilities/indent-all but only
# reformats files which have changed (or have been added but neither
# staged/committed) since the last merge commit to the master branch.
#
# The script needs to be executed as
#   ./contrib/utilities/indent
# from the top-level directory of the source tree, or via
#   make indent
# from a build directory.
#
# The script can be invoked with DEAL_II_CLANG_FORMAT to change
# the default version of clang-format. For example:
#   DEAL_II_CLANG_FORMAT=clang-format-6.0 ./contrib/utilities/indent
# or,
#   make DEAL_II_CLANG_FORMAT="clang-format-6.0" indent
#
# Note: If the script is invoked with REPORT_ONLY=true set,
#   REPORT_ONLY=true ./contrib/utilities/indent
# or,
#   make REPORT_ONLY=true indent
# then indentation errors will only be reported without any actual file
# changes.
