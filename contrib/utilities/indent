#
# This script indents all source files of deal.II according to our usual
# code formatting standards. It is used to ensure that our code base looks
# uniform, as uniformity helps make code easier to read.
#
# While we're already touching every file, this script also makes
# sure we set permissions correctly and checks for correct unix-style line
# endings.
#
# The script needs to be executed as
#   $ ./contrib/utilities/indent
# from the top-level directory of the source tree, or via
#   $ make indent
# from a build directory.
#
# Note: If the script is invoked with REPORT_ONLY=true set,
#   $ REPORT_ONLY=true ./contrib/utilities/indent
# or,
#   $ make REPORT_ONLY=true indent
# then indentation errors will only be reported without any actual file
# changes.
