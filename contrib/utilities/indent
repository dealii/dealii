# Collect all header and source files and process them in batches of 50
# files with up to 10 in parallel
#
# The command line is a bit complicated, so let's discuss the more
# complicated arguments:
# - For 'find', -print0 makes sure that file names are separated by \0
#   characters, as opposed to the default \n. That's because, surprisingly,
#   \n is a valid character in a file name, whereas \0 is not -- so it
#   serves as a good candidate to separate individual file names.
# - For 'xargs', -0 does the opposite: it separates filenames that are
#   delimited by \0
# - -n 50 calls the following script with up to 50 file names at a time
# - -P 10 calls the following script up to 10 times in parallel

# Format .inst.in files. We need to replace \{ and \} by a sentinel because
# clang-format happily strips away the backslash. Further, there is a minor
# caveat: clang-format automatically renames a comment after a closing
# bracket for a namespace to "} // namespace FooBar". Thus use "namespace"
# as keyword:
#

format_inst()

    f=$1

#
# Now do the formatting. The arguments are as discussed above, plus the
# following:
# - '-n 1' implies that the following script is called for each file
#  individually
# - '-I {}' tells 'xargs' to substitute '{}' in the following by the
#   one file name we process at a time
# - 'bash -c' executes the command that follows. Here, this is
#   'format_inst "$@"' where 'format_inst' is the macro exported
#   above, and '$@' expands to the list of arguments passed on the
#   command line, starting at $1. Because we execute a command with
#   -c, there is no $0 for this bash invokation, and if we just had
#   {} following the argument of -c, then the first element of that
#   list would be ignored. To avoid this, we need a dummy argument
#   to take the role of $0 so that {} can be expanded into $1. We
#   simply use '_' here, but any other string would do fine as well.
