"""A script that locates double word typos, e.g., from tria.h:

    This way it it possible to obtain neighbors across a periodic

This script should be run as

   python double_word_typos.py /path/to/header.h

or, in a loop, e.g.,

    for FILE in $(find ./examples/ -name "*.dox")
    do
        python ./contrib/utilities/double_word_typos.py $FILE
    done

and will print lines containing double words (or double lines, if the first word
of the next line matches the last word of the previous line) to the screen.

The output format used by this script is similar to GCC's and it can be run very
conveniently from inside emacs' compilation-mode.
