#
# This script indents all source files of deal.II according to our usual
# code formatting standards. It is used to ensure that our code base looks
# uniform, as uniformity helps make code easier to read.
#
# While we're already touching every file, this script also makes
# sure we set permissions correctly and checks for correct unix-style line
# endings.
#
# The script needs to be executed as
#   ./contrib/utilities/indent-all
# from the top-level directory of the source tree, or via
#   make indent-all
# from a build directory.
#
# The script can be invoked with DEAL_II_CLANG_FORMAT to change
# the default version of clang-format. For example:
#   DEAL_II_CLANG_FORMAT=clang-format-6.0 ./contrib/utilities/indent
# or,
#   make DEAL_II_CLANG_FORMAT="clang-format-6.0" indent
#
# Note: If the script is invoked with REPORT_ONLY=true set,
#   REPORT_ONLY=true ./contrib/utilities/indent-all
# or,
#   make REPORT_ONLY=true indent-all
# then indentation errors will only be reported without any actual file
# changes.
