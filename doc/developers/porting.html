    <h1>Porting <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to new systems</h1>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses very few
      <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">POSIX</a> specific system
      features and is otherwise fairly ISO (2011) C++ Standard compliant.

      Consequently, there is a good chance that <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      will run on a reasonably well behaved system besides the ones listed
      in the <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a>. Nevertheless,
      there are cases where some adjustments are necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>Unknown compiler</h2>

    <p>
      Currently, the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> CMake build system
      recognizes
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>,
      <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>, as well as
      <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers">icc</a>, and
      sets up reasonable default compiler flags.
      <ul>
        <li>
          To start porting to an unknown compiler, specify
          <code>-DDEAL_II_SETUP_DEFAULT_COMPILER_FLAGS=OFF</code> and set all
          necessary compiler flags by hand via
<pre>
DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS         - used during all builds
DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG   - additional flags for the debug library
DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE - additional flags for the release library
</pre>
          After that try to compile the library with minimal external
          dependencies (<code>-DDEAL_II_ALLOW_AUTODETECTION=OFF</code>, for
          further information see the <a href="../users/cmake_dealii.html">deal.II CMake
            documentation</a>).
        <li>
          For adding permanent support for the unknown compiler to the
          build system, have a look at
<pre>
cmake/setup_compiler_flags.cmake
cmake/setup_compiler_flags_gnu.cmake
cmake/setup_compiler_flags_icc.cmake
</pre>
          Patches are highly welcome! See <a href="http://www.dealii.org/participate.html">here</a>
          for information on how to get in contact with us.
        <li>
          You might want to have a look at
<pre>
cmake/checks/check_01_for_compiler_features.cmake
cmake/checks/check_01_for_cxx_features.cmake
cmake/checks/check_03_for_compiler_bugs.cmake
include/deal.II/base/config.h.in
</pre>
          to see how compiler specific checks are done.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Porting to a new platform</h2>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> should support almost all reasonably
      <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">POSIX</a> compliant
      platforms out of the box. Nevertheless, the following bits of
      information might help:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The build system of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses <a
          href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_top">CMake</a>.  So,
          in order to port <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to a new platform,
          it is obviously necessary that <a href="http://www.cmake.org/"
          target="_top">CMake</a> supports the platform in question
          with at least one generator for a native build tool, see <a
          href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html">here</a>.
        <li>
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is mainly developed with <a
          href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> on GNU/Linux, so it is
          best to begin porting to a new platform with the help of <a
          href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>.
          After that a platform specific compiler might be tried.
        <li>
          Almost all <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">POSIX</a>
          specific code is well guarded with fall-back code in case the
          specific POSIX function is not available. There is (currently)
          one exception, though: Routines that measure elapsed CPU time in
          <code>source/base/timer.cc</code> have implementations for POSIX
          and Windows and will not work correctly on other platforms.
        <li>
          Have a look at
<pre>
cmake/checks/check_01_cxx_features.cmake
cmake/checks/check_02_compiler_features.cmake
cmake/checks/check_02_system_features.cmake
cmake/checks/check_03_compiler_bugs.cmake
include/deal.II/base/config.h.in
</pre>
          to see how platform and compiler specific checks are done.
	<li>
          Of course, we would be happy to hear about the changes you made
          for your system, so that we can include them into the next version
          of the library!
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Cross compiling</h2>

    <p>
      It is possible to use the
      <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html">CMake toolchain</a>
      to cross compile deal.II for a platform other than the one on which the
      compiler is running. The target platform can have a different operating
      system, different architecture or different set of libraries. Cross
      compilation is a very useful technique, for instance it can be used to
      compile deal.II with a compiler that is not available in the target
      machine. An alternative technique is to use a
      <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker container</a> or a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization">virtual machine</a>
      that mimics the target machine.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use any compiler for cross compilation, although
      <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">LLVM/clang</a> might be more versatile
      because it supports multiple architecture targets in a single
      executable natively (see
      <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html">Cross-compilation using Clang</a>).
      Below you can find an example toolchain file for cross compilation with
      clang (and another example for
      <a href="Toolchain-x86_64-w64-mingw32.sample">Windows64 using MinGW</a>).
<pre>
set(target_root /path/to/sysroot)
set(dealii_dir ${target_root}/path/to/lib/dealii)

set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR x86_64)

set(CMAKE_SYSROOT ${target_root})

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER clang)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER clang++)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN ${target_root}/path/to/gcc/toolchain)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN ${target_root}/path/to/gcc/toolchain)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)
</pre>
      If you use LLVM/clang you can use the gcc toolchain of the
      target with the option <code>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN</code>,
      this is equivalent to the clang option
      <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangCommandLineReference.html">--gcc-toolchain</a>.
      You should place all the relevant libraries of the target in
      <code>$target_root</code>. <code>ldd</code> is a great tool figure out the
      libraries that you need. You can use the C libraries of the target such as
      Blas, HDF5 and MPI. On the other hand C++ libraries can be problematic
      because different C++ compilers (or even different versions of the same
      compiler, or the same compiler on different platforms) mangle public
      symbols in radically different ways. For this reason C++ libraries such
      as Trilinos should be cross compiled by the same compiler as deal.II.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the host and the target have a different architecture, you have to set
      up a native deal.II build directory first and run
      <code>make expand_instantiations_exe</code> in it. The executable is
      needed for the build system (the cross compiled version cannot be used if
      the architecture of the target and the host are not the same). Locate the
      <code>expand_instantiations</code> executable (it usually resides under
      <code>${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin</code>) and export its location with the
      <code>PATH</code> environment variable. Below you can find a minimal cmake
      script for the configuration of deal.II.
<pre>
mkdir $dealii_build
cd $dealii_build
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$target_root/lib/directories
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain.cmake \
        -DDEAL_II_FORCE_BUNDLED_BOOST=ON \
        -DDEAL_II_ALLOW_AUTODETECTION=OFF \
        -DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON \
        -DMPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH:STRING=$target_root'/path/to/mpi/include' \
        -DMPI_CXX_LIBRARIES:STRING=$target_root'/path/to/mpi/lib/libmpi_1.so;'$target_root'/path/to/mpi/lib/libmpi_2.so' \
        -DDEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS=ON \
        -DTRILINOS_DIR=$target_root/path/to/trilinos \
        -DDEAL_II_WITH_P4EST=ON \
        -DP4EST_DIR=$target_root/path/to/p4est \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$target_root/path/to/dealii \
        /path/to/dealii/repository
make expand_instantiations_exe
export PATH=$dealii_build/bin/:$PATH
make -jN install
</pre>
      If the target uses <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to set up some libraries,
      you may need to export <code>LD_PRELOAD_PATH</code> with those libraries
      before you call CMake. Note that CMake might not be able to guess the MPI
      configuration, therefore you may have to give all the MPI flags to CMake.
      There are two ways to obtain the MPI flags, you can compile another
      program at the target and then inspect <code>CMakeCache.txt</code>
      or you can obtain the flags using <code>mpic++ --showme:compile</code> and
      <code>mpic++ --showme:link</code>. The remaining configuration can be
      adjusted at will, see <a href="../users/cmake_dealii.html">the documentation</a>. Note
      that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath">rpaths</a> of the
      examples might not be correct, this can be fixed using
      <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or <code>chrpath</code>.
