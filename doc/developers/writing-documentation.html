    <h1>Writing Documentation</h1>

    <p>
    It is our firm belief that software can only be successful if it
    is properly documented. Too many academic software projects die
    prematurely once their creators leave the university or the
    workgroup in which the software was developed, since with their
    creators also knowledge of internal structures, interfaces, and
    the valuable bag of tricks leaves, a gap that can not be closed by
    reading sources, trial-and-error, and guessing.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> project has therefore from its
    infancy adopted a policy that every aspect of the interface
    needs to be well-documented before its inclusion into the
    source tree. Since we have found that it is impossible to keep
    documentation up-to-date if it is not written directly into the
    program code, we write the documentation directly at the place of
    declaration of a function or class and use automatic tools to
    extract this information from the files and process it into HTML
    for our web-pages, or LaTeX for printing.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to the API documentation, we maintain a series of
    <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html" target="_top">
    well-documented example programs</a>, which also follow a certain
    ``literate programming'' style in that the explanations of what
    is happening are integrated into the program source by means of
    comments, and are extracted by small scripts.
    </p>

    <p>
    This document first explains the basics of
    <a href="#API" target="body">documenting the API</a> and then of
    <a href="#examples" target="body">writing example programs</a>.
    </p>


    <a name="API"></a>
    <h2>Writing API documentation</h2>

    <p>
    In order to extract documentation from the header files of the
    project, we use
    <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a>.
    It requires that documentation is written in a form which
    closely follows the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/javadoc/index.html" target="_top">
    JavaDoc</a> standard.
    </p>


    <h3>Basic layout of documentation</h3>

    <p>
    Basically, every declaration, whether class or member
    function/variable declaration, global function or namespace, may
    be preceded by a comment of the following form:
    </p>
<pre>
/**
 * This is an example documentation.
 *
 * @author Wolfgang Bangerth, 2000
 */
class TestClass
{
  public:
           /**
            * Constructor
            */
    TestClass ();

           /**
            * Example function
            */
    virtual void test () const = 0;

           /**
            * Member variable
            */
    const unsigned int abc;
};
</pre>
    <p>
    <acronym>doxygen</acronym> will then generate a page for the class
    <code>TestClass</code> and document each of the member functions
    and variables. The content of the <code>@author</code> tag will be
    included into the online documentation of the class.
    </p>


    <h3>Extended Layout</h3>

    <p>
    In order to allow better structured output for long comments,
    doxygen supports a great number of tags for enumerations,
    sectioning, markup, and other fields. We encourage you to take a
    look at the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/"
    target="_top">doxygen webpage</a> to get an overview. However,
    here is a brief summary of the most often used features:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li> <em>Virtual functions:</em>
        Do not document virtual functions in derived classes, if there
        is nothing different from the base class. If a virtual
        function is documented in a base class, doxygen will
        automatically copy this documentation to the derived
        classes. This mechanism is interrupted, if a documentation
        block is found in the derived class.

    <li> <em>Itemized lists:</em>
         By writing comments like the following,
<pre>
/**
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt; foo
 *   &lt;li&gt; bar
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 */
</pre>
         you can get itemized lists both in the online and printed
         documentation:
         <ul>
         <li> foo
         <li> bar
         </ul>

         <p>
         In other words, one can use standard HTML tags for this
         task. Likewise, you can get numbered lists by using the
         respective HTML tags <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>.
         </p>

    <li> <em>Verbatim output:</em>
         <p>
         If you write comments like this,
         </p>
<pre>
/**
 * @verbatim
 *   void foobar ()
 *   {
 *     i = 0;
 *   }
 * @endverbatim
 */
</pre>
         you will get the lines between the verbatim environment with
         the same formatting and in typewriter font:
<pre>
void foobar ()
{
  i = 0;
}
</pre>
         This is useful if you want to include small sample code snippets
         into your documentation. In particular, it is important that
         the formatting is preserved, which is not the case for all
         other text.

    <li> <em>Typewriter font:</em>
         <p>In order to use typewriter font for instance for function
         arguments or variables, use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> HTML
         tag. For a single word, you can also use the form <code>@p
         one_word_without_spaces</code>. The <code>&lt;tt&gt;</code> is obsolete in HTML5</p>

         <p>
         If you refer to member variables and member functions
         <acronym>doxygen</acronym> has better options than this: use
         <tt>function_name()</tt> to reference member functions and
         <tt>#variable_name</tt> for member variables to create links
         automatically. Refer to the documentation of <a
         href="http:www.doxygen.org"><acronym>doxygen</acronym></a> to
         get even more options for global variables.
         </p>

    <li> <em>Emphasis:</em>
         <p>
         To generate output in italics, use the <code>@em
         one_word_without_spaces</code> tag or the <tt>&lt;em&gt;</tt>
         HTML tag. To generate boldface, use <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt>
         </p>

    <li> <em>Formul&aelig;:</em>
         <p>
         For simple and short formul&aelig; use the <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt>
         HTML tag. Note that you can use <tt>&lt;sub&gt;</tt> and
         <tt>&lt;sup&gt;</tt> to get subscripts an superscripts,
         respectively. Only for longer formul&aelig; use
         <tt>$formula$</tt> to generate a LaTeX formula which will then be
         included as a graphical image.
         </p>

    <li> <em>Sections:</em>
         <p>
         Sections in class and function documentations can be
         generated using the <tt>&lt;hN&gt;</tt> HTML headline
         tags. Headlines inside class documentation should start at
         level 3 (<tt>&lt;h3&gt;</tt>) to stay consistent with the
         structure of the <acronym>doxygen</acronym> output.
         </p>

         <p>
         Sections cannot be referenced, unless you add a <tt>&lt;A
         NAME="..."&gt;</tt> name anchor to them. If you really have
         to do this, please make sure the name does not interfere with
         <acronym>doxygen</acronym> generated anchors.
         </p>

    <li> <em>Exclusion from documentation:</em>
         <p> <acronym>doxygen</acronym> sometimes has problems with inlined
         functions of template classes. For these cases (and other cases of
         parts of the code to be excluded from documentation), we define a
         preprocessor symbol <tt>DOXYGEN</tt> when running
         <acronym>doxygen</acronym>. Therefore, the following template can be
         used to avoid documentation:</p>
<pre>
/* documented code here */

#ifndef DOXYGEN

/* code here is compiled, but ignored by doxygen */

#endif // DOXYGEN
</pre>
    </ul>

    <h3>Code examples for the usage of single classes</h3>
    <p>
    Writing example files for classes is supported by
    <acronym>doxygen</acronym>. These example files go into
    <tt>deal.II/examples/doxygen</tt>. If they are short,
    documentation should be inside and they are included into the
    documentation with <code>@include filename</code>. Take a look how
    the class <code>BlockMatrixArray</code> does this.
    </p>

    <p>
    Larger example files should be documented using the
    <acronym>doxygen</acronym> command <code>@dotinclude</code> and
    related commands. However, if these programs do something
    reasonable and do not only demonstrate a single topic, you should
    consider converting them to a complete example program in the
    <code>step-XX</code> series.
    </p>



    <a name="examples"></a>
    <h2>Writing example programs for the tutorial</h2>

    <p>
    Tutorial programs consist of an introduction, a well documented
    code, and a section that shows the output and numerical results
    of running the program. These three parts are written in separate
    files: for the <code>step-xx</code> program, for example, they
    would be in the
    files <code>examples/doc/step-xx/doc/intro.dox</code>,
    <code>examples/doc/step-xx/step-xx.cc</code> and
    <code>examples/doc/step-xx/doc/results.dox</code>. There are a
    number of scripts that then process and concatenate these three
    different files and send them through doxygen for generation of
    HTML output. In general, if you want to see how certain markup
    features can be used, it is worthwhile looking at the existing
    tutorial program pages and the files they are generated from.
    </p>

    <h3>The introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The introduction, as well as the results section, will be
      processed as if they were doxygen comments. In other words, all
      the usual doxygen markup will work in these sections, including
      latex formulas, though the format for the formula environment is
      a bit awkward. Since it takes much longer to run doxygen for all
      of deal.II than to run latex, most of the lengthier
      introductions are just written in latex (with a minimal amount
      of markup) and later converted into doxygen format. One thing to
      be aware of is that you can reference formulas in doxygen, so
      you have to work around that using text rather than formula
      numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      More important is what goes into the introduction. Typically,
      this would first be a statement of the problem that we want to
      solve. Take a look, for example, at
      the <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_22.html"
      target="_top">step-22</a>
      or <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_31.html"
      target="_top">step-31</a> tutorial programs. Then come a few
      sections in which we would discuss in mathematical terms the
      algorithms that we want to use; this could, for example, include
      the time stepping, discretization, or solver
      approaches. <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_22.html"
      target="_top">step-22</a>
      and <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_31.html"
      target="_top">step-31</a> are again good, if lengthy, examples
      for this.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if a program is an extension of a previous
      program, these things need not be repeated: you would just
      reference the previous program. For
      example, <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_16.html"
      target="_top">step-16</a> does not talk about adaptive meshes
      any more &mdash; it
      extends <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_6.html"
      target="_top">step-6</a> and simply refers there for
      details. Likewise, <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_32.html"
      target="_top">step-32</a> simply refers
      to <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_31.html"
      target="_top">step-31</a> for the problem statement and basic
      algorithm and simply focuses on those parts that are new
      compared to
      <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_31.html" target="_top">step-31</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of the introduction is to explain what the program
      is doing. It should set the mindset so that when you read
      through the code you already know <i>why</i> we are doing
      something. You may not yet know <i>how</i> this done, but this
      is what the documentation within the code is doing. At least you
      don't have to wonder any more why we are building up this
      complicated preconditioner &mdash; we've already discussed this
      in the introduction.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it helps the understanding, the introduction can refer to
      particular pieces of code (but doesn't have to). For example,
      the introduction to <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_20.html"
      target="_top">step-20</a> has pretty lengthy code snippets that
      explain how to implement a general interface of operators that
      may or may not be matrices. This would be awkward to do within
      the code since in the code the view is somewhat smaller (you
      have to have complete parameter lists, follow the syntax of the
      programming language, etc, all of which obscures the things one
      wants to discuss when giving a broad overview related to
      particular C++ constructs). On the other hand, showing code
      snippets in the introduction risks duplicating code in two
      places, which will eventually get out of synch. Consequently,
      this intrstrument should only be used sparingly.
    </p>


    <h3>The actual code</h3>
    <p>
      At present, the tools that extract information from the actual example
      programs code are rather dumb. They are, to be precise, three Perl
      scripts located in the directory of the
      <code>deal.II/doc/doxygen/tutorial</code> tree, where
      the <code>.cc</code> files of the tutorial programs are converted
      into doxygen input files. In essence, what these scripts do is to
      create doxygen input that contains the comments of the program as
      text, and the actual code of the programs as code snippets. You
      can see this when you look at the pages for each of the tutorials
      where the code is indendet relative to the text.
    </p>

    <p>
      The whole thing being interpreted by doxygen means that you can
      put anything doxygen understands into comments. This includes,
      for example references to classes or members in the library (in
      fact, you just need to write their name out and doxygen will
      automatically link them), formulas, lists, etc. It all will come
      out as if you had written comments for doxygen in the first
      place.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bigger question is <i>how</i> to write the comments that
      explain what's going on in individual code blocks. Many years
      back we wrote them so that every line or every two lines had
      their own comment. You can still see this in some of the older
      tutorial programs, though many of them have in the meantime been
      converted to a newer style: it turns out that if you have
      comments so frequently, it becomes hard to follow the flow of an
      algorithm. In essence, you know exactly what each line does, but
      you can't get an overview of what the function as a whole
      does. But that's exactly the point of the tutorial programs, of
      course!
    </p>

    <p>
      So the way we now believe tutorial programs should be written is
      to have comments for each logical block. For example,
      the <code>solve()</code> function in many of the programs is
      relatively straightforward and has at most a dozen lines of
      code. So put a comment in front of the function that explains
      all the things that are going on in the function, and then show
      the function without comments in it &mdash; this way, a reader
      will read through the half or full page of documentation
      understanding the big picture, and can then see the whole
      function all at once on a single screen without having to scroll
      up and down. In the old way, the code would be spread out over a
      couple pages, with comments between almost any two lines, making
      it hard to see how it all fits together.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is somewhat subjective how much code you should leave in each
      block that you document separately. It might be a single line if
      something really important and difficult happens there, but most
      of the time it's probably more along the lines of 6 to 12 lines
      &mdash; a small enough part of the code so that it's easy enough
      to grasp by looking at it all at once, but large enough that it
      contributes a significant part or all of an algorithm.
    </p>


    <h3>The results section</h3>

    <p>
      The results section should show (some of) the output of a
      program, such as the console output and/or a visualization of
      graphical output. It should also contain a brief discussion of
      this output. It is intended to demonstrate what the program
      does, so that a reader can see what happens if the program were
      executed without actually running it. It helps to show a few
      nice graphics there.
    </p>

    <p>
      This section needs not be overly comprehensive. If the program
      is the implementation of a method that's discussed in an
      accompanying paper, it's entirely ok to say "for further
      numerical results, see ...".
    </p>

    <p>
      Like the introduction, the results section file is copied
      verbatim into input for doxygen, so all doxygen markup is
      possible there.
    </p>
