<h1>Information for Developers</h1>

<br />
This page provides documentation for deal.II developers. At present, we
have the following resources available:
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>

<li> <p>
     <a href="cmake-internals.html">Build system internals</a>:
     This page provides implementation and development details about
     the CMake build system.

<li> <p><a href="writing-documentation.html" target="body">Writing
     documentation</a>: To document the library and our
     application programs, we use
     <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a>.
     This page documents the basics of the format in
     which the documentation needs to be written in order to
     enable automatic documentation generation.
     </p>

<li> <p><a href="porting.html" target="body">Porting
     <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to a new system</a>:

     <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses CMake as build system and is fairly
     ISO (1998) C++ Standard compliant. So, porting to a reasonably <a
     href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/" target="_top">POSIX</a>
     compliant system with a reasonably ISO C++ compliant compiler shouldn't
     be much work. Other (mostly proprietary) systems might require more
     work. See the <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a> file for
     more information on already supported systems. This resource gives some
     hints for porting to unknown platforms.
     </p>

<li> <p><a href="../doxygen/deal.II/CodingConventions.html"
     target="body">Coding conventions</a>: We try to adhere to a
     set of coding conventions to ensure that the use of different
     parts of the library is as uniform as possible. Please read
     through them if you think about contributing code.

<li> <p><a href="testsuite.html" target="body">Running the testsuite</a>:
     <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has a testsuite that we run to
     make sure that our tests don't break any existing
     functionality. This page explains its use.
