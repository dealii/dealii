    <h1>Documentation of the deal.II SVN Archive</h1>

    <h2>The global structure</h2>


    The root of the deal.II archive is located
    at <a href="https://svn.dealii.org/">https://svn.dealii.org/</a>.
    There are three subdirectories:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://svn.dealii.org/trunk/">trunk</a>:
	This is the location of the current development version; it contains the
	directories <a href="https://svn.dealii.org/trunk/deal.II">deal.II</a>
	with the library proper
	and <a href="https://svn.dealii.org/trunk/tests">tests</a>
	with the testsuite.

      <li> <a href="https://svn.dealii.org/tags/">tags</a>:
	contains released versions. They have the same
	structure as the trunk.

      <li> <a href="https://svn.dealii.org/branches/">branches</a>:
	currently active branches; it also has subdirectories:
	<ul>
	  <li> <a href="https://svn.dealii.org/branches/releases">releases</a>:
	    branches for releases of deal.II
	  <li> <a href="https://svn.dealii.org/branches/retired">retired</a>:
	    development branches that have been merged into the
	    trunk and are no longer used.
	</ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Creating a development branch</h2>

    <p>
      Significant changes in the library often cannot be developed all at once. In a
      case like this, one can create a development branch in the subversion
      repository into which one can check in all necessary changes and from which
      one can merge the final set of changes into the main development line once
      ready. The <tt>svn</tt> program can be used
      to keep your branch up-to-date with the trunk.
    </p>

    <p>
      Creating a branch works through the following steps:

      <ol>
	<li> Create the branch using
<pre>
$ svn copy https://svn.dealii.org/trunk/ https://svn.dealii.org/branches/new-branch-name
</pre>

	<li> Either check out the new branch or switch your working copy by
<pre>
$ svn switch https://svn.dealii.org/branches/new-branch-name
</pre>
	  This command assumes you are in the top level directory, the one
	  containing <tt>deal.II</tt> and <tt>tests</tt>

	<li> After some development of the branch, if you want to merge changes
	  that have been made on mainline in the meantime, you can use this command:
<pre>
$ svn merge ^/trunk
</pre>
	  This command will only run if you have no local changes in your working
	  directory for the branch, and will modify all of your files by merging
	  the changes made on mainline. If there are no conflicts that need to be
	  resolved, you can simply commit the result.
      </ol>
    </p>
