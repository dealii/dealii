<h2> Coding convention </h2>
<p>
  Coding conventions are always a matter of choice. Nevertheless, the
  following rules should be considered:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Statements and keywords are written in all caps.
    <li>
      Indenting is done by two spaces; the usual indenting rules apply.
    <li>
      The <code>ELSE()</code>, <code>ENDIF()</code>,
      <code>ENDFOREACH()</code>, etc. statements shall not repeat the
      corresponding condition in <code>IF()</code>,
      <code>FOREACH()</code>, etc.
    <li>
      To emphasize a comment it may be enclosed by a leading and
      trailing empty comment line.
  </ul>
  An example:
<pre class="cmake">
FOREACH(_build ${DEAL_II_BUILD_TYPES})
#
# Set an appropriate keyword depending on target and build type:
#
  IF(NOT "${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}" STREQUAL "DebugRelease")
    SET(_keyword "general")
  ELSE()
    IF(_build MATCHES DEBUG)
      SET(_keyword "debug")
    ELSE()
      SET(_keyword "optimized")
    ENDIF()
  ENDIF()
ENDFOREACH()
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    Line break is at 78 characters and should be obeyed whenever
    reasonable.
  <li>
    Long statements should be broken into several lines at reasonable
    places. Additional lines for a statement are indented by 2
    spaces.
  <li>
    Multiline statements must end with the closing bracket at a
    single line:
</ul>
<pre class="cmake">
LIST(APPEND CONFIG_LIBRARIES
  ${_keyword}
  ${CONFIG_LIBRARIES_${_build}}
)

SET_TARGET_PROPERTIES(${DEAL_II_BASE_NAME}${DEAL_II_${build}_SUFFIX}
  PROPERTIES
  VERSION ${VERSION}
  SOVERSION ${VERSION}
  LINK_FLAGS "${DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS_${build}}"
  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS "${DEAL_II_DEFINITIONS};${DEAL_II_DEFINITIONS_${build}}"
  COMPILE_FLAGS "${DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_${build}}"
)
</pre>

<p>
  CMake operates almost always with variables in global state. To
  guard against accidental overwrite of variables the following naming
  conventions must be followed at all times:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Global (configuration) variables are written in all caps. When
    introducing a new one, ensure that the name isn't already used
    somewhere else. Unrelated global variables must never be
    overwritten.
  <li>
    Global variables can be prefixed by <code>DEAL_II_</code>.
    (Global variables defined by CMake are usually prefixed by
    <code>CMAKE_</code>.)
  <li>
    Local variables should always be named in all lowercase with a
    leading "_". Local variables cannot be assumed to remain valid.
    The may get overwritten at any time.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<a name="setup"></a>
<h3> <code>./CMakeLists.txt</code> and <code>./cmake/setup_*.cmake</code> </h3>

<p>
  The very first configuration steps after some initial setup in
  <code>./CMakeLists.txt</code> takes place in some
  <code>./cmake/setup_*.cmake</code> files:
  <ul>
    <li> <code>setup_cached_variables.cmake</code>:
      This sets up all cached variables prior to the call to
      <code>PROJECT(deal.II)</code>. For details see the comment at the
      top. Furthermore, some bookkeeping for compiler and linker flags
      takes place, see <a href="../users/cmake.html#configurebuild">the section
        about compile flags</a>.
    <li> <code>setup_deal_ii.cmake</code>:
      This file is included immediately after the call to
      <code>PROJECT(deal.II)</code> and will set up all <i>magic
        numbers</i> such as names, definitions, relative and absolute
      paths used in the build system. Most of the definitions are
      guarded with the help of the <code>SET_IF_EMPTY</code> macro so
      that it is possible to override the values from the command line.
    <li> <code>setup_compiler_flags.cmake</code>
      sets up a suitable set of default compile flag for a known
      compiler by including the appropriate
      <code>setup_compiler_flags_*.cmake</code> file. When adding new
      flags or compiler support, please respect the following note

<pre>
#
# (./cmake/setup_compiler_flags.cmake)
#
# ####################
# #     FAT NOTE:    #
# ####################
#
# All configuration in setup_compiler_flags.cmake and
# setup_compiler_flags_<compiler>.cmake shall ONLY modify:
#
#   DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS
#   DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG
#   DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE
#   DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS
#   DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG
#   DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE
#
# All modifications shall be guarded with the ENABLE_IF_SUPPORTED
# or ENABLE_IF_LINKS macro, e.g.
#
#   ENABLE_IF_SUPPORTED(DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS "-fpic")
#   ENABLE_IF_LINKS(DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS "-Wl,--as-needed")
#
# Compiler flags for platform dependent optimization (such as
# -march=native) must always be guarded with
# DEAL_II_ALLOW_PLATFORM_INTROSPECTION:
#
#   IF(DEAL_II_ALLOW_PLATFORM_INTROSPECTION)
#     ENABLE_IF_SUPPORTED(DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS "-march=native")
#   ENDIF()
#
# Checks for compiler features (such as C++11 support) and compiler
# specific bugs that
#   - usually set up further configuration (such as preprocessor
#     definitions)
#   - disable a specific flag for a specific compiler version.
#
# belong the corresponding file:
#
#   ./cmake/checks/check_01_compiler_features.cmake
#   ./cmake/checks/check_01_cpu_features.cmake
#   ./cmake/checks/check_01_cxx_features.cmake
#   ./cmake/checks/check_01_system_features.cmake
#   ./cmake/checks/check_02_compiler_bugs.cmake
#
</pre>
  </ul>
</p>


<a name="checks"></a>
<h3> <code>./cmake/checks/check_*.cmake</code> </h3>

<p>
  The next step in the configuration process is to include all
  checks residing under <code>./cmake/checks</code>. Currently
  there are:

<pre>
./cmake/checks/check_01_compiler_features.cmake
  - Search for support for compiler dependent features such as stack
    trace support, demangler support, etc.

./cmake/checks/check_01_cpu_features.cmake
  - Platform introspection for CPU features goes here and must be
    guarded with DEAL_II_ALLOW_PLATFORM_INTROSPECTION

./cmake/checks/check_01_cxx_features.cmake
  - Check for supported C++ language features such as sufficient C++11
    support

./cmake/checks/check_01_system_features.cmake
  - Checks for specific platform (Linux/Darwin/CYGWIN/Windows..)
    features and support

./cmake/checks/check_02_compiler_bugs.cmake
  - Check for compiler bugs
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>
    A check usually consists of a call to one of the macros below
    that will set up a global variable. Please stick to the naming
    convention <code>HAVE_&lt;..&gt;</code>, resp.
    <code>DEAL_II_(HAVE|USE)_&lt;..&gt;</code>. <b>It is forbidden to
      use a variable name starting with
      <code>DEAL_II_WITH_&lt;..&gt;</code> because this prefix is
      exclusively reserved for the feature mechanism described
      below.</b> For some tests it might be necessary to manipulate
    <a href="#variables">global variables</a>.
  <li>
    A platform check should have a prominent comment explaining what
    it does and why it is there, and should state author and year.
  <li>
    There are a number of readily available platform check macros:
    
<pre>
CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_COMPILES(source variable)
  - Checks whether it is possible to compile _and_ link the code snippet
    &lt;source&gt;. If successful, variable is set to 1.

CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_RUNS(source variable)
  - variable is set to 1 if &lt;source&gt; could be successfully compiled and
    linked and the resulting program ran and exited without error.
    Avoid this macro outside of a DEAL_II_ALLOW_PLATFORM_INTROSPECTION
    guard. A sensible fallback should be provided if the check cannot
    be run (e.g. when cross compiling).

CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_BUG(source variable)
  - Inverts the logic of CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_COMPILES(), i.e. variable is
    set to 1 if it was not possible to compile and link &lt;source&gt;.

CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX(header variable)
  - Check whether it is possible to compile and link a dummy program
    including &lt;header&gt;.

CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS(function variable)
  - Check for the existence of a function prototype with name
    &lt;function&gt;. (Don't forget to specify the link libraries, see
    below.) Use CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS to search for C++ function
    definitions instead, if possible.

CHECK_CXX_SYMBOL_EXISTS(symbol header_file variable)
  - Check for the existence of a symbol definition in the header_file
    as well as for the presence in the current link interface
    (Don't forget to specify the link libraries, see below.)

CHECK_CXX_COMPILER_FLAG(flag variable)
  - Sets the variable to 1 if the compiler understands the flag.
</pre>

  <li> Necessary compiler flags can easily set in the string variable
    <code>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</code>. There is a small macro that does this
    job nicely:

<pre class="cmake">
PUSH_CMAKE_REQUIRED("-Werror")
CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_COMPILES(...)
RESET_CMAKE_REQUIRED()
</pre>

  <li> Necessary include directories and libraries necessary for
    linkage can be set in the list variables
    <code>CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES</code> and
    <code>CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES</code>. It is best to append these
    lists and later on reset <code>CMAKE_REQUIRED_*</code> (including
    <code>CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS</code>) to their default values:
    
<pre class="cmake">
LIST(APPEND CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES &lt;a list of includes&gt;)
LIST(APPEND CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES &lt;a list of libraries&gt;)
CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_COMPILES(...)
RESET_CMAKE_REQUIRED()
</pre>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="findmodules"></a>
<h3> <code>./cmake/modules/Find*.cmake</code> </h3>

<p>
  These are find modules for the <code>configure_*.cmake</code> files
  and the <code>CONFIGURE_FEATURE</code> macro as will explained later.
  It is crucial that a find module behaves correctly. Therefore, the
  following rules are mandatory:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The <i>sole</i> purpose of a find module is to find an external
      library (no deal.II specific dependency checking, no
      compatibility checking).
    <li>
      It should do so by appropriate <code>DEAL_II_FIND_LIBRARY</code>,
      <code>DEAL_II_FIND_PATH</code> and <code>DEAL_II_FIND_FILE</code>
      calls (same syntax as the native CMake functions; just a small
      wrapper to provide some useful output). The results of this calls
      should be the only cached variables.
    <li>
      A <code>WARNING</code>, <code>SEND_ERROR</code> or
      <code>FATAL_ERROR</code> must be avoided (the only exception is
      the <code>REQUIRED</code> keyword).
    <li>
      The following uncached variables are recognized by the feature
      configuration mechanism:
<pre class="cmake">
FEATURE_FOUND
FEATURE_LIBRARIES (with optimized, debug, release keywords)
FEATURE_LIBRARIES(_DEBUG|_RELEASE)
FEATURE_INCLUDE_DIRS FEATURE_USER_INCLUDE_DIRS
FEATURE_LINKER_FLAGS(|_DEBUG|_RELEASE)
FEATURE_CXX_FLAGS(|_DEBUG|_RELEASE)
FEATURE_DEFINITIONS(|_DEBUG|_RELEASE)
FEATURE_VERSION
FEATURE_VERSION(_MAJOR|_MINOR|_SUBMINOR)
</pre>
      The <code>DEAL_II_PACKAGE_HANDLE</code> macro should be exclusively
      used for setting up these variables (except the version variants). An
      example invocation is
<pre class="cmake">
DEAL_II_PACKAGE_HANDLE(UMFPACK
  LIBRARIES
    REQUIRED UMFPACK_LIBRARY
    OPTIONAL CHOLMOD_LIBRARY CCOLAMD_LIBRARY COLAMD_LIBRARY CAMD_LIBRARY ${_suitesparse_config}
    REQUIRED AMD_LIBRARY
    OPTIONAL METIS_LIBRARIES LAPACK_LIBRARIES rt_LIBRARY
  INCLUDE_DIRS
    REQUIRED UMFPACK_INCLUDE_DIR AMD_INCLUDE_DIR
    OPTIONAL SuiteSparse_config_INCLUDE_DIR
  LINKER_FLAGS
    OPTIONAL LAPACK_LINKER_FLAGS
  CLEAR
    UMFPACK_LIBRARY CHOLMOD_LIBRARY CCOLAMD_LIBRARY COLAMD_LIBRARY
    CAMD_LIBRARY SuiteSparse_config_LIBRARY AMD_LIBRARY UMFPACK_INCLUDE_DIR
    AMD_INCLUDE_DIR SuiteSparse_config_INCLUDE_DIR
  )
</pre>
      The macro concatenates all specified variables into the final
      <code>FEATURE_SUFFIX</code> variable. Hereby, a feature is
      successfully found if all <code>REQUIRED</code> variables are
      non-empty an not set to <code>"-NOTFOUND"</code>.
      <code>OPTIONAL</code> variables are just filtered out in this case.
      As a last set of parameters the full list of cached search result
      variables must be specified after the <code>CLEAR</code> keyword -
      this is used to provide a possibility to undo a feature search.
    <li>
      Only "local" variables "<code>_&lt;all lowercase&gt;</code>" or
      "global" variables prefixed by <code>FEATURE_</code> may be
      altered. Do not set <code>DEAL_II_*</code> or <code>CMAKE_*</code>
      variables directly!
    <li>
      A hint with <code>FEATURE_DIR</code> can be set up for
      convenience. It is best to start the <code>Find</code> module by
<pre class="cmake">
SET(FEATURE_DIR "" CACHE PATH "short description")
SET_IF_EMPTY(FEATURE_DIR "$ENV{FEATURE_DIR}")
</pre>
      and use <code>FEATURE_DIR</code> as a hint.
</ul>


<a name="configure"></a>
<h3> <code>./cmake/configure/configure_*.cmake</code> </h3>

<p>
  The final step in the configuration phase is the setup of features
  (which refer to external or bundled libraries
  <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can optionally interface with.)
</p>

<p>
  At bare minimum <code>configure_&lt;feature&gt;.cmake</code>
  file for a feature just consists of a call to the
  <code>CONFIGURE_FEATURE(&lt;FEATURE&gt;)</code> macro which is
  implemented in
  <code>./cmake/macros/macro_configure_feature.cmake</code>.
  In this case the corresponding <code>Find&lt;FEATURE&gt;.cmake</code>
  module is used to determine whether an external dependency can be
  resolved or not. Depending on the current state of
  <code>DEAL_II_WITH_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</code> (see
  <a href="../users/cmake.html#configurefeature">here</a>) the
  configuration variables
<pre>
FEATURE_LIBRARIES
FEATURE_LIBRARIES(|_DEBUG|_RELEASE)
FEATURE_(|USER_|BUNDLED_)INCLUDE_DIRS
FEATURE_LINKER_FLAGS(|_DEBUG|_RELEASE)
FEATURE_CXX_FLAGS(|_DEBUG|_RELEASE)
FEATURE_DEFINITIONS(|_DEBUG|_RELEASE)
</pre>
  are appended to the set of <a href="#variables">global variables</a>
  and <code>DEAL_II_WITH_&lt;FEATURE&gt;</code> is set to
  <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>

<p>
  It is possible to override this default behaviour with the following
  variables and macros (all of them are optional and will be replaced
  by an appropriate default action if unset):
  <ul>
    <li>
     <code>&lt;FEATURE&gt;</code> means all caps,
     <code>&lt;feature&gt;</code> means all lowercase

    <li>
      In <code>./cmake/configure/configure_&lt;feature&gt;.cmake</code>:
<pre>
FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_DEPENDS              (a variable)
  - a variable which contains an optional list of other features
    this feature depends on (and which have to be enbled for this feature
    to work.)
    Features must be given with short name, i.e. without DEAL_II_WITH_

FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_AFTER                (a variable)
  - a variable which contains an optional list of other features
    that have to be configured prior to this feature
    Features must be given with short name, i.e. without DEAL_II_WITH_

FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_FIND_EXTERNAL(var)   (a macro)
  - which should set var to TRUE if all dependencies for the feature are
    fulfilled. In this case all necessary variables for
    FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_CONFIGURE_EXTERNAL must be set.
    Otherwise var should remain unset.
    If this macro is undefined, FIND_PACKAGE(&lt;FEATURES&gt;) is
    called directly instead.

FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_CONFIGURE_EXTERNAL()  (a macro)
  - which should setup all necessary configuration for the feature with
    external dependencies. If something goes wrong this macro must
    issue a FATAL_ERROR.
    If this macro is undefined, the information provided in
    &lt;FEATURES&gt;_LIBRARIES, &lt;FEATURES&gt;_INCLUDE_DIRS and
    &lt;FEATURES&gt;_LINKER_FLAGS is used for the build.

FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_CONFIGURE_BUNDLED()  (a macro)
  - which should setup all necessary configuration for the feature with
    bundled source dependencies. If something goes wrong this macro must
    issue a FATAL_ERROR.

FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_ERROR_MESSAGE()      (macro)
  - which should print a meaningful error message (with FATAL_ERROR) for
    the case that no external library was found (and bundled is not
    allowed to be used.) If not defined, a suitable default error message
    will be printed.
</pre>

    <li>
      In <code>./bundled/configure_bundled.cmake</code>:
<pre>
FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_HAVE_BUNDLED         (a boolean)
  - which should either be set to TRUE if all necessary libraries of the
    features comes bundled with deal.II and hence can be supported
    without external dependencies, or unset.

DEAL_II_FORCE_BUNDLED_&lt;FEATURE&gt;        (an option)
  - If &lt;feature&gt; can be set up by bundled libraries, this
    configuration option must be present to force a use of bundled
    dependencies
</pre>

    <li>
      Furthermore, if
      <code>FEATURE_&lt;FEATURE&gt;_BUNDLED_CONFIGURED</code> is set to
      <code>TRUE</code> the file <code>./bundled/CMakeLists.txt</code>
      must compile and install the bundled package appropriately.
  </ul>
</p>



<a name="variables"></a>
<h3> Global variables controlling the build process </h3>

<p>
  The following list describes all global variables controlling the
  build process and the visibility associated with it (internal use for
  compiling deal.Ii, externally used variables will get exported in
  deal.IIConfig.cmake). Lists should be manipulated with
  <code>LIST(APPEND ...)</code>, flags with <code>ADD_FLAGS(...)</code>
  (or if it is necessary to guard them with
  <code>ENABLE_IF_SUPPORTED(...)</code>.)
</p>
<p>
  <b>Feature configuration must not be added directly to this variables but
    to corresponding <code>&lt;FEATURE&gt;_*</code> variables, instead.
  Feature configuration variables get appended to the below list of global
  configuration variables automatically.</b>
</p>


  <ul>
    <li>
      The general (internal) logic for variables applies:
      <ul>
        <li>A variable name without <code>_DEBUG</code> or
          <code>_RELEASE</code>: Used for all targets
        <li> <code>&lt;...&gt;_DEBUG</code>: <i>additionally</i> used for debug targets
        <li> <code>&lt;...&gt;_RELEASE</code>: <i>additionally</i> used for release targets
      </ul>

    <li>
      For internal and external use, used to keep track of external
      libraries, the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library and user
      programs have to be linked against:
      <ul>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_LIBRARIES</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_LIBRARIES_DEBUG</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_LIBRARIES_RELEASE</code>
      </ul>

    <li>
      For internal use, for setting necessary include dirs for the compilation of the
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library:
      <ul>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_INCLUDE_DIRS</code>
      </ul>
    <li>
      Used to keep track of external include dirs, necessary for the
      compilation of user programs:
      <ul>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_USER_INCLUDE_DIRS</code>
      </ul>
    <li>
      Include dirs from bundled packages necessary for the compilation fo
      the library and user projects out of the build directory:
      <ul>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_BUNDLED_INCLUDE_DIRS</code>
      </ul>

    <li>
      For internal use, for setting necessary preprocessor definitions
      (<code>-D&lt;...&gt;</code>) for the compilation of the
      deal.II library:
      <ul>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_DEFINITIONS</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_DEFINITIONS_RELEASE</code>
      </ul>
    <li>
      For external use, used to keep track of external preprocessor
      definitions, necessary for the compilation of user programs:
      <ul>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_USER_DEFINITIONS</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_USER_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_USER_DEFINITIONS_RELEASE</code>
      </ul>

    <li>
      For internal and external use, for setting necessary compiler flags,
      e.g. <code>-std=c++11</code> (if available):
      <ul>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE</code>
      </ul>

    <li>
      For internal and external use, for setting necessary linker flags for
      the deal.II library and user programs:
      <ul>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG</code>
        <li> <code>DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS_RELEASE</code>
      </ul>

  </ul>
</p>


<h2>Target definition and installation</h2>
<a name="config.h.in"></a>
<h3> <code>./include/deal.II/base/config.h.in</code> </h3>

In contrast to autoconf there is no intermediate step any more that
automatically generates config.h.in. The setup in this file has to be
done by hand. Please note:
  <ul>
    <li> <code>config.h.in</code> should only contain a minimum of
    necessary compile definitions to avoid unnecessary recompilation if
    configuration changes.
    <li> Definition toggles in <code>config.h.in</code> should have a
      prominent comment explaining it and should be grouped by file
      exporting the definition.
  </ul>


<a name="source"></a>
<h3><code>./source/CMakeLists.txt</code></h3>

<p>
  All parts of the library are organized into logical object libraries
  with their respective sources lying under
  <code>./source/&lt;foo&gt;</code>, or
  <code>./bundled/&lt;foo&gt;/&lt;...&gt;</code>. The actual setup of
  an object library happens within that subdirectories with the help of
  two macros:
<pre class="cmake">
#
# Glob for all header files associated with the object target:
# As this list is only for cosmetic reasons, so that associated header
# files show up in IDEs, we don't manage an explicit list (with the
# trade-off to have to run "make rebuild_cache" when a new header file
# emerges...)
#
FILE(GLOB _header
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/deal.II/dofs/*.h
  )

#
# A list of source files forming the object target:
#
SET(_src
  ...
  dof_tools.cc
  )

#
# A list of instantiations that must be expanded:
#
SET(_inst
  ...
  dof_tools.inst.in
  )

#
# The following macro will set up an obj_dofs.debug and
# obj_dofs.release target  with appropriate compile flags and
# definitions for a simultaneous build of debug and release library.
# Furthermore, the object name will be stored in
#   ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}${CMAKE_FILES_DIRECTORY}/deal_ii_objects_(debug/release)
# so that it is available in global scope.
#
# Header files and instatiation files (${_header}, ${_inst}) are added
# for cosmetic reasons, so that they show up in IDEs.
#
DEAL_II_ADD_LIBRARY(obj_dofs OBJECT ${_src} ${_header} ${_inst})

#
# This macro will set up an obj_dofs.inst target for expanding all
# files listed in ${inst_in_files}. Appropriate target dependencies
# will be added to obj_dofs.debug and obj_dofs.release.
#
EXPAND_INSTANTIATIONS(obj_dofs "${inst_in_files}")

  Later, all object targets are collected in
  <code>./source/CMakeLists.txt</code> to define the actual debug and
  releases libraries. For further details, see
  <code>./source/CMakelists.txt</code> and
  <code>./cmake/macros/macro_deal_ii_add_library.cmake</code>.

<h3><code>./cmake/config/CMakeLists.txt</code></h3>

<p>
  The final bits of configuration happens in
  <code>./cmake/config/CMakeLists.txt</code> where the templates for
  the project configuration <code>deal.IIConfig.cmake</code> and the
  compatibility file <code>Make.global_options</code> get expanded.
  Furthermore, the configuration for the template expansion mechanism
  resides under <code>./cmake/config/template_arguments.in</code>.
