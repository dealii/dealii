    <h1>Interfacing <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to SLEPc</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/"
      target="_top">SLEPc</a> is a software package that provides
      functionality for solving a variety of eigenspectrum problems,
      both standard and generalised. It relies on various different
      sparse and dense matrix and vector formats that are defined in
      the PETSc package.  Naturally, this means PETSc must be
      correctly installed before a working copy of SLEPc can be
      installed as described <a href="petsc.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has wrapper classes to the solver and
      spectral transformation parts of SLEPc that loosely provide
      almost the same interfaces as the wrapper classes to the PETSc
      functionality. They are used in a simple case in step-36.
    </p>

    <h4>Installing <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with SLEPc</h4>

    <p>
      SLEPc requires the environment variables <code>PETSC_DIR</code>
      and <code>PETSC_ARCH</code> to be set already and usually
      requires you to set the environment
      variable <code>SLEPC_DIR</code> as well. If the environment
      variable is set, then
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> will pick up on this during
      configuration; just as before with PETSc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively, the <code>-DSLEPC_DIR=DIR</code> option
      for <code>cmake</code> can be used to override the values
      of <code>SLEPc_DIR</code> if, for example, these environment
      variables are not set at all. You can also
      specify <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_SLEPC=OFF</code> as a flag during
      configuration to have <acronym>deal.II</acronym> completely
      ignore a SLEPc installation.
    </p>

    <h4>Installing SLEPc</h4>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> The version numbers (x,y,z) of your SLEPc
      installation must be identical to the same version numbers of
      your PETSc installation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Installing SLEPc is not much of a challenge once PETSc has been
      correctly installed (check this first!). What is happening here,
      is that SLEPc scans your PETSc installation and figures out how
      that was configured; its location, the
      given <code>PETSC_ARCH</code>, MPI settings, debug
      mode, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      This builds a simple SLEPc installation:
      <pre>

	tar xvzf slepc-x-y-z.tar.gz
        cd slepc-x-y-z
	export SLEPC_DIR=`pwd`
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SLEPC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	./configure
	make
      </pre>
      Now let SLEPc check his own sanity:
      <pre>

	make test
      </pre>
      will self-check the serial (and MPI) implementation of SLEPc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, you may want to put the two <code>export</code>
      commands above into your <code>~/.bashrc</code>
      or <code>~/.cshrc</code> files, with the first one replaced by
      <pre>

	export SLEPC_DIR=/path/to/slepc-x-y-z
      </pre>
      The <code>cmake</code> installation should then be able to pick
      up where you installed SLEPc and include it automatically in the
      deal.II build without any further need for instructions. You
      will see at the bottom of the <code>cmake</code> output if that
      is what actually happened.
    </p>
