    <h1>Installing deal.II with CUDA</h1>

    <p>
      To compile and run CUDA code, you need to use an external Kokkos
      installation that has been configured with CUDA support.
      Note that deal.II requires a compiler that is compatible with the
      backends enabled in Kokkos. In particular, you need to explicitly set `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` to either Kokkos'
      <code>nvcc_wrapper</code> or <code>clang++</code> when enabling the
      Cuda backend.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several MPI implementations are able to perform MPI operations with data
      located in device memory directly without the need to copy to CPU memory
      explicitly first. This feature is commonly known as "CUDA-aware MPI".
      In case deal.II is compiled with MPI support and the MPI implementation
      supports this feature, you can tell deal.II to use it by configuring with
      <pre>

        -DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON
        -DDEAL_II_MPI_WITH_DEVICE_SUPPORT=ON
      </pre>
      Note, that there is no check that detects if the MPI implementation
      really is CUDA-aware. Activating this flag for incompatible MPI libraries
      will lead to segmentation faults in MPI calls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using CUDA in combination with architecture-specific C++ compiler flags
      like <code>-march=native</code> is known to be fragile and there might be
      compatibility issues with other libraries, e.g. using CUDA 10.1 with
      <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_TBB=ON</code> and
      <code>-DDEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS=-march=native</code> results in compile time
      errors like:
      <pre>

        /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/include/avx512fintrin.h(11265): error: identifier "__builtin_ia32_scalefsd_round" is undefined
        /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/include/avx512fintrin.h(11274): error: identifier "__builtin_ia32_scalefss_round" is undefined
      </pre>
      Since vectorization in VectorizedArray is disabled when compiling with
      CUDA support anyway, it is recommended to drop the compile flag in that
      case.
