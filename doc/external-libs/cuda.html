    <h1>Installing deal.II with CUDA</h1>

    <p>
      To compile and run CUDA code, you need to use an external Kokkos
      installation that has been configured with CUDA support.

      To enable deal.II's own CUDA backend, you will need your GPU to have compute
      capability 6.0 or higher. Independently from the GPU itself, you also need a
      version of CUDA between 10.2 and 11.8.
    </p>

    <p>
      To configure deal.II's own CUDA backend use the following option:
      <pre>

        -DDEAL_II_WITH_CUDA=ON
      </pre>
      CUDA versions prior to 11.0 don't support C++17 or higher. You will have
      to make sure that C++17 is disabled when using earlier versions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several MPI implementations are able to perform MPI operations with data
      located in device memory directly without the need to copy to CPU memory
      explicitly first. This feature is commonly known as "CUDA-aware MPI".
      In case deal.II is compiled with MPI support and the MPI implementation
      supports this feature, you can tell deal.II to use it by configuring with
      <pre>

        -DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON
        -DDEAL_II_MPI_WITH_DEVICE_SUPPORT=ON
      </pre>
      Note, that there is no check that detects if the MPI implementation
      really is CUDA-aware. Activating this flag for incompatible MPI libraries
      will lead to segmentation faults in MPI calls.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using CUDA in combination with architecture-specific C++ compiler flags
      like <code>-march=native</code> is known to be fragile and there might be
      compatibility issues with other libraries, e.g. using CUDA 10.1 with
      <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_TBB=ON</code> and
      <code>-DDEAL_II_CXX_FLAGS=-march=native</code> results in compile time
      errors like:
      <pre>

        /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/include/avx512fintrin.h(11265): error: identifier "__builtin_ia32_scalefsd_round" is undefined
        /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/include/avx512fintrin.h(11274): error: identifier "__builtin_ia32_scalefss_round" is undefined
      </pre>
      Since vectorization in VectorizedArray is disabled when compiling with
      CUDA support anyway, it is recommended to drop the compile flag in that
      case.
