    <h1>Interfacing <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to Trilinos</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov" target="_top">Trilinos</a> is a
      software package that provides lots of functionality for linear
      algebra, among other things. For example, it includes implementations of a variety of
      linear solvers, as well as various different sparse and dense matrix and
      vector formats. Trilinos also has many subpackages that deal with
      problems that go far beyond linear algebra, for example nonlinear
      solvers, automatic differentiation packages, uncertainty propagation
      engines, etc. Of particular interest to deal.II is their ability to
      provide this functionality both on sequential and parallel (using MPI)
      computers. Compared to <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/"
				target="_top">PETSc</a>, which is written in C, Trilinos is written in
      C++ and can be
      considered to be a more modern version of PETSc though both packages are
      under continuing development at their respective national laboratories.
    </p>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has wrapper classes to the linear algebra
      parts of Trilinos that provide almost the
      same interfaces as the built-in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> linear
      algebra classes. We use these interfaces for parallel computations based
      on MPI since the native deal.II linear algebra classes lack this
      ability. They are used, among other programs, in step-31 and step-32.
    </p>

    <p>
      While building deal.II with Trilinos is covered in
      the <a href="../readme.html">ReadMe file</a>, we here give an
      introduction to building Trilinos in such a way that it contains
      everything that we need from the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> side.
    </p>


    <h5>Installing Trilinos</h5>

    <p style="color: red">
      Note: The current version of deal.II requires at least Trilinos 11.2.
      Deal.II is known to work with Trilinos 11.12.1. Others versions of
      Trilinos should work too but we do not do regression tests with them. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Trilinos uses <a href="http://cmake.org/">cmake</a> to configure and
      build. The following slightly longish set of commands will set up a
      reasonable configuration:
      <pre>

	cd trilinos-11.12.1
	mkdir build
	cd build

	cmake -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Sacado=ON \
	-D Trilinos_ENABLE_Stratimikos=ON \
	-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
	-D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-g -O3" \
	-D CMAKE_C_FLAGS="-g -O3" \
	-D CMAKE_FORTRAN_FLAGS="-g -O5" \
	-D Trilinos_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS="-lgfortran" \
	-D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=FALSE \
	-D Trilinos_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE=FALSE \
	-D TPL_ENABLE_MPI=ON \
	-D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
	-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/share/trilinos \
	..

	make install
      </pre>
      You will need to adjust the path into which you want to install Trilinos
      in the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX line.
    </p>


    <h5>Parallel builds</h5>

    <p>
      If your computer has more than one processor core, use
      <code>make -jN</code> instead of <code>make</code> in the last line
      above, where <code>N</code> is the number of processors you have.
    </p>


    <h5>BLAS and LAPACK</h5>

    <p>
      Trilinos sometimes searches for other libraries but can't find
      them if they are not in the usual directories or have other
      names. A common example are BLAS or LAPACK. In a case like
      this, you may have to specifically pass the directories and/or
      library names under which they can be found
      to <code>cmake</code>. For example, this may mean to add the
      following flags to the call above:
      <pre>

	-D BLAS_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING=goto \
	-D BLAS_LIBRARY_DIRS:STRING=/apps/GotoBLAS/lib64 \
	-D LAPACK_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING=lapack \
	-D LAPACK_LIBRARY_DIRS:STRING=/apps/lapack-3.2.1/lib64
      </pre>
    </p>


    <h5>Using external direct solvers</h5>

    <p>
      Trilinos (via its Amesos package) can interface with a number of direct
      solvers (see, for example,
      <a href="http://trilinos.org/docs/r11.8/packages/amesos/doc/html/index.html"
	 target="_top">this page for Trilinos 11.8</a>). Most of them are external
      packages to Trilinos and you will need to tell Trilinos configuration
      scripts that you want to use them, for example via the 
      <code>TrilinosWrappers::SolverDirect</code> class.  This can be tricky,
      but adding defines similar to the following to the cmake command line
      will achieve the goal to enable the UMFPACK and SuperLU/SuperLUDist
      solvers:
      <pre>

        -D TPL_ENABLE_UMFPACK:BOOL=ON \
        -D TPL_ENABLE_SuperLU:BOOL=ON \
        -D TPL_ENABLE_SuperLUDist:BOOL=ON \
        -D TPL_UMFPACK_INCLUDE_DIRS="/usr/include" \
        -D SuperLUDist_INCLUDE_DIRS:FILEPATH="/path/to/SuperLU_DIST_3.2/SRC" \
	-D TPL_SuperLUDist_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH="/path/to/SuperLU_DIST_3.2/lib/libsuperlu_dist.a" \
        -D SuperLU_INCLUDE_DIRS:FILEPATH="/path/to/SuperLU_4.3/SRC" \
        -D TPL_SuperLU_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH="/path/to/SuperLU_4.3/lib/libsuperlu_4.3.a"
      </pre>
      Similarly, to enable MUMPS, commands should include
      <pre>

        -D TPL_ENABLE_MUMPS:BOOL=ON \
        -D TPL_ENABLE_SCALAPACK:BOOL=ON
      </pre>
      and possibly followed by
      <pre>

        -D TPL_MUMPS_INCLUDE_DIRS:PATH=/usr/include/openmpi-x86_64 \
        -D SCALAPACK_LIBRARY_DIRS:PATH=/lib64/openmpi/lib \
      </pre>
      where you need to adjust the exact paths, of course.
