    <h2>System requirements</h2>

    <a name="supported" />
    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>

    <p>
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is mostly developed on Linux using the
        <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a> compiler. However, it is not platform specific and we strive to keep the source code compliant with the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/50372.html">C++ 2011
  Standard</a> (see also <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3337.pdf">here</a> for a copy of the C++11 standard).
    </p>

    <p>
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym> supports at least the following platforms:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>GNU/Linux: GCC version 4.9 or later; Clang version 4.0 or later; ICC versions 15 or later</li>
        <li>Mac OS X: GCC version 4.9 or later; Clang version 4.0 or later. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki/MacOSX" target="_top">deal.II Wiki</a> for installation instructions.</li>
        <li>Windows: experimental support for Visual Studio 2017. Please have a look at the
            <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#can-i-use-dealii-on-a-windows-platform">
      FAQ</a> and at the <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki/Windows" target="_top">deal.II Wiki</a> for more information and alternative solutions.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Most other combinations of POSIX-style operating systems and C++ Standard compliant compilers should also work. <i>If they don't,
  please report it as a bug.</i>
    </p>


    <a name="additional-software"></a>
    <h3>Additional software requirements</h3>

    <p>
        In order to compile and use <acronym>deal.II</acronym> you need to have the following programs installed:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_top">CMake</a> version 2.8.12 or later
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_top">GNU make</a>, version 3.78 or later (or any other generator supported by CMake)
        </li>

        <li>
            For generating the documentation:
            <a href="http://www.perl.org/" target="_top">Perl 5.x</a>,
            <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a> and <code>dot</code>, which is part of the
            <a href="http://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a> package
        </li>

        <li>
            For debugging programs, we have found that the
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/" target="_top">GNU
	    debugger GDB</a> is an invaluable tool. GDB is a text-based tool not always easy to use; <a href="http://www.kdbg.org/" target="_top">kdbg</a>, is one of many graphical user interfaces for it. Most integrated development environments
            like <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/" target="_top">kdevelop</a> or <a href="http://eclipse.org/" target="_top">Eclipse</a> have built in debuggers as well. <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has some support for pretty printing its own classes
            through GDB; see <a href="users/gdb.html">the GDB configuration guide</a> for setup information.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                The library generates output in formats readable by
                <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/" target="_top">GNUPLOT</a>,
                <a href="http://www.generalmeshviewer.com/" target="_top">GMV
 	  (general mesh viewer)</a>,
                <a href="http://www.tecplot.com/" target="_top">Tecplot</a> (ASCII and binary),
                <a href="http://www.vtk.org/" target="_top">Visualization Toolkit (Vtk)</a>,
                <a href="http://www.avs.com" target="_top">AVS Explorer</a>,
                <a href="http://www.opendx.org" target="_top">Open DX</a>,
                <a href="http://www.povray.org" target="_top">Povray</a>, and directly to Encapsulated Postscript.
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>gnuplot</code> and a postscript viewer (for <code>eps</code>) should be available almost everywhere. In the last few years, most new visualization programs have moved to support
                <code>vtk</code>/<code>vtu</code> format. There are a number of excellent programs that can read <code>vtk</code> and
                <code>vtu</code>, such as
                <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/visit/" target="_top">VisIt</a>,
                <a href="http://www.paraview.org/" target="_top">ParaView</a>, as well as others. Povray is freely available for almost all platforms. AVS is a commercial program available for most Unix flavors. Tecplot is a commercial program available
                for Windows and most Unix platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case you didn't find your favorite graphics format above, adding a new writer to <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is not too difficult, as only a simple intermediate format needs to be converted into output (without references to cells, nodes,
                types of finite elements, and the like).
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <a name="installation"></a>
    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <a name="unpacking"></a>
    <h3>Unpacking</h3>

    <p>
        The whole library usually comes as a <code>tar.gz</code> file, which is a file archive compressed with gzip. After downloading it, unpack it using either
    </p>
    <pre>
  gunzip deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
  tar xf deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar
    </pre>
    <p>or, if you have GNU tar with</p>
    <pre>
  tar -xvf deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    </pre>

    <p><b>Note:</b> You will want to hang on to the source files of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> after installation as it makes developing much simpler. Consequently, you should do the steps above in a permanent directory, not on <code>/tmp</code> as one often
        does when installing software.
    </p>

    <a name="configuration"></a>
    <h3>Configuring and building the library</h3>

    <p>
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses the
        <a href="http://www.cmake.org/" target="_top">CMake</a> integrated configuration and build system. Unpacking will create a subdirectory <tt>deal.II/</tt> in the current directory. Then do the following steps to configure the build process (make sure the installation directory is not the same as the location where you unpacked <tt>deal.II/</tt>):</p>

    <pre>
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir ../deal.II
    </pre>
    We recommend compiling deal.II in parallel if your machine has
    more than one processor core. This can be done by providing
    the <code>--jobs=N</code> flag to <code>make</code> with a
    numerical argument <code>N</code>. (The
    argument <code>--jobs=N</code> is often abbreviated
    as <code>-jN</code>.) Here we compile with four <code>make</code>
    jobs:
    <pre>
  make --jobs=4 install
  make test
    </pre>
    One should usually use one job for each processor core on the
    machine.

    <p>
        These steps compile, link, install the deal.II library, and run a few consistency checks. The whole process should take between a few minutes and an hour, depending on your machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Notes:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li> The part "<code>/path/to/install/dir</code>" in the
            command above needs to be replaced by the path to the directory which deal.II should be installed into. This can be a directory in your home directory (e.g., <code>~/bin/deal.II</code>) or a directory such as <code>/usr/local</code> if you have root privileges.
            Another option is to use something like <code>`pwd`/../installed/</code> (note the backticks).
        </li>

        <li> <code>make test</code> automatically runs in parallel and no <code>-jN</code> flag should be supplied to it.
        </li>

        <li> If you do not intend to modify the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> sources and recompile things, then you can remove the <code>build/</code> directory after the last step.
        </li>

        <li> In principle, after installing <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you can remove the source directory as well (i.e., the directory into which <code>tar</code> unpacked the file you downloaded) since projects using deal.II should only need files that
            have been installed. However, you will find it convenient to keep the source files around anyway, for one reason: When debugging you often end up with assertions for which you'd like to see the place in the library's source files that triggered
            it.
        </li>

        <li> The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> <code>CMake</code> system can accept a significant number of configuration parameters. See the discussion <a href="#configuration-options">below</a>.
        </li>

        <li> If you are changing part of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> code itself, you can re-compile the library using only the last two commands above in the previously created build directory. It is also possible to change the configuration used in this
            directory by calling <code>cmake</code> a second time, possibly with different arguments. However, this sometimes leads to surprising results and you may not get exactly what you were hoping for. For more information, see <a href="users/cmake_dealii.html">here</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Compilers require a lot of memory. If your machine has many
          cores but not so much memory, then using <code>-jN</code>
          with a large <code>N</code> might lead to situations where
          not enough memory is available for all compilers, and this
          typically manifests as an "internal compiler error" or a
          segmentation fault. If that happens, just
          reduce <code>N</code> and type the <code>make install</code>
          command again.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The commands above build and install the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> libraries in two variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><i>Debug mode</i>: This version of the library is compiled with compiler flags so that the library contains information that can be used by debuggers.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, this library contains a great number of safety checks on most arguments of all functions you could possibly call. These assertions have proven to be an invaluable means to finding programming bugs since they will almost always abort your
                program if something goes wrong. In our experience, more than ninety per cent of all errors are invalid parameters (such as vectors having the wrong size, etc.) and they are usually found almost instantaneously, displaying the file name
                and line number of where the problem occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
                With GCC Debug mode, by default, uses the <code>-Og</code> flag. It promises most of the debugging experience of <code>-O0</code> but at a better performance. This is a reasonable choice for unit tests and enables numerous asserts within
                the library. Sometimes, however, one needs Debug mode to use
                <code>-O0</code>, where all compiler optimizations are avoided and code and variables are exactly as indicated in the C++ program (e.g. with <code>-Og</code> GCC 6.2.0 optimizes out local variables). This can be achieved by configuring
                <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with
                <code>-DDEAL_II_HAVE_FLAG_Og=false</code>.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li> <i>Optimized mode</i>: You will want to link with this version of the library once you know that your program is working as expected. It does not contain the safety checks any more and is compiled with aggressive compiler optimizations. The resulting
            executables are smaller and will run between 2 and 10 times faster than the debug executables.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        At this point, you have generated everything necessary to write programs based on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. If you are new to
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you may want to continue with the
        <a href="doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>.
    </p>

    <a name="documentation"></a>
    <h3>Configuring and building the documentation</h3>

    <p>
        All the documentation about the version that you downloaded and that can be found at the <a href="http://www.dealii.org/" target="_top">
      http://www.dealii.org/</a> domain can also be generated locally. To do so, invoke <code>cmake</code> in the build instructions above as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
      cmake -DDEAL_II_COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/install/dir ../deal.II
      make documentation
      make install
    </pre>

    <p>
        As usual, you can pass <code>-jN</code> to <code>make</code>
        in order to use more than one processor.
        For this to succeed, you will need <a href="http://www.perl.org/" target="_top">Perl 5.x</a>,
        <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a> and <code>dot</code> (which is part of the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a> package) to be installed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The documentation contains links to pictures (e.g., for the tutorial programs) that are by default stored online at the dealii.org domain. If you want to use the documentation completely offline, you can run the <code>contrib/utilities/makeofflinedoc.sh</code>        script in an installed documentation directory to download all images.
    </p>

    <p> Finally, the default for locally installed documentation is to render formulas as images. You can force formulas to be displayed via the MathJax system by adding <code>-DDEAL_II_DOXYGEN_USE_MATHJAX=ON</code> to the CMake call above. These formulas
        are then rendered natively by the browser. With <code>-DDEAL_II_DOXYGEN_USE_ONLINE_MATHJAX=OFF</code> CMake will try to find a local installation of MathJax scripts, otherwise the online version of the scripts will be used in the documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Generating this documentation can take a <i>really long
      time</i> &mdash; running doxygen through our hundreds of thousands of lines of code can take 15-20 minutes even on a fast machine during which you will not get any output from <code>make</code>.
    </p>


    <a name="configuration-options"></a>
    <h3>Configuration options</h3>

    <p>
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has a large number of optional interfaces to other libraries. <b>By default, <code>cmake</code> will automatically
      enable support  for all external libraries it can find in default
      paths.</b> However, this behavior can be changed using command line switches to the initial call to <code>cmake</code>. A detailed description can be found here: <a href="users/cmake_dealii.html">Detailed build system description</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the following, let us summarize the most common configuration options.
    </p>

    <a name="optional-compilation" />
    <h4>Selecting optional compilation features</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li> <i>Unity build</i>: deal.II may be compiled with a unity build; that is, one may configure the build process so that the library is compiled as a few large files instead of many small ones. The unity build feature may be enabled by passing
                the <code>-DDEAL_II_UNITY_BUILD=ON</code> argument to <code>cmake</code>. This feature is disabled by default.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <a name="optional" />
    <h4>Selecting optional library features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Threading</i>: By default, deal.II supports parallelism between multiple cores on the same machine using threads and a task-based model built on the
                <a href="http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/" target="_top">Threading Building Blocks</a>. You can switch threading off by passing the <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_THREADS=OFF</code> argument to <code>cmake</code>.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <i>MPI</i>: To enable parallel computations beyond a single node using the <a href="http://mpi-forum.org/" target="_top">Message
	  Passing Interface (MPI)</a>, pass the
                <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON</code> argument to <code>cmake</code>. If <code>cmake</code> found MPI but you specifically do not want to use it, then pass <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=OFF</code>.
                The minimal supported version is MPI-2.0.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <i>64bit indices</i>: By default, deal.II uses
                unsigned int (32bit) indices for degrees of freedom,
                using the <code>types::global_dof_index</code> type.
                (The same is true for a few other index types such as the
                global number of cells.) This limits the number of
                cells or unknowns to approximately four billions. If
                larger problem must be solved, pass the
                <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_64BIT_INDICES=ON</code> argument to
                <code>cmake</code>. To use this option with
                PETSc, PETSc must be compiled
                with the option <code>--with-64-bit-indices</code>.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>



    <a name="optional-software" />
    <h4>Optional interfaces to other software packages</h4>

    <p>
        When configuring interfacing to external libraries, the
        <code>cmake</code> script by default tries to find all of these libraries in a number of standard locations on your file system. For <i>optional</i> interfaces, it gives up if the library is not found and <acronym>deal.II</acronym> will be built
        without support for them. However, there is one interface that we <i>need</i> to have: <a href="http://www.boost.org/" target="_top">BOOST 1.59</a> or newer. If it is not found externally <code>cmake</code> will resort to the bundled boost version
        that is part of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> tar file.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following paragraphs describe how the interfaces to the various packages, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> interacts with, can be configured.
    </p>

    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>The majority of libraries mentioned below should be readily
          packaged by most Linux distributions. Usually you need to
          install a <i>development</i> version of a library package,
          e.g. ending in <code>-dev</code> or <code>-devel</code>.
          After that <code>cmake</code> will automatically find the
          library and use it.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            Configuring the interface to a self compiled package, say <code>foo</code> can usually be done by specifying
            <code>-DFOO_DIR=/path/to/foo</code>. Alternatively, you can set <code>FOO_DIR</code> as an environment variable in your
            <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.cshrc</code> file so that you do not have to enter this argument again the next time you invoke <code>cmake</code> in a fresh build directory. Any value passed on the command line wins over a value that may be
            found in an environment variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            To explicitly enable or disable support for a library <code>foo</code> use the argument
            <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_FOO=ON</code> resp.
            <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_FOO=OFF</code> for <code>cmake</code>.
        </li>

                    <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS=OFF</code>. More details about compatibility and configuration can be found

                    <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">UMFPACK</a>, which is part of SuiteSparse, is a sparse direct solver that we often use in prototype codes where the goal is to simply get a linear system solved robustly.
                    The interface will be enabled by default, either using a version installed on your system of using a version that comes bundled with
                    <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. It can be disabled explicitly by using the
                    <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_UMFPACK=OFF</code> argument. To use a self compiled version, pass the argument
                    <code>-DUMFPACK_DIR=/path/to/umfpack</code> to the
                    <code>cmake</code> command.

                    SuiteSparse has its own license. To use it with
                    deal.II, please read it and make sure that you agree
                    with it. You can find the license of SuiteSparse inside
                    the SuiteSparse download at the link given above. We
                    include UMFPACK in the deal.II repository courtesy of
                    its author, <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/welcome.html">Timothy A. Davis</a>.

            <a href="http://zlib.net/" target="_top">zlib</a> is a software library used for lossless data-compression. It is used in deal.II whenever compressed data is to be written.
            <a href="http://zlib.net/" target="_top">zlib</a> should be readily packaged by most Linux distributions. To use a self compiled version, pass
            <code>-DZLIB_DIR=/path/to/zlib</code> to the deal.II CMake call.
