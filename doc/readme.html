    <h3>Supported platforms</h3>

    <p>
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is a platform-independent library
        written in
        <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/">C++</a>, with configuration and build support provided by
        <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
        Until deal.II version 9.5, deal.II used the C++14
        standard; subsequent versions require C++17 (see
        <a href="https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/standards">here</a>
        for PDFs of the various C++ standards).
    </p>

    <p>
        The easiest way to install <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is to use
        <a href="https://dealii.org/download.html">the many packages
            available for different platforms</a>.
        But it can of course also be compiled from scratch.
        Given that C++ compilers and CMake are available on a wide
        variety of platforms, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can be compiled
        on most widely used systems. In particular, we regularly test
        that it can be compiled using the GCC compiler (on Linux and
        Windows), Clang (on Linux, and both Intel- and ARM-based Apple
        Mac systems via Xcode), the Intel compiler (on Linux), and Microsoft
        Visual Studio (on Microsoft Windows), as long as these compilers
        are sufficiently new to support the required language
        standard. You may want to take a look
        at <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki" target="_top">deal.II Wiki</a> for instructions on specific
        platforms. In general, most combinations of POSIX-style operating systems
        and C++ Standard compliant compilers should work. <i>If they
            don't, please
            <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues">report it as a bug</a>.</i>
    </p>


    <a name="additional-software"></a>
    <h3>Additional software requirements</h3>

    <p>
        In order to compile and use <acronym>deal.II</acronym> you need to have the following programs installed:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.cmake.org/" target="_top">CMake</a> version 3.3.0 or later
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/" target="_top">GNU make</a> (version 3.78 or later), or any
            other generator supported by CMake such
            as <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">Ninja</a> or Visual Studio.
        </li>

        <li>
            For generating the documentation:
            <a href="https://www.perl.org/" target="_top">Perl 5.x</a>,
            <a href="https://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a> and <code>dot</code>, which is part of the
            <a href="https://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a> package
        </li>

        <li>
            For debugging programs, we have found that the
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/" target="_top">GNU
                debugger GDB</a> is an invaluable tool. GDB is a text-based tool not always easy to use; <a
                href="https://www.kdbg.org/" target="_top">kdbg</a>, is one of many graphical user interfaces for it.
            Most integrated development environments
            like <a href="https://www.kdevelop.org/" target="_top">kdevelop</a> or <a href="https://eclipse.org/"
                target="_top">Eclipse</a> have built in debuggers as well. <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has some support
            for pretty printing its own classes
            through GDB; see <a href="users/gdb.html">the GDB configuration guide</a> for setup information.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                The library generates output in formats readable by
                <a href="https://www.gnuplot.info/" target="_top">GNUPLOT</a>,
                <a href="https://www.generalmeshviewer.com/" target="_top">GMV
                    (general mesh viewer)</a>,
                <a href="https://www.tecplot.com/" target="_top">Tecplot</a> (ASCII and binary),
                <a href="https://www.vtk.org/" target="_top">Visualization Toolkit (Vtk)</a>,
                <a href="https://www.avs.com" target="_top">AVS Explorer</a>,
                <a href="https://www.opendx.org" target="_top">Open DX</a>,
                <a href="https://www.povray.org" target="_top">Povray</a>, and directly to Encapsulated Postscript.
            </p>

            <p>
                <code>gnuplot</code> and a postscript viewer (for <code>eps</code>) should be available almost
                everywhere. In the last few years, most new visualization programs have moved to support
                <code>vtk</code>/<code>vtu</code> format. There are a number of excellent programs that can read
                <code>vtk</code> and
                <code>vtu</code>, such as
                <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/visit/" target="_top">VisIt</a>,
                <a href="https://www.paraview.org/" target="_top">ParaView</a>, as well as others. Povray is freely
                available for almost all platforms. AVS is a commercial program available for most Unix flavors. Tecplot
                is a commercial program available
                for Windows and most Unix platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                In case you didn't find your favorite graphics format above, adding a new writer to
                <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is not too difficult, as only a simple intermediate format needs to be
                converted into output (without references to cells, nodes,
                types of finite elements, and the like).
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <a name="installation"></a>
    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <a name="unpacking"></a>
    <h3>Unpacking</h3>

    <p>
        The whole library usually comes as a <code>tar.gz</code> file, which is a file archive compressed with gzip.
        After downloading it, unpack it using either
    </p>
    <pre>
  gunzip deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
  tar xf deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar
    </pre>
    <p>or, if you have GNU tar with</p>
    <pre>
  tar -xvf deal.II-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    </pre>

    <p><b>Note:</b> You will want to hang on to the source files of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> after installation as it
        makes developing much simpler. Consequently, you should do the steps above in a permanent directory, not on
        <code>/tmp</code> as one often
        does when installing software.
    </p>

    <a name="configuration"></a>
    <h3>Configuring and building the library</h3>

    <p>
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses the
        <a href="https://www.cmake.org/" target="_top">CMake</a> integrated configuration and build system. Unpacking
        will create a subdirectory <tt>deal.II/</tt> in the current directory. Then do the following steps to configure
        the build process (make sure the installation directory is not the same as the location where you unpacked
        <tt>deal.II/</tt>):
    </p>

    <pre>
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir ../deal.II
    </pre>
    We recommend compiling deal.II in parallel if your machine has
    more than one processor core. This can be done by providing
    the <code>--jobs=N</code> flag to <code>make</code> with a
    numerical argument <code>N</code>. (The
    argument <code>--jobs=N</code> is often abbreviated
    as <code>-jN</code>.) Here we compile with four <code>make</code>
    jobs:
    <pre>
  make --jobs=4 install
  make test
    </pre>
    One should usually use one job for each processor core on the
    machine.

    <p>
        These steps compile, link, install the deal.II library, and run a few consistency checks. The whole process
        should take between a few minutes and an hour, depending on your machine.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Notes:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> The part "<code>/path/to/install/dir</code>" in the
            command above needs to be replaced by the path to the directory which deal.II should be installed into. This
            can be a directory in your home directory (e.g., <code>~/bin/deal.II</code>) or a directory such as
            <code>/usr/local</code> if you have root privileges.
            Another option is to use something like <code>`pwd`/../installed/</code> (note the backticks).
        </li>

        <li> <code>make test</code> automatically runs in parallel and no <code>-jN</code> flag should be supplied to
            it.
        </li>

        <li> If you do not intend to modify the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> sources and recompile things, then you can
            remove the <code>build/</code> directory after the last step.
        </li>

        <li> In principle, after installing <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you can remove the source directory as well
            (i.e., the directory into which <code>tar</code> unpacked the file you downloaded) since projects using
            deal.II should only need files that
            have been installed. However, you will find it convenient to keep the source files around anyway, for one
            reason: When debugging you often end up with assertions for which you'd like to see the place in the
            library's source files that triggered
            it.
        </li>

        <li> The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> <code>CMake</code> system can accept a significant number of configuration
            parameters. See the discussion <a href="#configuration-options">below</a>.
        </li>

        <li> If you are changing part of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> code itself, you can re-compile the library
            using only the last two commands above in the previously created build directory. It is also possible to
            change the configuration used in this
            directory by calling <code>cmake</code> a second time, possibly with different arguments. However, this
            sometimes leads to surprising results and you may not get exactly what you were hoping for. For more
            information, see <a href="users/cmake_dealii.html">here</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Compilers require a lot of memory. If your machine has many
            cores but not so much memory, then using <code>-jN</code>
            with a large <code>N</code> might lead to situations where
            not enough memory is available for all compilers, and this
            typically manifests as an "internal compiler error" or a
            segmentation fault. If that happens, just
            reduce <code>N</code> and type the <code>make install</code>
            command again.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The commands above build and install the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> libraries in two variants:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><i>Debug mode</i>: This version of the library is compiled with compiler flags so that the library
                contains information that can be used by debuggers.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, this library contains a great number of safety checks on most arguments of all functions
                you could possibly call. These assertions have proven to be an invaluable means to finding programming
                bugs since they will almost always abort your
                program if something goes wrong. In our experience, more than ninety per cent of all errors are invalid
                parameters (such as vectors having the wrong size, etc.) and they are usually found almost
                instantaneously, displaying the file name
                and line number of where the problem occurred.
            </p>
            <p>
                With GCC Debug mode, by default, uses the <code>-Og</code> flag. It promises most of the debugging
                experience of <code>-O0</code> but at a better performance. This is a reasonable choice for unit tests
                and enables numerous asserts within
                the library. Sometimes, however, one needs Debug mode to use
                <code>-O0</code>, where all compiler optimizations are avoided and code and variables are exactly as
                indicated in the C++ program (e.g. with <code>-Og</code> GCC 6.2.0 optimizes out local variables). This
                can be achieved by configuring
                <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with
                <code>-DDEAL_II_HAVE_FLAG_Og=false</code>.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li> <i>Optimized mode</i>: You will want to link with this version of the library once you know that your
            program is working as expected. It does not contain the safety checks any more and is compiled with
            aggressive compiler optimizations. The resulting
            executables are smaller and will run between 2 and 10 times faster than the debug executables.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        At this point, you have generated everything necessary to write programs based on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. If
        you are new to
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you may want to continue with the
        <a href="doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>.
    </p>

    <a name="documentation"></a>
    <h3>Configuring and building the documentation</h3>

    <p>
        All the documentation about the version that you downloaded and that can be found at the <a
            href="https://www.dealii.org/" target="_top">
            https://www.dealii.org/</a> domain can also be generated locally. To do so, invoke <code>cmake</code> in the
        build instructions above as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
      cmake -DDEAL_II_COMPONENT_DOCUMENTATION=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/install/dir ../deal.II
      make documentation
      make install
    </pre>

    <p>
        As usual, you can pass <code>-jN</code> to <code>make</code>
        in order to use more than one processor.
        For this to succeed, you will need <a href="https://www.perl.org/" target="_top">Perl 5.x</a>,
        <a href="https://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a> and <code>dot</code> (which is part of the <a
            href="https://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a> package) to be installed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The documentation contains links to pictures (e.g., for the tutorial programs) that are by default stored online
        at the dealii.org domain. If you want to use the documentation completely offline, you can run the
        <code>contrib/utilities/makeofflinedoc.sh</code> script in an installed documentation directory to download all
        images.
    </p>

    <p> Finally, the default for locally installed documentation is to render formulas as images. You can force formulas
        to be displayed via the MathJax system by adding <code>-DDEAL_II_DOXYGEN_USE_MATHJAX=ON</code> to the CMake call
        above. These formulas
        are then rendered natively by the browser. With <code>-DDEAL_II_DOXYGEN_USE_ONLINE_MATHJAX=OFF</code> CMake will
        try to find a local installation of MathJax scripts, otherwise the online version of the scripts will be used in
        the documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Generating this documentation can take a <i>really long
            time</i> &mdash; running doxygen through our hundreds of thousands of lines of code can take 15-20 minutes
        even on a fast machine during which you will not get any output from <code>make</code>.
    </p>


    <a name="configuration-options"></a>
    <h3>Configuration options</h3>

    <p>
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has a large number of optional interfaces to other libraries. <b>By default,
            <code>cmake</code> will automatically
            enable support for all external libraries it can find in default
            paths.</b> However, this behavior can be changed using command line switches to the initial call to
        <code>cmake</code>. A detailed description can be found here: <a href="users/cmake_dealii.html">Detailed build
            system description</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the following, let us summarize the most common configuration options.
    </p>

    <a name="optional-compilation" />
    <h4>Selecting optional compilation features</h4>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li> <i>Unity build</i>: deal.II may be compiled with a unity build; that is, one may configure the build
                process so that the library is compiled as a few large files instead of many small ones. The unity build
                feature may be enabled by passing
                the <code>-DDEAL_II_UNITY_BUILD=ON</code> argument to <code>cmake</code>. This feature is disabled by
                default.
        </p>
    </ul>

    <a name="optional" />
    <h4>Selecting optional library features</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Threading</i>: By default, deal.II supports parallelism between multiple cores on the same machine
                using threads and a task-based model built on the
                <a href="https://threadingbuildingblocks.org/" target="_top">Threading Building Blocks</a>. You can
                switch threading inside the library off by passing the <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_TBB=OFF</code> argument to
                <code>cmake</code>.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <i>MPI</i>: To enable parallel computations beyond a single node using the <a
                    href="https://mpi-forum.org/" target="_top">Message
                    Passing Interface (MPI)</a>, pass the
                <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=ON</code> argument to <code>cmake</code>. If <code>cmake</code> found MPI but
                you specifically do not want to use it, then pass <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_MPI=OFF</code>.
                The minimal supported version is MPI-3.0.
            </p>

                <i>64bit indices</i>: By default, deal.II uses

    <h4>Optional interfaces to other software packages</h4>

    <p>
        When configuring interfacing to external libraries, the
        <code>cmake</code> script by default tries to find all of these libraries in a number of standard locations on
        your file system. For <i>optional</i> interfaces, it gives up if the library is not found and
        <acronym>deal.II</acronym> will be built
        without support for them. However, there is one interface that we <i>need</i> to have: <a
            href="https://www.boost.org/" target="_top">BOOST 1.74</a> or newer. If it is not found externally
        <code>cmake</code> will resort to the bundled boost version
        that is part of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> tar file.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following paragraphs describe how the interfaces to the various packages, <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
        interacts with, can be configured.
    </p>

    <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>The majority of libraries mentioned below should be readily
                packaged by most Linux distributions. Usually you need to
                install a <i>development</i> version of a library package,
                e.g. ending in <code>-dev</code> or <code>-devel</code>.
                After that <code>cmake</code> will automatically find the
                library and use it.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            Configuring the interface to a self compiled package, say <code>foo</code> can usually be done by specifying
            <code>-DFOO_DIR=/path/to/foo</code>. Alternatively, you can set <code>FOO_DIR</code> as an environment
            variable in your
            <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.cshrc</code> file so that you do not have to enter this argument again the
            next time you invoke <code>cmake</code> in a fresh build directory. Any value passed on the command line
            wins over a value that may be
            found in an environment variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            To explicitly enable or disable support for a library <code>foo</code> use the argument
            <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_FOO=ON</code> resp.
            <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_FOO=OFF</code> for <code>cmake</code>.

                The <a href="https://www.ce.uniroma2.it/research/psblas/" target="_top">PSBLAS</a> library facilitates
                the parallelization of scientific applications by providing routines for iterative solvers for sparse
                linear systems, sparse matrix operations, and dense matrix operations using a distributed memory model,
                both on CPUs and GPUs.

            <p>
                To disable the PSBLAS interfaces in cases where <code>cmake</code> automatically finds it, use
                <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_PSBLAS=OFF</code>. More information on configuring and building PSBLAS can be found

                version that comes bundled with deal.II cannot be
                compiled, for example because no version of LAPACK
