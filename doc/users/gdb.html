    <h1>Configuration for debugging deal.II projects via GDB</h1>

    <p><acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with a simple set of pretty-printers
      that provide descriptions to GDB (the GNU debugger) on how to usefully
      print <acronym>deal.II</acronym> objects. For example, without
      pretty-printing, GDB prints points as</p>
    <pre class="sample">
(gdb) print point
$1 = {&lt;dealii::Tensor&lt;1, 2, double&gt;&gt; = {static dimension = &lt;optimized out&gt;,
static rank = &lt;optimized out&gt;, static n_independent_components = &lt;optimized out&gt;, values = {{
static dimension = &lt;optimized out&gt;, static rank = &lt;optimized out&gt;,
static n_independent_components = &lt;optimized out&gt;, value = 0}, {
static dimension = &lt;optimized out&gt;, static rank = &lt;optimized out&gt;,
static n_independent_components = &lt;optimized out&gt;, value = 0}}}, &lt;No data fields&gt;}</pre>
    but with pretty-printing enabled GDB prints
    <pre class="sample">
(gdb) print point
$1 = {0, 0}</pre>
    which is much easier to read.</p>

<h2>Setting up GDB for just deal.II</h2>
<p>If you only plan on using GDB with <acronym>deal.II</acronym> then it
  suffices to rename the provided GDB pretty-printing file and place it in your
  home directory. This can be done with the following shell commands
  (where <code>dealii_source_directory</code> is the root directory containing
  all <acronym>deal.II</acronym> source files):
  <pre class="sample">
cd dealii_source_directory
cp contrib/utilities/dotgdbinit.py ~/.gdbinit</pre>
</p>

<h2>Setting up GDB for deal.II and other sets of printers</h2>
<p>
  Configuring GDB to use multiple sets of pretty-printers (i.e., sets of
  pretty-printers from <acronym>deal.II</acronym> as well as other projects)
  takes a little more work. The recommended procedure is
  <ol>
    <li> Decide on a directory where you will place all of your pretty-printing
      files. A good choice would be creating a new
      folder <code>.gdbscripts</code> in your home directory, and this is the
      choice assumed for the rest of this demonstration.
    <li> Move the Python source code parts (so everything after, and not
      including, the line containing just the word <code>python</code> near the
      beginning up to (and also not including) the line containing just the
      word <code>end</code>) of the
      file <code>contrib/utilities/dotgdbinit.py</code> into the directory from
      the first step. Rename this file to <code>deal.py</code> so that we can
      import it into the principal GDB configuration file in the next step.
    <li> Add the following to your <code>.gdbinit</code> file, which also
      resides in your home directory:
      <pre class="sample">
set print pretty 1

python

import os
import sys
sys.path.append(os.path.expanduser("~/.gdbscripts/"))
import deal

end</pre>
      The statements between <code>python</code> and <code>end</code> are
      executed as python code by GDB. The line
      <pre class="sample">
import deal</pre>
      executes the code necessary to enable the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      pretty-printers (it loads the file created in the last step).
  </ol>
  Use a similar procedure on other pretty-printing files (which should also be
  located in <code>.gdbscripts/</code>) to set up any other pretty-printing
  code.
