    <h1>Setting up testsuite in user projects</h1>

    <p>
      This page provides details about how to set up a testsuite in a user
      project similar to the one that is used to test deal.II itself.

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      deal.II features an extensive <a
        href="../developers/testsuite.html">testsuite</a> to ensure
      consistent, well-defined behavior of its building blocks during
      development and for releases. But, the larger a user program/project
      becomes, the more important it is to also check user code for
      continued correctness during development. This is mainly done via
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit</a> and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">regression testing</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      deal.II provides a mechanism to conveniently set up unit and
      regression tests in a user project (very much like they are handled
      in the library itself). At its heart a test is a small executable
      that is invoked and an output file for comparison. The executable
      that should be run can be defined in two different ways: Either as a
      source file in conjunction with a comparison file:
      <pre>
my_test_1.cc
my_test_1.output</pre>
      In this case <code>my_test_1.cc</code> contains a full executable (with
      a main function) that produces some output. The screen output is then
      compared against <code>my_test_1.output</code>. Alternatively, a
      parameter file together with a comparison file can be provided:
      <pre>
my_test_2.prm
my_test_2.output</pre>
      In this case an already built executable (that is defined by a CMake
      variable) is invoked with the path of <code>my_test_2.prm</code> as
      first argument. Again, its screen output is compared against
      <code>my_test_2.output</code>
      <pre>
my_test_3.json
my_test_3.output</pre>
      Just like in the last case, an already built executable (that is defined by a CMake
      variable) is invoked with the path of <code>my_test_3.json</code> as
      first argument. Again, its screen output is compared against
      <code>my_test_3.output</code>
    </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
      This section presents two different examples of how to use the
      testsuite facilities. Possible directory layouts together with the
      necessary CMake configuration are discussed.
    </p>

    <a name="simple"></a>
    <h3>Simple configuration</h3>

    <p>
      For the purpose of an example, let us pretend that step-1 could read
      input files (defined on the command line) and do some computation
      based on their contents. Then, we can set up tests for expected
      output for given a given configuration file.

      This can be done by creating a subdirectory <code>tests</code> and
      adding a test of the second type (i.e., parameter file and comparison
      file). In detail the directory and file layout is as follows:
      <pre>
CMakeLists.txt
step-1.cc
tests/CMakeLists
tests/my_test.output
tests/my_test.prm</pre>
      In order to enable testing the top-level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>
      file has to be augmented by a call to <code>ENABLE_TESTING()</code>
      and a subsequent descent into the <code>tests/</code> subdirectory via
      <code>ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(tests)</code>. For convenience, here is the
      full top-level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file:
      <pre class="cmake">
SET(TARGET step-1)
SET(TARGET_SRC step-1.cc)

CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 3.13.4)
FIND_PACKAGE(deal.II 9.7.0 REQUIRED
  HINTS ${deal.II_DIR} ${DEAL_II_DIR} ../ ../../ $ENV{DEAL_II_DIR}
  )

DEAL_II_INITIALIZE_CACHED_VARIABLES()
PROJECT(${TARGET})
DEAL_II_INVOKE_AUTOPILOT()

# Enable testing and descent into tests/ subdirectory:
ENABLE_TESTING()
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(tests)</pre>
      The corresponding file <code>tests/CMakeLists.txt</code> contains
      only two statements:
      <pre class="cmake">
SET(TEST_TARGET ${TARGET})
DEAL_II_PICKUP_TESTS()</pre>
      The first statement sets the variable <code>TEST_TARGET</code> to the
      executable that should be invoked (in our case the contents of the
      variable <code>TARGET</code>). The second statement is a call to a
      deal.II macro that will go through the directory contents and define
      all test targets.
    </p>

    <p>Due to the fact that step-1 produces only two lines of output and
    parses no parameters, we can set up a somewhat silly test by just
    providing the comparison file and an empty parameter file:
    <pre>
$ touch tests/my_test.prm
$ echo "Grid written to grid-1.eps" >  tests/my_test.output
$ echo "Grid written to grid-2.eps" >> tests/my_test.output</pre>
    After that, reconfigure and call the test driver <code>ctest</code>:
    <pre>
$ cmake .
[...]
$ ctest
Test project .../examples/step-1
    Start 1: tests/my_test.debug
1/1 Test #1: tests/my_test.debug ..............   Passed    1.72 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   1.72 sec</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Remark:</i> If the parameter file ends in <code>.prm.in</code>
      instead of <code>.prm</code>, it will be configured/preprocessed to a
      test.prm file. This is done with the CMake macro
      <code>CONFIGURE_FILE</code> that replaces all strings
      <code>@VARIABLE@</code> with the contents of the corresponding CMake
      variable. This is useful in particular to conveniently substitute
      <code>@SOURCE_DIR@</code> with the full source directory path of the
      test.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Remark:</i> The test driver will compare the combined output
      stream of stdout and stderr against the comparison file. If the test
      creates a file <code>output</code> and writes to it, the comparison
      file is compared against this output file instead. In this case
      stdout and stderr are discarded.
    </p>

    <a name="advanced"></a>
    <h3>Advanced configuration</h3>

    <p>
      Above setup is too inflexible for larger projects that might consist
      of individual libraries and an independent main program. Therefore,
      as a second example a project is presented that consists of a support
      library "support" and an executable "step". The task shall be to
      provide unit tests for the library "support" and simple configuration
      type tests for "step". We shall assume that all the
      functions and classes are declared in a single header <code>support.h</code>
      to be included <code>#include &lt;support.h&gt;</code> from the executable "step"
      and units tests for the library.
      In detail the directory and file layout is as follows:
      <pre>
CMakeLists.txt

src/CMakeLists.txt
src/step.cc
src/support.cc

include/support.h

tests/step/CMakeLists
tests/step/my_test_1.prm
tests/step/my_test_1.output

tests/support/CMakeLists
tests/support/my_test_2.cc
tests/support/my_test_2.output</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, we want to use the "autopilot" configuration for user projects
      (see the <a href="cmake_user.html">cmake documentation</a> for
      details). The top-level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> is now solely
      responsible for finding deal.II, enable testing, and descending into
      subdirectories:
      <pre class="cmake">
# top-level CMakelists.txt

CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 3.13.4)
FIND_PACKAGE(deal.II 9.7.0 REQUIRED
  HINTS ${deal.II_DIR} ${DEAL_II_DIR} ../ ../../ $ENV{DEAL_II_DIR}
  )

DEAL_II_INITIALIZE_CACHED_VARIABLES()
PROJECT(step)
ENABLE_TESTING()

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(src)
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(tests/step)
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(tests/support)</pre>
      The library and executable are defined in
      <code>src/CMakeLists.txt</code>:
      <pre class="cmake">
# src/CMakeLists.txt

# set up shared library by hand:
ADD_LIBRARY(support SHARED support.cc)
DEAL_II_SETUP_TARGET(support)

# set up executable with autopilot macro:
SET(TARGET "step")
SET(TARGET_SRC step.cc)
DEAL_II_INVOKE_AUTOPILOT()
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${TARGET} support)</pre>

      Similarly to the first example, setting up tests for the executable
      "step" is just a matter of defining a variable and a call to a macro:
      <pre class="cmake">
# tests/step/CMakeLists.txt

SET(TEST_TARGET step)
DEAL_II_PICKUP_TESTS()</pre>
      In contrast, the tests for the support library consist of a source file
      that has a main function. The object file generated from this source
      file will be linked against deal.II and every library listed in
      <code>TEST_LIBRARIES</code>:
      <pre class="cmake">
# tests/support/CMakeLists.txt

SET(TEST_LIBRARIES support)
DEAL_II_PICKUP_TESTS()</pre>
    Again, reconfigure and run ctest:
      <pre>
$ cmake .
$ ctest
Test project .../examples/step
    Start 1: step/my_test_1.debug
1/2 Test #1: step/my_test_1.debug .............   Passed    0.21 sec
    Start 2: support/my_test_2.debug
2/2 Test #2: support/my_test_2.debug ..........   Passed    0.22 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 2

Total Test time (real) =   0.43 sec</pre>
    In some cases, additional input data has to be provided in users' tests. For
    example, we may have an input file
      <pre>
tests/support/my_test_2.input</pre>
    which shall be parsed within <code>my_test_2.cc</code>. To read this file,
    one can use the <code>SOURCE_DIR</code> preprocessor variable which will be equal
    to the parent folder of each <code>.cc</code> test. In other words, given the current
    imaginary directory structure, <code>const std::string str = std::string(SOURCE_DIR) + "/my_test_2.input";</code>
    used from <code>my_test_2.cc</code> will contain the path to the
    auxiliary input file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Remark:</i> For further information consult the <a
        href="../developers/testsuite.html">testsuite documentation</a> for
      the library. With the sole exception of the testsuite setup (that
      happens unconditionally in user testsuites), this documentation also
      applies for user testsuites.
    </p>

    <p>
    <i>Remark:</i> The full configuration options for
      <code>DEAL_II_PICKUP_TESTS()</code> are:
    </p>
    <pre>
TEST_LIBRARIES
TEST_LIBRARIES_DEBUG
  - additionally used for tests with debug configuration
TEST_LIBRARIES_RELEASE
  - additionally used for tests with release configuration

TEST_TARGET or
TEST_TARGET_DEBUG and TEST_TARGET_RELEASE
  - used instead of TEST_TARGET for debug/release configuration

NUMDIFF_EXECUTABLE
  - pointing to a valid "numdiff" executable

TEST_TIME_LIMIT
  - Specifies the maximal wall clock time in seconds a test is allowed
    to run.

TEST_MPI_RANK_LIMIT
  - Specifies the maximal number of MPI ranks that can be used. If a
    test variant configures a larger number of MPI ranks (via
    .mpirun=N. in the output file) than this limit the test will be
    dropped. The special value 0 enforces no limit. Defaults to 0.

TEST_THREAD_LIMIT
  - Specifies the maximal number of worker threads that can be used by the
    threading backend. If a test variant configures a larger number of threads
    (via .threads=N. in the output file) than this limit the test will be
    dropped. Note that individual tests might exceed this limit by calling
    MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit(), or by manually creating additional
    threads. The special value 0 enforces no limit. Defaults to 0.</pre>
