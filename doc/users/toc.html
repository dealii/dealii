<h1>Information for Users</h1>

<p>
<br />
This page gathers some information on developing programs based on
<acronym>deal.II</acronym>, as well as on how to configure and use
<acronym>deal.II</acronym>. At present, we have the following resources
available:
</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

<ul>

<li> <p>
     <a href="cmake.html">deal.II CMake documentation</a>:
     This page provides extensive information about configuration and
     installation with the CMake build system.

     <li> <p><a href="cmakelists.html" target="body">Using CMake and
       <acronym>deal.II</acronym> in a user project</a>:
     This page covers how to use CMake in your own project.
     An overview of how to retrieve necessary information
     from a <acronym>deal.II</acronym> installation as well as how to
     write a <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> for a client project is given.
     </p>

<li> <p><a href="doxygen.html">Linking your online documentation
      to the deal.II online manual</a>: After spending a lot of time
    writing good documentation for your code and putting it online,
    here we explain how to put links to the deal.II online manual into
    your documentation, so that readers can click through.
  </p>

<li> <p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/dealii/issues/list" target="_top">Bugs</a>:
     Though well tested, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> certainly has
     bugs. If you want to report a bug (or enhancement request),
     go to the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dealii/issues/list"
     target="_top">bug tracking system</a> and enter a new ticket
     for your issue.
     </p>

</ul>


<h2>Tutorials</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/Tutorial.html"
   target="_top">tutorial</a> is for new users of the
  library. It explains the basic elements of finite element
  programs based on the library, and provides small example
  programs. You can also reach the tutorial link from the
  menu bar at the left. There is also an extensive set of
  Youtube-hosted video lectures that provide both the
  context of the mathematical and computational methods of
  deal.II as well as demonstrate parts of the
  tutorial. These video lectures are also reachable from
  the menu bar at the left.
</p>

<p>
  As all other documentation, the HTML pages
  of the tutorials can be generated locally on your computer and
  can then be read offline. Please follow the
  instructions in the
  <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a> on how to
  generate them locally.
</p>


<h2>Programming interface</h2>

<p>
The <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/index.html" target="_top">programming
  interface/manual</a> pages are what you will need most often as a
reference of all classes, functions and variables in the library. They
are extensively documented (presently more than 5000 pages if
printed), and generated by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/"
                              target="_top">Doxygen</a>. There is also a quick link to these pages from
the menu bar at the left.
</p>

<p>
The documentation uses many of the features of Doxygen. In particular,
the link takes you straight to a page that lists <i>modules</i>, a way
to group classes with similar purposes. This may be what you are probably
interested in when you are not yet familiar with the library. If you
already know your way around and want to look up the signature of a
particular member function, for example, you may go to the class view or
choose any of the other ways in which Doxygen allows you to navigate
through the documentation.
</p>

<p>
Just as for the tutorials, the API docs need to be generated first,
if you download <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. Please follow the
instructions in the
<a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a> on how to do
this.
