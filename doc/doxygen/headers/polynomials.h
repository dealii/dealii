/**
 * @defgroup Polynomials Polynomials and polynomial spaces
 *
 * This module groups classes that define certain families of polynomial
 * functions. In particular, this includes Lagrangian interpolation
 * polynomials for equidistant support points and their tensor products in
 * higher dimensions, but also more exotic ones like Brezzi-Douglas-Marini or
 * Raviart-Thomas spaces.
