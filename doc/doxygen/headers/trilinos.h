 * @defgroup TrilinosWrappers TrilinosWrappers
 *
 * The classes in this group are wrappers around functionality
 * provided by the Trilinos library. They provide a modern
 * object-oriented interface that is compatible with the interfaces of
 * the other linear algebra classes in deal.II. All classes and
 * functions in this group reside in a namespace @p TrilinosWrappers.
 *
 * These classes are only available if a Trilinos installation was
 * detected during configuration of deal.II. Refer to the README file
 * for more details about this.
