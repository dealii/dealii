/**
 * @page CodeGallery The deal.II code gallery
 *
 * The deal.II code gallery contains a collection of programs based on deal.II
 * that were contributed by others to serve as starting points for more complex
 * applications. The code gallery is an extension of the @ref Tutorial "tutorial"
 * in that the programs are intended to show how applications can be
 * implemented with deal.II, but without the requirement to have these code
 * documented at the same, extensive level as used in the tutorial.
 * Instructions for obtaining the code gallery programs can be found at
 * https://dealii.org/code-gallery.html .
 *
 * @warning The programs that form part of the code gallery are contributed by
 *   others and are not part of deal.II itself. The deal.II authors make
 *   no assurances that these programs are documented in any reasonable way,
 *   nor that the programs are in fact correct. Please contact the authors
 *   of the code gallery programs if you have questions.
 *
 * The code gallery currently consists of the following programs (with
 * connections to other programs shown in the graph on the
 * @ref TutorialConnectionGraph "tutorial page"):
