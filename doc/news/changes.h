<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>

  <li> Changed: The signature of the FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(),
  FiniteElement::fill_fe_face_values(), and FiniteElement::fill_fe_subface_values()
  functions has been changed, in an effort to clarify which of these contain
  input information and which contain output information for these functions.

<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>

  <li> New: IndexSet now implements iterators.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/12)
  </li>

</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>



<ol>

  <li> Fixed: bug in DynamicSparsityPattern::iterator would cause invalid
  stl::vector::iterator comparison.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: FESystem now does some work in parallel if your system
  has multiple processors.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: When using FESystem with base elements that require
  information other than the determinant of the Jacobian (e.g.,
  elements that require the Jacobian itself), then this information
  was not passed down to FiniteElement::fill_fe_values of the
  base element. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Zhen Tao, 2015/07/17)
  </li>

  <li> New: The parallel::distributed::Triangulation can now be told to
  partition the cells so that the sum of certain weights associated with each
  cell, rather than the number of cells, is roughly constant between processors.
  This is done by passing a vector of weights to the function that repartitions
  the triangulation, parallel::distributed::Triangulation::repartition().
