<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Changed: Implicit conversion from Tensor@<1,dim@> to Point@<dim@> was
  previously possible. This has now been prohibited (but you can still
  do the conversion with an explicit cast) as such conversions are
  likely incorrect uses of class Point (which should represent only
  points in space, i.e., vectors anchored at the origin) whereas Tensor
  should be used for vectors anchored elsewhere (such as normal vectors,
  directions, differences between points, etc). The difference in
  usage between Point and Tensor have now been clarified in the documentation
  of class Point.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The project configuration no longer exports
  <code>[...]/include/deal.II</code>. Thus it is now mandatory to prefix
  all includes of deal.II headers with <code>deal.II/</code>, i.e.
  <code>#include &lt;deal.II/[...]&gt;</code>.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/19)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: ParameterHandler::leave_subsection() no longer returns a bool
  indicating if there was a subsection to leave. This never worked in the
  first place, because an exception was thrown.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/01/19)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: Make.global_options was completely redesigned. It still
  contains Makefile sourcable information, but they now closely mimic the
  declarative style of deal.IIConfig.cmake. Thus, projects that still use
  Makefiles that source Make.global_options have to be ported to the new
  layout.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The Component compat_files was removed entirely. deal.II
  now always configures and installs with a somewhat FSHS compliant
  directory structure. Further, the ancient make_dependencies binary was
  removed. Either migrate your project to CMake, or port your build system
  to the new (incompatible) Make.global_options found at
  <code>\${DEAL_II_SHARE_RELDIR}</code>.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The two-argument call to the MPI_InitFinalize constructor
  used to imply that the user wanted only one thread per MPI process. This
  has been changed and now means that every processor core on the system is
  used. If you run as many MPI processes as there are processor cores, then
  this means one thread per MPI process, as before. On the other hand, if you
  start fewer MPI processes than there are cores, then your program will now
  be allowed to use more than one thread. You can get the old behavior by
  setting the third (optional) argument to one.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/01/14)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix copy constructor got removed
  to be in line with PETSc and dealii::SparseMatrix. You can use reinit()
  and copy_from().
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The following compatibility definitions were removed from
  <code>include/deal.II/base/config.h.in</code> (replacement in brackets):
  - DEAL_II_CAN_USE_CXX11 (new: DEAL_II_WITH_CXX11)
  - DEAL_II_CAN_USE_CXX1X (new: DEAL_II_WITH_CXX11)
  - DEAL_II_COMPILER_SUPPORTS_MPI (new: DEAL_II_WITH_MPI)
  - DEAL_II_MAJOR (new: DEAL_II_VERSION_MAJOR)
  - DEAL_II_MINOR (new: DEAL_II_VERSION_MINOR)
  - DEAL_II_USE_ARPACK (new: DEAL_II_WITH_ARPACK)
  - DEAL_II_USE_CXX11 (new: DEAL_II_WITH_CXX11)
  - DEAL_II_USE_METIS (new: DEAL_II_WITH_METIS)
  - DEAL_II_USE_MT (new: DEAL_II_WITH_THREADS)
  - DEAL_II_USE_P4EST (new: DEAL_II_WITH_P4EST)
  - DEAL_II_USE_PETSC (new: DEAL_II_WITH_PETSC)
  - DEAL_II_USE_SLEPC (new: DEAL_II_WITH_SLEPC)
  - DEAL_II_USE_TRILINOS (new: DEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS)
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The direct Mumps interface through
  <code>SparseDirectMUMPS</code> has been removed. The MUMPS solver is
  still available through the Trilinos or PETSc interfaces. Alternatively,
  there is <code>SparseDirectUMFPACK</code>, which has a similar interface.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/11)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: This release removes a number of functions that have long
  been deprecated and that were previously already marked as
  deprecated (i.e., they would have yielded warnings by the compiler whenever
  you tried to use them). In almost all cases, there is a function with same
  name but different argument list that should be used instead.
  Specifically, the removed functions and classes are:
  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/base/</code>:</em>
  - ThreadManagement::spawn.
  - Threads::ThreadCondition and Threads::ThreadMutex.
  - DataOutBase::create_xdmf_entry with 3 arguments.
  - DataOutBase::write_hdf5_parallel with 2 arguments.
  - The versions of FunctionParser::initialize that took a
    <code>use_degrees</code> or <code>constants</code> argument.
    The implementation as it is now no longer supports either of
    these two concepts (since we switched from the FunctionParser
    library to the muparser library after the deal.II 8.1 release).
  - GridOutFlags::XFig::level_color.
  - class BlockList.
  - The MPI support functions in namespace Utilities and Utilities::System.
  - Deprecated members of namespace types.
  - Namespace deal_II_numbers.
  - MultithreadInfo::n_default_threads.
  - Table::data.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/lac/</code>:</em>
  - The deprecated constructors of SparseMIC,
    SparseILU, and SparseLUDecomposition.
  - SparseMIC::decompose and SparseILU::decompose.
  - SparseMIC::reinit and SparseLUDecomposition::reinit.
  - SparseILU::apply_decomposition.
  - The compress() functions without argument in the various vector
    classes. You should use the versions with a VectorOperation
    argument instead.
  - Vector::scale.
  - TrilinosWrappers::*Vector*::compress with an Epetra_CombineMode
    argument.
  - SparsityPattern and ChunkSparsityPattern functions that take an
    <code>optimize_diagonal</code> argument.
  - SparsityPattern::partition.
  - SparsityPattern::get_rowstart_indices and
    SparsityPattern::get_column_numbers.
  - The typedef CompressedBlockSparsityPattern.
  - The deprecated constructors of SparsityPattern iterator classes.
  - The deprecated variants of DoFTools::make_periodicity_constraints.
  - BlockMatrixArray and BlockTrianglePreconditioner functions that
    take an explicit VectorMemory object.
  - The SolverSelector constructor that takes a VectorMemory argument.
  - The version of parallel::distributed::Vector::compress_finish
    function that takes a boolean as argument.
  - The version of BlockVector::scale and
    parallel::distributed::Vector::scale,
    parallel::distributed::BlockVector::scale
    function that takes a scalar as argument.
  - PreconditionBlock::size.
  - Classes PreconditionedMatrix and PreconditionLACSolver.
  - PETScWrappers::VectorBase::update_ghost_values.
  - PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector constructors and reinit variants.
  - SparseMatrixIterators::Accessor and SparseMatrixIterators::Iterator
    constructors.
  - SparseMatrix::raw_entry and SparseMatrix::global_entry.
  - The ConstraintMatrix functions that transform a matrix, vector, or
    linear system into a smaller by not just setting the corresponding
    rows and columns to zero, but actually shrinking the size of the
    linear system.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/deal.II/</code>:</em>
  - GridGenerator::laplace_transformation.
  - The version of GridGenerator::parallelogram where the corners are given
    as a rank-2 tensor rather than as an array of points.
  - GridTools::create_union_triangulation.
  - GridTools::extract_boundary_mesh.
  - Triangulation::distort_random.
  - Triangulation::clear_user_pointers.
  - The refinement listener concept of the Triangulation class. This
    approach to getting notified about what happens to triangulations
    has been superseded by the signals defined by the triangulation
    class.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/fe/</code>:</em>
  - In FEValues and related classes, the functions that contain the
    term <code>2nd_derivatives</code> were removed in favor of those
    with names containing <code>hessian</code>. Similarly, functions
    with names including <code>function_grads</code> were removed in
    favor of those called <code>function_gradients</code>. Finally,
    the <code>cell_normal_vector</code> functions were replaced by
    <code>normal_vector</code> ones. In all cases, the new functions
    have been around for a while.
  - Mapping::transform_covariant and Mapping::transform_contravariant.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/dofs/</code>:</em>
  - DoFRenumbering::downstream_dg.
  - DoFTools::count_dofs_per_component.
  - DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern with a vector-of-vector mask.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/multigrid/</code>:</em>
  - The constructors of classes MGSmoother, MGSmootherRelaxation and
    MGSmootherPrecondition that take a VectorMemory object.
  - MGLevelObject::get_minlevel and MGLevelObject::get_maxlevel.
  - MGConstrainedDoFs::non_refinement_edge_index
  - MGConstrainedDoFs::at_refinement_edge_boundary
  - MGTools::count_dofs_per_component.
  - MGTools::apply_boundary_values.
  - MGTools::extract_inner_interface_dofs.
  - Class MGMatrix.
  - Multigrid::vmult and friends.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/matrix_free/</code>:</em>
  - Classes FEEvaluationDGP, FEEvaluationGeneral and FEEvaluationGL.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/mesh_worker/</code>:</em>
  - Deprecated variants of MeshWorker::loop and MeshWorker::integration_loop.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/algorithm/</code>:</em>
  - Algorithms::ThetaTimestepping::operator().
  - Algorithms::ThetaTimestepping::initialize.
  - Algorithms::Newton::initialize.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/numerics/</code>:</em>
  - TimeDependent::end_sweep (with an argument).
  - PointValueHistory::mark_locations.
  - The DataPostprocessor::compute_derived_quantities_scalar and
    DataPostprocessor::compute_derived_quantities_vector functions without
    evaluation points. If you have
    data postprocessor classes implemented in your program that overload these
    functions, you will have to change it in a way that they overload the
    functions of same name but with the evaluation point argument instead.
  <br>
  This release also removes the deprecated class MGDoFHandler. The
  functionality of this class had previously been incorporated into
  the DoFHandler class. Unlike the changes above, if you were still
  using this class, you will need to do the following changes to
  your code:
  - Where you called <code>mg_dof_handler.distribute_dofs()</code>
    you now also need to explicitly call
    <code>mg_dof_handler.distribute_mg_dofs()</code>.
  - If you called <code>mg_dof_handler.begin(level)</code>, you
    will now have to write this as
    <code>mg_dof_handler.begin_mg(level)</code> to make clear that
    you are not just interested in an iterator to a cell on a given
    level, but in fact to a cell that can access the degrees of
    freedom on a particular level of a multigrid hierarchy.
  - The type previously referred to as
    <code>MGDoFHandler::cell_iterator</code> now corresponds to
    <code>MGDoFHandler::level_cell_iterator</code>.
  - Where you previously called DoFRenumbering::component_wise
    for the entire MGDoFHandler object, you now need to call
    this function for the DoFHandler object, and then call the
    same function with the <code>level</code> argument for each
    of the levels of the triangulation individually.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/12/29-2015/01/22)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The config.h file no longer exports HAVE_* definitions.
  Those are either entirely removed (for the blas/lapack symbols) or
  renamed to DEAL_II_HAVE_*. This change is done in order to avoid clashes
  with external projects also exporting HAVE_* definitions in their header
  files.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/12/29)
  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>
  <li> Changed: We have traditionally used Point@<dim@> to represent points
  in physical space, i.e., vectors that are anchored at the origin, whereas
  for vectors anchored elsewhere (e.g., differences between points, normal
  vectors, gradients, etc) we have used Tensor@<1,dim@>. This has now be
  made more formal in the documentation but also in the return types of
  <code>operator-()</code> for Point objects: The difference between two
  points, <code>p1-p2</code> now returns a Tensor@<1,dim@>. On the other
  hand, subtracting a Tensor@<1,dim@> object from a Point, <code>p-t</code>,
  results in a Point@<dim@>.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/05)
  </li>

  <li> New: Examples from 1 to 16 now use the Manifold interface
  instead of the old Boundary interface to describe curved boundaries
  and domains.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/01/15)
  </li>

  <li> New: The build system now queries for git branch name and
  revision sha1 (and automatically reconfigures if necessary). This
  information is used to annotate summary.log and detailed.log with the
  current revision sha1. Further, a header file <deal.II/base/revision.h>
  is now available that exports the macros: DEAL_II_GIT_BRANCH,
  DEAL_II_GIT_REVISION, DEAL_II_GIT_REVISION_SHORT.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/02)
  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Fixed: MappingQEulerian would previously not move interior points
  in 1D for higher order mappings. This has been fixed by removing a few
  specializations of MappingQ for 1D that are no longer necessary.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/02/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The implementation of the class GrowingVectorMemory has been
  moved from source/lac/vector_memory.cc to the new file
  include/deal.II/lac/vector_memory.templates.h. This allows users to
  create instantiations of GrowingVectorMemory for their own vector classes
  in case they intend to use them for the deal.II solvers.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/02/18)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: All members of MultithreadInfo are now static so it is no
  longer necessary to use the global instance multithread_info (now
  deprecated) or create your own instance (which does not work correctly
  anyway).
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/02/13)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: There was a bug in the energy source term of step-33 whereby
  the term was erroneously multiplied by the density. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Praveen C, Lei Qiao, 2015/02/13)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: If you take the product of a Tensor and a scalar number,
  you previously got a Tensor back that stored its elements in the same
  data type as the original tensor. This leads to problems if you
  multiply a <code>Tensor@<1,dim,double@></code> by a
  <code>std::complex@<double@></code> because the result clearly needs
  to store its elements as complex numbers, rather than as double
  variables. This is now changed: The result of the product of a Tensor
  and a scalar number is now a Tensor that stores its elements in a data
  type appropriate for this product. The same approach is taken for the
  SymmetricTensor class.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a new class ProductType that can be used
  to infer the type of the product of two objects. There is now also
  a class EnableIfScalar that helps restrict some templates to only
  cases where a type is a scalar.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/04)
  </li>

  <li> New: The Tensor classes now have copy constructors and copy
  operators that allow assignment from other tensors with different
  underlying scalar types.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/02/03)
  </li>

  <li> New: Class hp::DoFHandler can now also be serialized.
  <br>
  (Lukas Korous, 2015/01/31)
  </li>

  <li> Bugfix: deal.II now correctly links against librt in case of bundled
  boost being used.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/27)
  </li>

  <li> New: A new macro <code>DEAL_II_QUERY_GIT_INFORMATION</code> is
  provided to query user projects for git repository information simmilarly
  to those exported by deal.II.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/21)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: FEFaceValues and FESubfaceValues did not fill the
  jacobians and inverse jacobians if requested via the update flags.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/01/23)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: ParameterHandler::read_input() now checks that
  'subsection'/'end' are balanced in the input.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/01/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: In 3d, when you set the <code>colorize</code> flag of
  GridGenerator::hyper_shell(), the faces of the domain were colored but
  the edges were not. This was an oversight because to refine correctly,
  the edges also have to have the appropriate boundary indicator set.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/01/16)
  </li>

  <li> New: dealii::multithread_info.n_cpus returns the correct number of CPU 
  on FreeBSD.
  <br>
  (Bruno Turcksin, 2015/01/14)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: MPI collective operations such as MPI::sum, MPI::max now
  check for job_supports_mpi() internally, which allows running them also
  without a call to MPI_Init.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The method job_supports_mpi() now resides in the namespace
  Utilities::MPI instead of Utilities::System for consistency with other MPI
  methods. The old method has been marked deprecated and will be removed in
  a future version.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The update of ghost values in parallel::distributed::Vector when
  calling the assignment operator is now active when one of the two vector had
  its ghost values updated before or when the layout of the right hand side
  vector is one-to-one, more consistent with parallel PETSc and Trilinos
  vectors.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: PETScWrappers::MPI::SparseMatrix::reinit(other) copies
  the layout of another matrix. TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix
  operator= and copy constructor are now disabled. This brings
  functionality between PETSc and Trilinos in line.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: Triangulation::set_all_manifold_ids() and
  Triangulation::set_all_manifold_ids_on_boundaries()
  set all manifold ids on every object or on every
  boundary object respectively.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: GridTools::copy_boundary_to_manifold_id() and
  GridTools::copy_material_to_manifold_id() copy
  boundary_ids and material_ids to manifold_ids for
  faces on the boundary and for cells respectively.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/01/09)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Utilities::int_to_string() produced wrong results if
  the number of digits specified was ten or greater.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/01/08)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: VectorTools::interpolate_to_different_mesh() was accidentally
  only instantiated for dealii::Vector arguments, rather than all vector
  classes. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Benjamin Brands, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/12/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Use CASROOT environment variable as additional hint for
  opencasacade.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/12/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Update the run_testsuite.cmake script to also pick up
  muparser and opencascade configuration.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/12/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Update several places in the documentation that were not
  updated from functionparser to muparser. Add several forgotten
  DEAL_II_WITH_* variables to certain places in the documentation.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/12/29)
