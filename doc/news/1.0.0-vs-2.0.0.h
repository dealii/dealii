<h2>New multithreading scheme</h2>

<p>
After the old scheme to implement multithreading in
deal.II has proven to be too difficult, we
implemented something that is significantly more complex, but at the
same time significantly simpler to use. There is also a report on this
subject, explaining why's and how's, which can be accessed from the
<a href="../../documentation.html" target="body">documentation</a>
page.
