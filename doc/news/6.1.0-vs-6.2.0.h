<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The implementation of the reordering algorithms in the boost
  namespace created multiple edges between two nodes. The new implementation
  submits not more than one edge, but that affects the ordering of the
  degrees of freedom and deviates from previous behavior.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/04/22)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The files implementing the class ConstraintMatrix are now
  saved in the lac/ subdirectory, named <code>constraint_matrix.h</code>
  and included by the line <code>\#include
  @<lac/constraint_matrix.h@></code>. After all, constraints are just
  algebraic objects and do not depend on anything in the deal.II
  directory (in particular, they are dimension-independent).  The old
  <code>\#include @<dofs/dof_constraints.h@></code> include line is still
  enabled by a reference to the new file, but users should try to adapt
  their codes to the new file names as the reference might be removed in
  the future.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/03/04)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The function DoFTools::get_subdomain_association function used
  to assign degrees of freedom to the subdomain of the last cell on which
  the degree of freedom is a part. This introduced a bias for degrees of
  freedom's subdomains located on boundaries of subdomains, and
  consequently to unequal numbers of DoFs per subdomain even if the
  number of cells is roughly equal across subdomains. This behavior has
  been changed by assigning degrees of freedom pseudo-randomly to any of
  the subdomains on which they are located. This is a deviation from
  previous behavior, however.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, WB 2008/11/02)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The way we set up threads in the Threads::spawn functions
  and friends has been completely written, using the boost::bind and
  boost::function libraries. This has made things significantly simpler
  and allowed us to remove some 4,100 lines of code. The only
  user-visible side effect is that you can now no longer spawn
  functions with 10 arguments (this was the maximum before) whereas 9
  arguments continues to work; the reason for this is a limitation in
  the boost::bind library. This limit will be lifted with the next
  C++ standard, however, using variadic templates.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/10)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The SolutionTransfer class used to take a type as second
  template argument that denoted the scalar upon which Vector objects
  were built, in order to allow interpolating Vector@<float@> objects,
  for example. This argument has now been changed to a vector type,
  and been given a default of Vector@<double@>; however, one can
  now also pass in BlockVector objects, or objects of type
  PETScWrappers::Vector, etc. On the downside, the old
  SolutionTransfer::refine_interpolate function with only a single
  argument has been deleted since there is no reliable way to resize
  a vector unless it is a plain Vector@<double@>.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The FiniteElement::get_prolongation_matrix and
  FiniteElement::get_restriction_matrix functions now have an
  additional argument of type RefinementCase to enable a
  meaningful use of these matrices in case of anisotropic
  refinement. These matrices are used for solution transfer and
  multigrid operations, but there should be no need to use them
  in user codes directly. Note, that the matrices are not fully
  implemented for all finite elements up to now.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/07/04)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: <code>GeometryInfo::children_per_cell</code> has been
  replaced by GeometryInfo::max_children_per_cell, which
  represents the maximum number of children a cell might have,
  i.e. the number of children in the case of isotropic
  refinement. But note, that this number will rarely be needed in
  user codes. In general, the number of children of a cell varies
  from cell to cell and can be obtained by
  <code>cell->n_children()</code>, which gives the number of
  children of a specific <code>cell</code> which is refined iso-
  or anisotropically.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The analogous change applies to the number of children
  of a face. <code>GeometryInfo::subfaces_per_face</code> has
  been replaced by GeometryInfo::max_children_per_face, which
  represents the maximum number of children a face might have,
  i.e. the number of children in the case of an isotropic refined
  face.  But note, that this number will rarely be needed in user
  codes. In general, the number of children of a face varies from
  face to face and can be obtained by
  <code>face->n_children()</code>, which gives the number of
  children of a specific <code>face</code> which is refined iso-
  or anisotropically.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The GeometryInfo::child_cell_on_face function is
  generalized to anisotropic refinement and has now an additional
  RefinementCase argument. This function will rarely be used in
  user codes, as e.g. the neighbor's child at a specific face and
  subface should be accessed through
  <code>cell->neighbor_child_on_subface</code> rather than
  through the GeometryInfo::child_cell_on_face function.

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The step-22 tutorial program now uses some
  advanced features of the ConstraintMatrix such as imhomogeneities
  for implementing Dirichlet boundary condition and condensation of
  constraints on the fly.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/04/20)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a program, contributed by Jean-Paul Pelteret, that can
  convert Cubit generated meshes into UCD format that the GridIn class can
  read. The program along with a description is in the contrib/mesh_conversion
  directory.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret 2009/04/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: Configure mechanism and a few PETSc functions in the lac directory
  have been upgraded to support migration to PETSc version >=3.0.0 in anaology
  to the existing interface.
  <br>
  (Toby D. Young 2009/03/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: A new tutorial program  step-34 was added to the
  library that shows the usage of the new codimension one functionality
  recently added to the library. In this tutorial we show the use of
  boundary element methods on piecewise constant functions defined over
  a surface, and we solve the irrotational flow problem, or exterior
  Neumann Laplace problem.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2009/03/10)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: When linking with both Trilinos and BLAS, the BLAS libraries appeared
  first on the command line; however, if the Trilinos libraries required BLAS
  then this was the wrong order. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/02/11)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The subversion repository for deal.II development is now
  located on commercially hosted space at <a
  href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/">http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/</a>.
  <br>
  (GK 2009/01/20)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: Some parts of the library used to use classes and functions
  from the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">BOOST</a> library. Since
  many of the components of BOOST have been voted into what will be the
  next C++ standard, we now use a namespace std_cxx1x (coined on the
  provisional name C++0x used for the next C++ standard) into which we
  import BOOST components as necessary. If a compiler supports C++0x,
  we can then later replace BOOST components by elements from namespace
  <code>std</code> in one central place, rather than all throughout the
  code.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/01/12)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The step-33 tutorial program now uses the
  Trilinos wrapper
  classes for accessing Trilinos linear algebra routines instead of
  implementing that by hand.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/01/07)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">BOOST</a>
  library that is in the <code>contrib/</code> directory and is used in
  various places of the library has been upgraded to 1.37.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/07)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Based on work by Cataldo Manigrasso and Luca Heltai
  developed over the last few months on a branch, deal.II now
  supports meshes that are embedded in higher space
  dimensions. This allows, for example, to solve equations on
  the surface of a sphere (e.g. to use boundary element
  methods for exterior problems).
  <br>
  In practice, this is implemented by giving a large number
  of classes a second template argument. Whereas the first one,
  typically named <code>dim</code> still denotes the dimensionality
  of the triangulation (e.g. <code>dim=2</code> for triangulations
  of quadrilaterals, or <code>dim=3</code> for those made
  up of hexahedra), the second template argument <code>spacedim</code>
  denotes the dimensionality of the space this all is embedded in.
  As a consequence, if one wants to have a triangulation of a
  two-dimensional manifold in three-dimensional space, one would
  use <code>dim=2, spacedim=3</code> as template arguments.
  <br>
  In order to remain backward compatible, the new second template
  argument always has a default value that equals <code>dim</code>
  meaning it is still sufficient to write <code>Triangulation@<2@></code>
  if you intend two-dimensional triangulations of two-dimensional
  domains.
  <br>
  The new functionality is described in the step-34
  tutorial program.
  <br>
  (Cataldo Manigrasso, Luca Heltai 2008/12/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The various accessor classes have been rewritten entirely.
  Where previously we had these accessor classes as separate
  specializations for 1d, 2d, and 3d, each implementing the same
  set of functions, these classes have now all been merged into
  common templates TriaAccessor, DoFAccessor, and MGDoFAccessor,
  along with the existing CellAccessor, DoFCellAccessor and
  MGDoFCellAccessor. As a result, the documentation of individual
  functions should now be much easier to find.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: In analogy to the existing interfaces to the PETSc library, there
  are now also interfaces to much of the linear algebra part of the
  Trilinos library.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/12/01)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The deal.II configure script now autodetects SLEPc, an eigenvalue
  solver. Currently on SLEPc versions >=3.0.0 are supported.
  <br>
  (Toby D. Young 2008/11/27)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: A new  tutorial program, step-31, is contributed by
  Martin Kronbichler and Wolfgang Bangerth and shows the
  solution of the Boussinesq approximation to thermally driven
  convection in an incompressible fluid.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/11/14)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: In the step-22 tutorial program the generation of
  the sparsity pattern using the class BlockCompressedSetSparsityPattern has
  been replaced by a pattern of the class BlockCompressedSimpleSparsityPattern,
  which uses far less memory and is slightly faster.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, WB 2008/11/12)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The shared libraries we create are now versioned, i.e. they have
  the form <code>libdeal_II_2d.g.so.6.2.0</code>. The library without
  the version number is simply a link to the versioned library name.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/07)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">BOOST</a>
  library that is in the <code>contrib/</code> directory and is used in
  various places of the library has been upgraded to 1.36.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/09/19)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: In the step-23 tutorial program the terms corresponding
  to the external force were computed incorrectly. The error wasn't visible
  right away since in the program the right hand side is assumed to be zero.
  This has now been fixed.
  <br>
  (Johan Lorentzon, WB 2008/09/12)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: A new  tutorial program, step-28, is contributed by
  Yaqi Wang. It illustrates the solution
  of a coupled system of diffusion equations relevant to
  nuclear reactor physics where we use different meshes for
  different components of a vector-valued solution.
  <br>
  (Yaqi Wang 2008/09/10)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Contributed by Tobias Leicht as well as Ralf Hartmann, deal.II
  now supports anisotropic refinement of meshes. This functionality
  is explained in the step-30 tutorial program.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH 2008/07/08)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: In the new step-33 tutorial program there was
  a place where we incorrectly passed the diameter of a cell, rather
  than a face, to a function. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Chih-Che Chueh, WB 2008/06/28)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The new step-33 tutorial program had a place where
  we didn't release some memory. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Chih-Che Chueh, WB 2008/06/02)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: A missing include file prevented the <code>./configure</code> script
  from detecting the presence of the demangler with recent versions of the
  gcc compiler. The result is that backtraces after failed assertions only
  show the mangles function names, not their plain text equivalent. This is
  now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/05/27)
  </p>
  </li>

<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new QGaussOneOverR class, that allows for integration
  on the two dimensional reference element of arbitrary polynomial functions
  with weight 1/R. This class is only instantiated for dim=2, and it is intended
  for use with collocation type boundary element methods of order 1, where the
  singularities are collocated on the vertices of the quadrilaterals.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2009/03/11)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new QGaussLogR class, that generalizes the QGaussLog class to
  allow for arbitrary location of singularities, and singularity factors.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2009/03/11)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The FunctionParser class now supports the fparser library's interface to use
  units (like cm, or km) in expressions. An example is given in the documentation of
  that class.
  <br>
  (Victor Prosolin 2009/03/01)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The classes Threads::ThreadMutex and Threads::ThreadCondition have
  been renamed Threads::Mutex and Threads::ConditionVariable. The old names
  were somewhat redundant but have been retained as typedefs for compatibility.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/01/14)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a class TimerOutput that allows to neatly measure computing
  times in different sections of a program and write that information to screen.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/01/12)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The Timer class can now also return the wall time using the method
  Timer::wall_time(), as opposed to the CPU time returned by
  Timer::operator ().
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/01/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The new class types_are_equal allows to write some templates more
  efficient by allowing to figure out whether certain template types are,
  for example, equal to double or float (in which case we can use
  BLAS functions, or could do something else special).
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The Utilities::reverse_permutation and Utilities::invert_permutation
  compute the reverse and inverse of a given permutation of indices.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The PolynomialsRaviartThomas class had a bug that led to random
  results when used from multiple threads. As a consequence the FE_RaviartThomas
  class was unusable in a multithreaded context. This has now been fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is a new function scalar_product(const Tensor<2,dim> &,
  const Tensor<2,dim> &) that computes the scalar product
  $a:b=\sum_{i,j} a_{ij}b_{ij}$ between two tensors of rank 2.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: If the compiler allows to do <code>\#include @<mpi.h@></code>, then
  the preprocessor flag <code>DEAL_II_COMPILER_SUPPORTS_MPI</code> is now set in
  <code>base/include/base/config.h</code>. This also fixes a problem in
  <code>base/include/base/utilities.h</code> if a compiler capable of
  including <code>mpi.h</code> was used but not PETSc.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: A misplaced <code>\#include</code> directive prevented the file
  <code>base/source/data_out_base.cc</code> from being compilable by
  the PGI C++ compiler. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There are now a new
  GeometryInfo::min_cell_refinement_case_for_face_refinement
  (resp. GeometryInfo::min_cell_refinement_case_for_line_refinement)
  function which returns the RefinementCase representing the
  smallest refinement case of a cell for a given refinement of
  one of its faces (resp. lines). In 2D for example a cell has to
  be refined at least with RefinementCase::cut_y if the left line
  (line 0) shall be refined. Another refinement possibility for
  the cell would be <code>RefinementCase::cut_xy</code>, but that
  is not the minimal case.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new GeometryInfo::line_refinement_case
  function which returns the RefinementCase representing the
  refinement case of a line for a given refinement case of the
  corresponding cell.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The new
  <tt>GeometryInfo::n_children(refinement_case)</tt>
  function returns the number of children a cell/face has when
  refined with the RefinementCase <tt>refinement_case</tt>.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/11/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Given a RefinementCase of a cell the new
  GeometryInfo::face_refinement_case function returns the
  RefinementCase of a face.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/11/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new RefinementCase
  GeometryInfo::isotropic_refinement representing the isotropic
  refinement case in <code>dim</code> dimensions,
  i.e. GeometryInfo<1>::isotropic_refinement = RefinementCase::cut_x,
  GeometryInfo<2>::isotropic_refinement = RefinementCase::cut_xy
  and
  GeometryInfo<3>::isotropic_refinement = RefinementCase::cut_xyz.

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The SparseMatrix::precondition_SSOR function was implemented
  inefficiently. The new implementation uses about half the instruction
  count and reduces execution times on typical applications by ten to
  thirty percent.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/04/21)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The SparseILU::vmult kernel has been re-written to use similar
  data structures as SparseMatrix::vmult, which reduces the count of
  operations by one third and the execution times on typical applications
  by ten to twenty percent.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/04/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new class VectorView<Number> that allows views of
  arbitrary areas of memory to be seen as a Vector<Number>, simplifying
  a lot of works for portability issues between different libraries, and
  allowing for subviews of Vector<Number> classes without the need to
  copy back and forth large chunk of memories.
  <br>
  To be used with EXTREME caution, and only when you know exactly what you
  are doing, and speed is a necessity.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2009/04/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The local_to_global functions in ConstraintMatrix got smarter,
  which accelerates sparsity pattern generation and makes writing into
  sparse matrices using distribute_local_to_global faster.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/03/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The FullMatrix::swap_row and FullMatrix::swap_col functions
  had bugs that made them only work in case the matrix was square.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/03/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Added a few simple helper functions (to VectorBase) that allow
  some manipulation of PETSc vectors. These functions do what they say
  in the documentation.
  <br>
  (Toby D. Young 2009/01/08)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a class TrilinosWrappers::SparsityPattern that allows to
  construct distributed sparsity patterns that can be used for initializing
  Trilinos sparse matrices. This means that for large problems on several
  MPI processors the memory requirements are reduced and the initialization
  speed is increased.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/12/29)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: All SparseMatrix classes (SparseMatrix<number>, PETSc sparse
  matrices, Trilinos sparse matrices, block sparse matrices) can now
  directly add and set a FullMatrix and some other arrays into their value
  list. This is faster and more convenient than an element-by-element
  addition/set.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/11/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The class LAPACKFullMatrix can now invert full matrices using
  the (optimized) LAPACK functions getrf and getri. The speedup over
  the FullMatrix::gauss_jordan() function is a factor of two for matrices
  with 100 rows and columns, and grows with matrix size.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/11/11)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The BlockMatrixBase::clear() function that is used by all other
  block matrix type classes had a memory leak in that the memory
  allocated by all sub-objects was not freed. This is now fixed.

  New: The function SparsityTools::reorder_Cuthill_McKee reorders
  the nodes of a graph based on their connectivity to other nodes.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The function GridTools::get_face_connectivity_of_cells produces a
  sparsity pattern that describes the connectivity of cells of a
  triangulation based on whether they share common faces.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The function SparsityPattern::partition has been deprecated. It
  is now available in a new namespace SparsityTools that collects algorithms
  that work on sparsity patterns or connectivity graphs.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: Whereas the Vector class copy operator resized the left hand side
  operand whenever necessary, the corresponding operator of the BlockVector
  class did not. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Christian Cornelssen, WB 2008/10/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The SparseDirectUMFPACK class now calls the umfpack_dl_* routines
  instead of umfpack_di_*. On machines with 64-bit longs this allows the
  UMFPACK solver to allocate more than 2GB of memory for large problems.
  <br>
  (Moritz Allmaras 2008/10/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The SparseILU::initialize function, for some reason, required
  the second argument, SparseILU::AdditionalParameters, to be present even
  if it is a default constructed object. This argument now has a default value
  that equates to a default constructed object that can therefore be omitted
  when so desired.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/09/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Added the CompressedSimpleSparsityPattern as an alternative to
  CompressedSparsityPattern and CompressedSetSparsityPattern, which
  should be faster in most cases but its memory usage is somewhere
  in between.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister 2008/09/03)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The CompressedSparsityPattern can now elide some operations
  upon entering entries that may have been added before already.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, WB 2008/08/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: There are now functions CompressedSparsityPattern::print and
  CompressedSetSparsityPattern::print, in analogy
  to SparsityPattern::print .
  <br>
  (WB 2008/07/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The FullMatrix::copy_from(FullMatrix,bool) function had a bug
  that resulted in an exception being triggered whenever the given matrix
  had rows where the diagonal element is zero and the second parameter
  to the function was set to <code>true</code>. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/07/30)
  </p>


  <li> New: Added two new functions to calculate the left or the right inverse of a given
  rectangular matrix (FullMatrix::left_invert, FullMatrix::right_invert).
  They throw an exception if the matrices are not invertible.
  <br>
  (Cataldo Manigrasso 2008/6/12)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: FullMatrix::Tadd can now transpose correctly rectangular
  matrices, there was a mismatch about the indexes in the code.

  <p>
  Fixed: VectorTools::integrate_difference now works also on codimension one grids.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2009/04/10)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The ConstraintMatrix class can now also handle inhomogeneous
  constraints. This means that e.g. Dirichlet boundary conditions are now a
  special case of algebraic constraints. There are new condense functions
  that simultaneously act on matrices and vectors for use of this feature.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/02/25)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The DoFTools::count_dofs_per_component and
  DoFTools::count_dofs_per_block erroneously resized the output argument
  to the number of components or blocks in the finite element, respectively,
  even if the target component/block list given as an additional argument
  needed a different number of output elements. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/02/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The GridGenerator::half_hyper_shell function now also exists in 3d.
  However, to use it with the HalfHyperShellBoundary class, one has to
  pass inner and outer radii to the constructor.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, WB, 2009/01/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The restriction and embedding matrices for FE_Q are now implemented.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH, 2008/12/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The GeometryInfo::cell_to_child_coordinates and
  GeometryInfo::child_to_cell_coordinates functions are extended to
  anisotropic refinement.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH, 2008/12/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: There were cases with both anisotropic refinement and non-standard
  line orientation where we created wrong meshes in 3d. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH, 2008/12/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The FEValuesExtractors classes were not copyable though there
  are legitimate reasons to do so. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/17)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The MappingQEulerian function was not thread-safe. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The functions FETools::lexicographic_to_hierarchic_numbering and
  FETools::hierarchic_to_lexicographic_numbering now also exist in variants
  returning their result by value, rather than through their last argument.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: FEValues objects can now directly calculate the Laplacians of
  solution functions at quadrature points. This is equivalent to the
  trace of the Hessians, but faster and more convenient in user code.
  step-31 program has also been updated to use this.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/12/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The FEValuesViews objects that one gets when writing things
  like <code>fe_values[velocities]</code> have acquired the ability to
  extract individual components of solutions at quadrature points by
  writing code like
  <code>fe_values[velocities].get_function_values (global_solution,
  local_velocity_values)</code>. See the new section at the end of the
  @ref vector_valued module for an overview of this facility. The
  step-31 program has also been updated to use this.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The FEValuesViews objects that one gets when writing things
  like <code>fe_values[velocities]</code> (see @ref vector_valued) have
  become a lot smarter. They now compute a significant amount of data
  at creation time, rather than on the fly. This means that creating such
  objects becomes more expensive but using them is cheaper. To offset this
  cost, FEValuesBase objects now create all possible FEValuesViews objects
  at creation time, rather than whenever you do things like
  <code>fe_values[velocities]</code>, and simply return a reference to a
  pre-generated object. This turns an $O(N)$ effort into an $O(1)$
  effort, where $N$ is the number of cells.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/10)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Upgraded: The FunctionParser classes now use version 2.83 of the fparser
  library.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2008/12/08)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The GridGenerator::laplace_transform would only do at most 1000
  iterations in its solver, irrespective of the actual number of nodes to
  be moved around. This is now fixed: the maximum number now equals the
  number of nodes.
  <br>
  (Luca D'Auria 2008/12/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The function DoFTools::make_zero_boundary_constraints() computes the
  constraints that result from requiring the degrees of freedom at the
  boundary to be zero. Use cases are when the sparsity pattern is not known
  / not wanted / not inaccessible.
  <br>
  (Toby D. Young 2008/12/04)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The function ConstraintMatrix::distribute_local_to_global() for
  matrices does now use row-wise addition into sparse matrices, which
  accelerates the transfer from local to global data.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, WB 2008/11/27)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values function was implemented a bit
  clumsily and was using much more time than necessary. This should be fixed now.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/11/25)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The GridIn::read_msh function had a bug that made it reject
  MSH input files if they contained type-15 cells with more than one
  associated vertex.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/11/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The DoFRenumbering::Cuthill_McKee algorithm had a bug when applied
  to MGDoFHandler objects and if the <code>reverse</code> flag was set. This
  should now be fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values() also for PETScWrappers::MPI::BlockSparseMatrix.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister 2008/10/27)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: When calling function DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern with a ConstraintMatrix, it is now possible to set a bool argument keep_constrained_dofs. When this flag is set to false, constrained rows and columns will not be part of the sparsity pattern, which increases the performance of matrix operations and decrease memory consumption in case there are many constraints.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/10/21)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a second DoFTools::count_dofs_with_subdomain_association function that
  calculates the number of degrees of freedom associated with a certain subdomain and
  splits the result up according to the vector component of each degree of freedom. This
  function is needed when splitting block matrices in parallel computations.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The GridOut::write_gnuplot function had a bug that made it output only the
  very first cell. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/09)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The GridIn::read_msh function can now read version 2 of the MSH format described
  <a target="_top" href="http://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html">here</a>.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: In rare cases, when Triangulation::limit_level_difference_at_vertices
  is passed to the constructor of the Triangulation class, meshes could be
  generated that do not honor this flag. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/06)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The class FE_Q can now alternatively be constructed based on
  support points from a given one-dimensional quadrature rule.
  <br>
  (Katharina Kormann, Martin Kronbichler, 2008/09/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: Using the ConstraintMatrix class, when a degree of freedom was
  constrained against another DoF, and that other DoF was constrained to
  be equal to zero (i.e. the trivial linear combination of a third set of
  degrees of freedom), an exception resulted. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: It is now possible to get the inverse of the Jacobian
  matrix from the transformation form the real to the unit cell by
  using FEValues::inverse_jacobian.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/08/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is a second GridTools::partition_triangulation
  function that takes a cell connectivity pattern as argument, rather
  than computing it itself as the existing function. Use cases are
  discussed in the documentation of the new function.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/06)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: GridTools::find_cells_adjacent_to_vertex had a bug that
  prevented its correct functioning in three dimensions. Some
  cases were left out due to incorrect assumptions on the various
  refinement possibilities.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2008/07/17)
  </p>

  <p>
  New: There is now a new
  Triangulation::prevent_distorted_boundary_cells function which is
  only useful in case of anisotropic refinement. At the boundary
  of the domain, the new point on the face may be far inside the
  current cell, if the boundary has a strong curvature. If we
  allow anistropic refinement here, the resulting cell may be
  strongly distorted, especially if it is refined again later
  on. To prevent this problem, this function flags such cells for
  isotropic refinement. It is called automatically from
  Triangulation::prepare_coarsening_and_refinement. Therefore
  this should have no effect on user codes.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/08/02)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new Triangulation::create_children function
  which actually sets up the children of a cell and updates the
  neighbor information. This work has been done in
  Triangulation::execute_refinement so far. Memory allocation has
  to be done prior to the function call. However, this is really
  something internal to the library and there should never be the
  need to use this function in user_codes. Calling
  Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement will be all
  you need.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/29)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: A part of the functionality of Triangulation::execute_coarsening has been implemented in a new way
  and shifted to the new function Triangulation::coarsening_allowed. This function decides,
  depending on the refinement situation of all a cells neighbors, if the
  cell may be coarsened, in which case the bool value <code>true</code> is
  returned. This is a functionality which is partly dimension dependent.
  <br>
  However, there should never be any reason to use this function in user codes.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new CellAccessor::neighbor_is_coarser function,
  which returns a bool value <code>true</code>, if the requested
  neighbor is a coarser one and <code>false</code> if the
  neighbor is as refined as the current cell. This new
  functionality is needed in the internals of the library to
  decide, if <code>neighbor_of_neighbor</code> or
  <code>neighbor_of_coarser_neighbor</code> has to be
  called. This decision is trivial in case of isotropic
  refinement, where the level of the cell and its neighbor is all
  the information needed. In case of aniostropic refinement, this
  new function can be used.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new
  <code>Triangulation::MeshSmoothing::allow_anisotropic_smoothing</code>
  smoothing flag for triangulations. An important part of the
  smoothing process for refinement and coarsen flags is to
  ensure, that no double refinement takes places at any face. If
  a cell is refined twice, its neighbor has to be refined at
  least once. However, technically it is not always necessary to
  refine the neighbor isotropically, it may be sufficient to
  choose only one direction for the refinement. While this allows
  to reduce the number of newly created cells to a minimum, it is
  incompatible with older versions of the library, as anisotropic
  refinement takes place, even if all the explicitly set
  refinement flags ask for isotropic refinement.
  <br>
  Therefore this functionality is off by default. However, in order to use
  the new feature of anisotropic refinement to full extend, this flag should
  be set explicitly.
  <br>
  Note, that for reasons of backwards compatibility this flag is
  NOT included in the general <code>MeshSmoothing::maximum_smoothing</code>
  flag.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new
  TriaObjectAccessor::clear_refinement_case function.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/12/19)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Extended: The CellAccessor::neighbor_of_neighbor function is
  now extended to anisotropic refinement.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/12/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Extended (internal): Lines on <code>level>0</code> have always
  been stored pairwise. In order to allow the creation of single
  interior lines we now also allow storage of single lines. The
  <tt>TriangulationLevel<1>::reserve_space</tt> function
  now takes an additional <code>n_consecutive_lines</code>
  parameter which allows to create new single as well as pairs
  for lines <code>n_consecutive_lines=1</code> or
  <code>n_consecutive_lines=2</code>, respectively.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/12/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: When allowing anisotropic refinement it cannot be
  guaranteed that all children of a cell are stored in
  consecutive components of the TriaLevel::cells vector,
  respectively. It is only known that children are stored at
  least in pairs. Therefore, it is not sufficient any more to
  store the index of the first child of a cell, only. Now the
  indices of every second child, i.e. of the even numbered
  children, must be stored.  For this, the
  TriaObjectAccessor::set_children function for cells now has a
  new argument representing the number of the child for which the
  index shall be set. This function can only be called for even
  numbered children. The same applies to the respective function
  for faces.
  <br>
  Finally, we note that these functions are for internal use,
  only.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/03/03)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The CellAccessor::refine_flag_set function now returns
  a RefinementCase argument instead of a boolean. Be aware, that
  you now still can ask <code>if(!cell->refine_flag_set())</code>
  , <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set()==false)</code> and
  <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set())</code> , but you cannot ask
  <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set()==true)</code> any more.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/03/03)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Extended: The CellAccessor::set_refine_flag function now has a
  new RefinementCase argument which defaults to
  <tt>GeometryInfo<dim>::isotropic_refinement</tt>.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/03/03)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new class RefinementCase defined in
  <code>geometry_info.h</code>, which allows to describe all
  possible (anisotropic and isotropic) refinement cases in (1,) 2
  and 3 dimensions.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new TriaObjectAccessor::n_children function
  which returns the number of children of the cell or face it was
  invoked for.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new TriaObjectAccessor::refinement_case
  function which returns the RefinementCase a cell or face is
  refined with.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New (for internal use only): There is now a new
  TriaObjectAccessor::set_refinement_case function. This function
  is mainly for internal use (required by
  Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement). It is not
  provided for <code>dim=1</code> as there the refinement case
  defaults to isotropic refinement.
  <br>
  Note, that users should still use the
  CellAccessor::set_refine_flag function for setting the
  RefinementCase of cells to be refined within the next
  Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement function.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: New <code>vector@<RefinementCase@> refinement_cases</code>
  vectors have been introduced in TriaObjects. For memory
  efficiency (but with a penalty on run-time) they might be
  replaced by <code>vector@<vector@<bool@> @> (dim, vector@<bool@>
  (n_quads/n_hexes))</code>, later.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: When using a higher order mapping of degree at least 3 (i.e.
  the MappingQ class) on meshes that have cells with non-standard
  face orientation and that touch the boundary of the domain, then
  some interpolation points were wrongly computed.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, Timo Heister, WB 2008/06/10)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The ParameterHandler::get_integer function now throws an
  exception when called for non-integer parameters. This exception has
  been commented out some time ago but is now reincluded.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/06/11)
