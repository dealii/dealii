<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: In 3d, the function <code
       class="member">DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints</code>
       contained an assertion that failed erroneously for finite
       elements that do not have degrees of freedom on vertices. This
       is now fixed.

       (WB 2002/02/21)

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code>TriaAccessor<3,3>::measure</code>
