New: Each cell is assigned a globally unique active cell index and (if requested) 
a level cell index. These indices are integers enumerated contiguously within
each subdomain of the mesh.
Users can query locally-owned and ghost cells for their indices via CellAccessor::global_active_cell_index()
or CellAccessor::global_level_cell_index().
The value is managed automatically by the Triangulation classes.
Furthermore, triangulations deriving from parallel::TriangulationBase provide partitioners
for these indices, which can be used to set up ghosted vectors with one entry per
cell.
