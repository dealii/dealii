Deprecated: The FEValuesViews::Scalar, FEValuesViews::Vector,
FEValuesViews::Tensor, and FEValuesViews::SymmetricTensor classes all
have `OutputType` structures that defined the types of evaluating
the values and derivatives of finite element fields at quadrature
points. These structures have been deprecated, and the corresponding
types are now defined via local `using` declarations in the classes
mentioned above.
