Improved: Changes in namespace GridGenerator.
The original documentation of enclosed_hyper_cube said 'first two parameters' in the second line, which was a bit unclear. 
I made that more specific. The coloring scheme was also unclear, especially with the use of bitwise OR as a verb.
The moebius function had a pi outside of math mode, not a huge error.
