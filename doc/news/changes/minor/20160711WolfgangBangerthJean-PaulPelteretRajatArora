Fixed: FEValues::reinit() would sometimes try to be overly
clever and not re-compute information when called with the same
cell twice in a row, even if the underlying triangulation had
been moved, translated, stretched, or otherwise had its vertex
locations changed between the two calls to FEValues::reinit().
This is now fixed.
