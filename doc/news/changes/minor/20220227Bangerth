New: The template variable Utilities::MPI::mpi_type_id_for_type
provides information about the `MPI_Datatype` that corresponds to a
given type. This information is necessary in all MPI calls where one
needs to provide an `MPI_Datatype` to identify the kinds of objects
stored in a send or receive buffer.
