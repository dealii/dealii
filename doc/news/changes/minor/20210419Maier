Added: The MPI_InitFinalize RAII class has gained an
MPI_InitFinalize::signals::at_mpi_init and an
MPI_InitFinalize::signals::at_mpi_finalize signal that are triggered
immediately after initializing the MPI context with <code>MPI_Init</code>
and immediately before deinitializing the MPI context with
<code>MPI_Finalize</code>.
