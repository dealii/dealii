Fixed: There was a bug in 
Differentiation::AD::ScalarFunction::extract_hessian_component()
that was triggered when using a symmetric tensor extractor with a non-zero
first component index. Having previously lead to either incorrect results being
returned or valid user programs crashing, it has now been corrected.
