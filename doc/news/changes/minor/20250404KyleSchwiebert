New: FE_Simplex_Poly now implements FiniteElement::face_to_cell_index(),
enabling periodicity for derived classes, with restrictions similar to the
implementation in FE_Q_Base. Additionally,
GridGenerator::hyper_rectangle_with_simplicies() now accepts an additional
boolean argument which, in 3D, breaks each cubical cell into six tetrahedra
instead of five.  This mesh meets the restrictions of
FE_Simplex_Poly::face_to_cell_index().
