New: The policy under which things in deal.II are deprecated has changed.
Deprecated features are now first marked with DEAL_II_DEPRECATED_EARLY until the
next release of the library, at which point they will be remarked with
DEAL_II_DEPRECATED. By default, things marked with DEAL_II_DEPRECATED_EARLY do
not print deprecation warnings - this is controlled with the
DEAL_II_EARLY_DEPRECATIONS CMake configuration option. This change was made so
that users can use multiple recent checkouts of the development branch without
needing to address the problem that some will print deprecation warnings and
others do not, and also so that new deprecation warnings do not appear outside
of the release period.
