Improved: The parallel loops in the deal.II Vector class for
vector-vector operations have been revised for performance. This includes
adjusting the minimum parallel grain size to 4096 vector entries and using an
affinity partitioner provided by Threading Building Blocks for better data
locality, especially on multi-socket systems.
