Changed: The ParticleHandler class now provides references to the underlying
triangulation and mapping through member functions get_triangulation() and
get_mapping(). In addition, the member functions get_particle_positions(
VectorType &) and get_particle_positions(std::vector<Point<spacedim>> &) are
marked as const member functions, so that they can be called from const
ParticleHandler objects.
