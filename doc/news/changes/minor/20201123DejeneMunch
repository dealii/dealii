New: The function GridGenerator::convert_hypercube_to_simplex_mesh allows to
convert a given triangulation based on quadrilaterals (2D) or hexahedra (3D)
to a triangulation based on simplices or tetraedra, respectively. Thereby,
material_IDs and boundary_IDs are inherited from the given triangulation.
