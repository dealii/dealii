Improved: The initialization of the mapping part of MatrixFree for mappings of
type MappingQGeneric or derived classes has been made much faster. Apart from
a single query per cell for the geometry via the MappingQGeneric class, all
interpolations to metric terms at quadrature points are now done with
matrix-free routines using sum factorization, providing similar performance as
an operator evaluation.
