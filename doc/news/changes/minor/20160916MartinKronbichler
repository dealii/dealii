Improved: The multigrid V-cycle has been rewritten for performance on
large-scale machines. Rather than transferring parts of the defect
immediately to all coarser levels with a complexity of O(n_levels) global
communication steps per V-cycle, we now transfer the full defect once to the
next coarser level only, resulting in crossing all processors only once.
