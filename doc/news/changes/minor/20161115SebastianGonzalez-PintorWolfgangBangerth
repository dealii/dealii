Fixed: Calling MappingQ::clone() did not copy the
<code>use_mapping_q_on_all_cells</code> flag that this
mapping class gets passed to its constructor. This leads
to wrong results if you wanted to use curved cells on
interior cells and if such an object was used inside an
hp::MappingCollection, for example. There are, in addition,
several places in the library where one would pass a mapping,
and the library would clone it into a member of such a collection,
and these would also yield wrong results. An example is the use
of DataOut::build_patches with a mapping that had this flag set
upon construction.
