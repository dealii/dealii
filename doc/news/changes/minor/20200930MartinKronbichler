Improved: MappingQGeneric::transform_real_to_unit_cell() has been made much
faster by directly working with the tensor product form of the mapping shape
functions and avoiding many unnecessary memory allocations. The main cost is
now MappingQGeneric::compute_mapping_support_points(), which can be made fast
with MappingQCache, for example.
