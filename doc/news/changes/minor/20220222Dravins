Fixed: The function parallel::distributed::copy_triangulation() used to
copy the reference to the attached SolutionTransfer instance, which resulted
in calling the same SolutionTransfer instance multiple times if the 
triangulation and the new triangulation are refined/coarsened independently.
This has been fixed.
