New: There is now a new DoFTools::make_flux_sparsity_pattern()
which takes a constraint matrix and flux and internal dof masks, in
parallel. This is useful in the case where some components of a
finite element are continuous and some discontinuous, allowing
constraints to be imposed on the continuous part while also building
building the flux terms needed for the discontinuous part.
