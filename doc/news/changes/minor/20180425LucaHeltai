Fixed: MappingQEulerian uses an FEValues internally. This FEValues was initialized with the FiniteElement
obtained by DoFHandler::get_fe(). Unfortunately, the FiniteElement that is inside the DoFHandler is
not guaranteed to remain unaltered upon successive refinements, so we now make a new clone 
inside MappingQEulerian to guarantee that successive calls to DoFHandler::distribute_dofs don't 
trigger an exception.
