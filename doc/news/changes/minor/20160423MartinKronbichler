Fixed: TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector and TrilinosWrappers::Vector could
access invalid memory in the reinit() method if the MPI communicator was
deleted before termination of the program. This usually happened when using
vectors from GrowingVectorMemory where a pool keeps vector alive. This has
been fixed.
