New: The class VectorizedArray has gained two new access functions, gather and
scatter, that map to more efficient hardware versions on new architectures
(AVX2 or AVX-512). Furthermore, support for AVX-512 has been improved by
providing optimized vectorized_load_and_transpose() and
vectorized_transpose_and_store().
