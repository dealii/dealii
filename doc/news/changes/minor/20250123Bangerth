Deprecated: The functions ReferenceCell::unit_tangential_vectors() and
ReferenceCell::unit_normal_vectors() were poorly renamed, given the
plural (when they only returned a single vector) and the use of the
word "unit" when they return information about faces. As a
consequence, these functions have been renamed to
ReferenceCell::face_tangent_vector() and
ReferenceCell::face_normal_vector(), and the old names are now
deprecated.
