Changed: The vertex positions of GridGenerator::quarter_hyper_ball() have been
slightly changed. It concerns the points along the straight faces and in the
interior. The new positions have been determined to balance the sizes and
aspect ratios (expressed by the minimal and maximal singular values of the
Jacobian from reference to real coordinates), producting a slightly better
mesh quality.
