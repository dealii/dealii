Removed: The Threads::DummyMutex, Threads::DummyConditionVariable, and
Threads::DummyThreadBarrier classes have been removed. These were only
used if deal.II was compiled without thread support, in which case
certain functionality from the TBB was not available. But the
implementations of the underlying functionality is now unconditionally
available via the C++11 standard library, and so we don't need the
dummy implementations any more.
