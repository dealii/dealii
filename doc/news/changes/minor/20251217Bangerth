Changed: step-42 used to create output of the solid object in the
deformed configuration by deforming the mesh with the solution before
output, creating output in the deformed configuration, and then
undoing the mesh deformation. But we can do all of this without
deforming the mesh at all: The MappingQEulerian class can do that more
easily, and step-42 has been changed to use this approach now.
