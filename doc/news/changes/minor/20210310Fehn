New: MappingQCache has new initialize functions. One set of functions takes
either a std::function or a dealii::Function for transforming
individual points. Another set of functions take global vectors (and 
MGLevelObjects of global vectors) and use these to initialize the position of
the support points much like MappingFEField does.
