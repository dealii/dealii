New: The new method Differentiation::SD::BatchOptimizer::extract() allows one to
extract results from previous evaluation of the symbolic expressions. 
This means that one can safely use a single instance of a batch optimizer to
pre-compute a set of results, cache them, and then later extract some results
from the cached data without re-evaluating any symbolic expressions.
