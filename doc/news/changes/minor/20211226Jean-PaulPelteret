New: A symbolic expression can now be hashed using the
SD::Expression::compute_hash() function. The (cached) hash can then be retrieved
using the SD::Expression::get_hash() function. In some circumstances this can
aid comparing expressions without resorting to the more costly comparator
provided by SymEngine.
