Fixed: All deal.II classes now use virtual inheritance for the Subscriptor
class. This ensures that after inheriting from these classes only one
Subscriptor copy remains in the object. This in turn enables the use of a
SmartPointer with classes that inherit two or more deal.II classes that
inherited from Subscriptor.
