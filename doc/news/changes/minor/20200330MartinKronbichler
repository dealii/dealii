Fixed: FEValues would previously detect cell similarities when combined with
MappingFEField and MappingManifold when the underlying mesh had similarities,
even though the deformed cells did not. This would lead to wrong Jacobians and
transformed shape function gradients, among others, when running deal.II
without threads. This is now fixed.
