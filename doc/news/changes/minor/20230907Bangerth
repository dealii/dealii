Changed: IndexSet objects could only be compared for equality or
inequality against other IndexSet objects that had the same size. This
did not allow for comparison against default-constructed objects, for
example to test whether an object had been initialized. The
restriction is therefore relaxed: IndexSet objects can be compared for
equality and inequality against objects of the same size, or or size
zero.
