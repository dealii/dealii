Fixed: When checking whether a particle is in a specific cell,
ParticleHandler always assumed that the cell is a quadrilateral or
hexahedron. This is of course correct if the mesh only contains such
cells, but is wrong if you are working on simplex or mixed meshes and
sometimes led to putting particles into the wrong cells. This is now
fixed.
