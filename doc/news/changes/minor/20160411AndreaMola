New: Added New option in the read_ucd function of the GridIn class.
A flag can now be assigned to the function, to decide wether the
indicators specified in a UCD file should be interpreted as
boundary_ids or as manifold_ids. This is particularly useful
when the indicators refer to internal faces, for which
boundary_ids cannot be used.
