Changed: The TimerOutput class now reports CPU time spent in sections
as the sum over all processes in the given MPI communicator.
Previously, it would only report for each section the CPU time on the current
process. This meant the time spent in sections would not add up to the total
CPU time, which was always reported as the sum over all MPI processes.
