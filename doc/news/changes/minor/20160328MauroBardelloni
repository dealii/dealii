New: Add GridTools::remove_hanging_nodes() and
GridTools::remove_anisotropy() in GridTools. GridTools::remove_hanging_nodes()
detects cells with hanging nodes and refines the neighbours in the direction
that removes hanging nodes or in every directions.
GridTools::remove_anisotropy() refines a mesh until the resulting mesh is
composed by cells with ratio between the extension in each coordinate
direction lower than a fixed value.
