Fixed: TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix will now exit early if there are no
entries to add to the matrix. This usually occurs when zero elision is on. This
fixes a bug where the matrix raises an exception if there are no entries to add
to a matrix and the provided row and column values are not locally stored.
