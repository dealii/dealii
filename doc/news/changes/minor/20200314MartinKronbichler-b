Improved: The detection of compression in the mapping data structures of
MatrixFree has been made more general. It can now also detect when two cells
(not necessarily adjacent ones) are translations of each other, so that the
same set of Jacobians can be used on both. This helps the performance of
matrix-free operator evaluation in case the geometry fits into processor
caches and the operation is memory-bandwidth limited.
