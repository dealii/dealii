New: The function Particles::ParticleHandler::add_global_particles() now takes 
another optional argument, that allows one to set ids arbitrarily. Moreover,
now the numbering of the ids is correct also if we call the method more than
one time. Newly added particles, if ids are not specified, now correctly get
the first available ids. 
Added a new version of Particles::ParticleHandler::add_global_particles() that
takes a vector of Particles::Particle objects instead of just their positions.
This can be used in conjunction with the signal
Particles::ParticleHandler::Signals::particle_lost() to reinsert
Particles::Particle objects that went out of the locally owned and ghost cells.
