New: GridTools::Cache::get_locally_owned_cell_bounding_boxes_rtree() extracts
a tree of bounding boxes covering the locally owned cells of a triangulation.
This can be used in conjunction with GridTools::Cache::get_covering_rtree() to
make approximate geometrical queries on who owns what spatial region.
