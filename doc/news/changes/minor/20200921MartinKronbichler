New: The classes FEEvaluation and FEFaceEvaluation with template parameter -1
for the polynomial degree is now based on pre-compiled templated code for
polynomial degrees between 1 and 6. This allows for fast execution of
matrix-free evaluation for run-time polynomial degrees. The generated
instantiations are controlled by
`include/deal.II/matrix_free/evaluation_template_factory.templates.h` and can
be pre-compiled for additional degrees in user code.
