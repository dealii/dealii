Improved: DoFRenumbering::compute_Cuthill_McKee when used with
distributed triangulations contained parts that scaled as the global problem
size, rather than the processor-local size. This prevented its use with more
than a few hundred cores when hanging node constraints were activated. This
has been fixed.
