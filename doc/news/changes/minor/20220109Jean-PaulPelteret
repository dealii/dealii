New: MeshWorker::ScratchData and MeshWorker::CopyData now have hp-capabilities.
Creation of a ScratchData object with an hp::FECollection and hp::QCollection
enables those capabilities. A few specialized MeshWorker::ScratchData::reinit()
were added to support face integration where the integration rule and mapping
differs on either side of an interface. Additionally, some
MeshWorker::CopyData::reinit() methods have been implemented to cater for the
change in number of degrees-of-freedom between cells iterated over during
assembly.
