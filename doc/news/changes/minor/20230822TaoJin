New: Add two tensor functions for the split of a 2nd-order symmetric tensor
into a positive part and a negative part based on the signs of the eigenvalues
obtained from the spectrum decomposition. The function positive_negative_split()
performs the positive-negative split of the 2nd-order symmetric tensor given as
the input. The function positive_negative_projectors() not only performs the split,
but also provides the derivatives (two fourth-order tensors) of the positive/negative
part of the tensor with respect to the input tensor.
