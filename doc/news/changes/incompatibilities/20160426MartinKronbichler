Changed: deal.II used to create template instantiations for scalar
types <tt>double</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, and <tt>long double</tt>. Since
<tt>long double</tt> is rarely used and the additional precision does
usually not pay off because most of the other arithmetics in deal.II are
only done using <tt>double</tt> variables, it is not instantiated by default
any more. This reduces the library size by up to 20 percent. In case you
need instantiations of certain methods using <tt>long double</tt> data
structures and get linker errors stating undefined symbols involving
<tt>long double</tt>, include the respective <tt>.templates.h</tt> file(s)
with the code definitions. See the section on @ref Instantiations in the
manual for further information.
