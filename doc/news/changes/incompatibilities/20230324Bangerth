Removed: The BoundingBox class had a function `get_boundary_points()`
that returned a writable reference to internal data structures. While
the constructors enforced that the corner points of the bounding box
are indeed bottom left and top right (i.e., that for each coordinate
direction, the first corner point was less than or equal than the
second corner point), it was not possible to enforce this invariant
throughout the life of the object because users could set internal
variables to arbitrary values via the aforementioned function. The
function has consequently been removed; only the `const` version of
the function remains that returns a read-only reference.
