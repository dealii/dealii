Changed: The deal.II distributed vector classes do now derive from
LinearAlgebra::VectorSpaceVector and have been moved to the
LinearAlgebra::distributed namespace. In the definition of the new
interfaces, several old vector functions have been marked as deprecated. The
methods <tt>operator==</tt>, <tt>operator!=</tt>, and
<tt>is_non_negative</tt> have been removed from the new interface.
