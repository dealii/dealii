Patch to fix issue#7970 for 'RaviartThomas<3>(degree)' elements on meshes
that contain cells with faces that are flipped and/or not in standard
orientation. The patch provides a possible way to fix other FE classes inheriting
from 'FE_PolyTensor' but does not implement it yet. It does not change the interface
to FE classes.
