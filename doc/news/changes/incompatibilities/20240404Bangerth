Changed: Many functions in class Tensor and class SymmetricTensor were
made `constexpr` over the past couple of years, but this conflicts
with the desire to use vector intrinsics in these functions to
accelerate tensor operations. As a consequence, we have removed the
`constexpr` annotations again selectively where necessary.
