New: deal.II now requires at least BOOST version 1.56, rather than the
previous minimal version of 1.54. This is because 1.54 does not support
serializing objects of type std::unique_ptr if C++11 is used, but we now
use such objects in a variety of places in classes that can be serialized.
BOOST 1.56, on the other hand, supports this. deal.II bundles BOOST 1.62
for cases where no or no sufficiently new version of BOOST is found on
a system.
