Removed: Many of the linear solver classes used the
<code>deallog</code> object to output information about the progress
of the iteration. The same was true for the SolverControl class.
This has now been removed since the information was
not usually very useful, and is also available on demand using the
various member functions of class SolverControl as well as the signals
of the solver classes.
