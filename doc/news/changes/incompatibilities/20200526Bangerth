Removed: The Threads::Task class had an `operator==` that allowed
comparing objects of this type for equality. This operator has been
removed. If you want to store objects of this kind in a collection
that requires this kind of operator (say, `std::set`), then you
probably can't do so any more in a reasonable way. However, this is
exactly what the Threads::TaskGroup class is there for.
