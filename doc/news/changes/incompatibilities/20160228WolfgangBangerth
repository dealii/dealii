Removed: Functions with names containing <code>boundary_indicator</code>
have been removed. They had previously already been deprecated, and replaced
by functions containing the string <code>boundary_id</code> instead, to keep
with the style used for <code>material_id</code>, <code>subdomain_id</code>,
etc.
