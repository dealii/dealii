Fixed: GridOut::write_vtk output the vertices of hexahedra in the wrong order,
which resulted in visualization programs computing all cell volumes as negative.
Fixing this required that we significantly update the way VTK input is read in
to deal.II as well (so that GridOut composed with GridIn remains idempotent). As
a result, the order of cells, faces, and edges is now different for meshes read
from VTK files.
