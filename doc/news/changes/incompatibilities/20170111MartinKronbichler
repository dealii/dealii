Changed: The class FE_DGQ used to provide a protected constructor taking a
one-dimensional Quadrature argument. This has been changed in favor of a
constructor taking a vector of polynomials. To use the old constructor, you
can create a vector of polynomials by replacing the argument
<code>quadrature_1d</code> by
<code>Polynomials::generate_complete_Lagrange_basis(quadrature_1d.get_points())</code>. In
addition, the class FE_DGQArbitraryNodes that defines the public interface
taking a one-dimensional quadrature formula is unchanged, so only user codes
that derive directly from FE_DGQ should be affected.
