Changed: To be able to guarantee correctness of
the application of constraints in MatrixFree, we
require that users call AffineConstraints::close()
before calling MatrixFree::reinit() if AffineConstraints
objects are passed that are not empty. One can check
if an AffineConstraints object is closed with the
new function AffineConstraints::is_closed().
