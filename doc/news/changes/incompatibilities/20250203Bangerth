Changed: Every deal.II header file includes the deal.II header
`deal.II/base/config.h` that contains some basic configuration
information such as what deal.II version is being used, whether
deal.II was configured with Trilinos/PETSc/... support, etc. In turn,
`config.h` included `deal.II/base/types.h` and
`deal.II/base/numbers.h`, making the contents of these latter two
files available throughout deal.II.

For conceptual reasons, for example to support C++20 modules in the
long run, the `deal.II/base/config.h` file must stand separate from
the rest of the deal.II header files. As a consequence, it can no
longer have includes for other deal.II header files (namely,
`deal.II/base/types.h` and `deal.II/base/numbers.h` as mentioned
above), and no longer does so now. If your code requires knowledge of
the contents of `deal.II/base/types.h` and `deal.II/base/numbers.h`,
you will have to explicitly include these files like you do with any
other deal.II header file already.
