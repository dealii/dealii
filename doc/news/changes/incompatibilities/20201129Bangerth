Removed: The file `affine_constraints.h` had a class called
`IsBlockMatrix` that, however, also allowed to check whether its
template argument is in fact a block sparsity pattern. The class was
likely never intended to be in the public interface, and has been
moved to internal::AffineConstraints::IsBlockMatrix and now also
internal::AffineConstraints::IsBlockSparsityPattern.
