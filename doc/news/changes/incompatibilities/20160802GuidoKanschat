Changed: DoFTools::make_cell_patches() only accepts block lists of type
SparsityPattern. The reason is that it has to initialize the size of the
pattern on distributed triangulations by computing the number of locally
owned cells. Initialization differs between sparsity pattern classes, so no
generic function would be possible. On the other hand, the block list is an
object, which only extends over locally owned grid cells and its size can be
determined efficiently upon initialization. Therefore, SparsityPattern is a
good choice here.

At the same time, we changed the dof handler template to the type DoFHandler,
since hp::DoFHandler requires a different setup of the SparsityPattern.
