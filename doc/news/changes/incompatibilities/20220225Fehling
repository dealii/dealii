Changed: For weighted load balancing with parallel::distributed::Triangulation
objects, an intial weight of `1000` will no longer be assigned to each cell.
<br>
The old signal Triangulation::Signals::cell_weight has been deprecated.
Please use the new signal Triangulation::Signals::weight instead.
<br>
You can invoke the old behavior by connecting a function to the new
signal that returns the base weight like this:
@code{.cc}
triangulation.signals.weight.connect(
  [](const typename parallel::distributed::Triangulation<dim>::cell_iterator &,
     const typename parallel::distributed::Triangulation<dim>::CellStatus)
    -> unsigned int { return 1000; });
@endcode
