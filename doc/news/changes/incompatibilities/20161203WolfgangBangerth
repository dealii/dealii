Deprecated: The DataOutInterface::write_pvd_record() and
DataOutInterface::write_visit_record() functions were actually
independent of any kind of data being written. As a consequence,
they did not depend on the state of the DataOutInterface object
to which they belonged (or any object of a derived class). Such
functions typically reside in the DataOutBase namespace instead
where they have now been moved. The functions in DataOutInterface
are now deprecated.
