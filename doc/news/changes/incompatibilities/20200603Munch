Changed: The binary representation of the Triangulation and DoFHandler classes 
created by the function `save()` with release 9.2 cannot be read anymore with 
`load()` due to major internal changes
of these classes. This change also affects, i.a., the functions
`GridIn::read_vtu()` and `GridOut::write_vtu()`.
