Changed: The class FEEvaluation now uses a different internal data layout for
the gradients, exposed via FEEvaluation::begin_gradients(). Now, the entries
of the partial derivatives in the space directions are placed adjacent in
memory. The entries of different components are still separated by the entries
on all points. This change has been made to simplify the access in the
FEEvaluation::get_gradient() and FEEvaluation::submit_gradient() functions,
which is especially useful for the case with many FE components. For the
regular use of FEEvaluation apart from the plain pointers mentioned above,
there is no change in behavior.
