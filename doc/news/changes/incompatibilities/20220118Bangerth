Changed: The two algorithms in the ConsensusAlgorithms namespace
(along with their base class) required a callback function that
correctly sized the buffer into which the answer to a request was to
be written. These algorithms have been rewritten in ways that make
this no longer necessary, and they now correctly size these buffers
themselves. As a consequence, the ConsensusAlgorithms::Process class
no longer has the `prepare_for_answer()` function, and the
ConsensusAlgorithms::AnonymousProcess class no longer has a
corresponding member variable; in the latter case, the constructor of
the class also no longer takes an argument to this effect.
