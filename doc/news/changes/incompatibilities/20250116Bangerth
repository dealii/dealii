Changed: The header file `deal.II/grid/tria.h` used to automatically
include the header file `deal.II/grid/tria_description.h` that
declares classes such as CellData and SubCellData. But this led to a
circular set of inclusions because `deal.II/grid/tria_description.h`
also included `deal.II/grid/tria.h`, something that C++ allows but
that leads to other problems. As a consequence, `deal.II/grid/tria.h`
now no longer includes `deal.II/grid/tria_description.h`. If your
program uses the CellData, SubCellData, or similar classes previously
declared in `deal.II/grid/tria_description.h`, then you may want to
explicitly include `deal.II/grid/cell_data.h` (for the
CellData and SubCellData classes) or `deal.II/grid/tria_description.h`
(for the classes in namespace TriaDescription) in your program.

The file `deal.II/grid/cell_data.h` is new. As a consequence, if
you need to ensure that your code compiles with both deal.II 9.6
and 9.7, you can't directly include it. However,
`deal.II/grid/tria_description.h` now includes it, so a backward
compatible solution is to only include that file, even if you
only need the CellData and SubCellData classes but not the ones
in namespace TriaDescription.
