Changed: The default nodal point distribution of FE_Q, FE_DGQ,
FE_Q_DG0, FE_Q_Bubbles, and FE_TraceQ has been changed from equidistant
points to the node points of the corresponding Gauss-Lobatto quadrature
formula. For degrees one and two, the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature is
equidistant and thus the unit support points are as before. However, the
Gauss-Lobatto points are more dense towards the element boundaries at higher
degrees. This gives well-conditioned interpolation at arbitrary orders and
much more stable computations. While these node distribution was available
before, it was not very visible and often lead to misunderstandings by
inexperienced users. Most codes will not be affected by this change, even
those using cubic and higher degree polynomials, apart from slightly
different (better) interpolation behavior and different entries in solution
vectors. If you explicitly need equidistant points, use the constructors
<tt>FE_Q<dim>(QIterated<1>(QTrapez<1>(),degree))</tt> or
<tt>FE_DGQArbitraryNodes<dim>(QIterated<1>(QTrapez<1>(),degree))</tt>.
