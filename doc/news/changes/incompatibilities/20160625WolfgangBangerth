Changed: The conversion constructors of class Vector from the
PETScWrappers::Vector, PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector,
TrilinosWrappers::Vector, and TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector classes
are now marked as <code>explicit</code>, i.e., they will no longer
allow implicit, silent conversions. Such conversions lead to awkward
errors that are hard to debug, and in cases where they are necessary,
are best described in code through explicit casts.
