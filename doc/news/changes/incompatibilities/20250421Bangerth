Changed: Given that the MatrixOut class now allows to create "sparse"
representations (see the "Minor changes" section of this page), the
default for what kind of output is being produced has now also been
changed to create this "sparse" output, rather than the traditional
"dense" output. You can switch back to the traditional way in which
zero matrix entries are also represented in the visualization output
using the MatrixOut::Options::create_sparse_plot variable.
