Changed: On Windows builds, the compilation of examples is now enabled
by default. Please note that we are limited to static linking on Windows,
which means that the binaries are going to be large in filesize.
<br>
If you want to infer the old behavior, you can disable the compilation of
examples with `-D DEAL_II_COMPILE_EXAMPLES=OFF`.
