New: Added support for the CGAL library (www.cgal.org). The following features 
are supported:
<ul>
  <li>Conversion from dealii to CGAL point types and viceversa</li>
  <li>Conversion from dealii cell types to CGAL::Surface_mesh and viceversa</li>
  <li>Conversion from dealii Triangulation to CGAL::Surface_mesh and viceversa</li>
  <li>Insertion of deal.II points in CGAL triangulation types</li>
  <li>Conversion from CGAL::Triangulation_2 to Triangulation<dim, 2></li>
  <li>Conversion from CGAL::Triangulation_3 to Triangulation<dim, 3></li>
  <li>Conversion from CGAL::Surface_mesh or CGAL::Polyhedron_3 to Triangulation<2, 3></li>
</ul>
