Improved: The way DataPostprocessor receives its input has been updated.
<br>
In the past, the two functions we use to postprocess data got lists of arguments
for the solution, its derivatives, the evaluation points, and normal vectors.
This is not flexible enough: We can not easily add other information that
we have needed in the past or that users have requested, such as a pointer
to the cell we're currently on, or the material-id of the cell.
<br>
Rather than adding each possible argument anyone may want to use
individually to the list of the postprocessor function arguments, the
existing functions have been deprecated in favor of a new set of
functions DataPostprocessor::evaluate_scalar_field() and
DataPostprocessor::evaluate_vector_field() that
take a reference to a structure that contains these individual pieces
of information. We can extend the members of these structures without
backward compatibility issues because the functions still get a
reference to the same structure, we just grow the structure
itself. Functions that never used the new members of the structure
will continue to work as they always did.
