New: Add a collection of classes to manage user's quadrature point data:
CellDataStorage, TransferableQuadraturePointData and
parallel::distributed::ContinuousQuadratureDataTransfer.
The implementation of CellDataStorage is flexible to support different types of
data object at different cells. parallel::distributed::ContinuousQuadratureDataTransfer
provides a convenient interface to transfer quadrature point data between cells
of parallel::distributed::Triangulation.
