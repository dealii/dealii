New: Added a new Mapping class, MappingManifold, to use exact
geometrical information extracted from the Manifold description instead
of a polynomial approximation when computing transformations from the
reference to the real cell. This class allows the computation of
quadrature points, tangent vectors, and normal vectors which are exact
with respect to the geometrical description, and it uses the underlying
Manifold objects of the Triangulation. MappingManifold coincides with
MappingQ1 for the FlatManifold descriptor.
