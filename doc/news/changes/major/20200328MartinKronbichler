New: The step-67 tutorial program presents an explicit time integrator for the
compressible Euler equations discretized with a high-order discontinuous
Galerkin scheme using the matrix-free infrastructure. Besides the use of
matrix-free evaluators for systems of equations and over-integration, it also
presents MatrixFreeOperators::CellwiseInverseMassMatrix, a fast implementation
of the action of the inverse mass matrix in the DG setting using tensor
products.
