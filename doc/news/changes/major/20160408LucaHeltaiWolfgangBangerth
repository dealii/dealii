New: Manifold objects were previously only used to compute the
locations of individual new points on a manifold. Now, they are also
used to compute tangent vectors (via Manifold::get_tangent_vector()), and this
functionality provides the basis for computing normal vectors to manifolds
as well.
<br>
In many cases, tangent vectors can be computed quite easily if the
manifold has a functional description, i.e., if it can be
represented via the ChartManifold class. In those cases, it is only
necessary to overload the ChartManifold::push_forward_gradient()
function that computes the derivatives of the push forward operation.
