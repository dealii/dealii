New: ParticleHandler::insert_global_particles() allows one to pass to a ParticleHandler object a vector
of positions and a vector of properties to insert. Differently from the other insert* methods, 
this one allows particles to fall within artificial cells. In this case, the method infers who
should receive the positions and the properties, and sends this information to that process.
This is useful when constructing particles from non-matching triangulations, where the
distribution of the particle positions is arbitrary, and possibly not related to the locally owned cells.
