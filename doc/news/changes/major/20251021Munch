Improved: The hp adaptivity features for DG of MatrixFree have
been extended. For face-centric loops, neighboring cells can have
quadrature rules with different number of quadrature points. On
shared face, the quadrature rule is used that has the most quadrature
points. For element-centric loops, p-adaptivity is enabled. It is
experimental, since categorization and hp-enabled DoFHandler are not
supported at the same time by MatrixFree, limiting, in most cases, the
usablity to VectorizedArray<double, 1>.
