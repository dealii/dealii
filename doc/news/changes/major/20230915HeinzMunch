New: Introduce FERemoteEvaluation. This new class provides similar
interfaces as FEEvaluation, FEFaceEvaluation, and FEPointEvaluation.
It can be used to access values and/or gradients in quadrature points
at remote triangulations. In particular the class is designed such that
it can also be used for Nitsche-type mortaring or L2-Projection with
CGAL in the future.
