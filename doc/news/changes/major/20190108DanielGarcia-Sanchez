New: A new HDF5 interface has been added. The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) is
a cross platform and a high I/O performance format designed to store large
amounts of data. It supports serial and MPI I/O access. The deal.II's HDF5
interface can be used to write and read data, such the results of a simulation,
in a HDF5 file.
