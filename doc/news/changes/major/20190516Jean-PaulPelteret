New: Mesh adjustment can now be performed using the Mesquite library. Mesh quality
indicators, implemented by the Verdict library, have also been added. The smoothing
or mesh adaptation can be performed on either the Triangulation itself (physically
updating the vertex coordinates) or on a finite element field that is interpreted
as the displacement field. This implies that both the Lagrangian and Eulerian
descriptions of the mesh points can be adjusted. Furthermore, smoothing can be
done on meshes having undergone adaptive mesh refinement: each hierarchy in the
mesh is smoothed individually, rendering an "optimally" adapted mesh on all levels
of the grid.
