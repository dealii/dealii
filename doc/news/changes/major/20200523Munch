Changed: The internal data structures of DoFHandler have been modified to use 
compressed row storage, enabling it to also handle hp::DoFHandler functionalities.
Currently, the user can choose between the normal mode and the hp mode during
calling the constructur. Please note that the multigrid functionalities are only 
available during normal mode.
