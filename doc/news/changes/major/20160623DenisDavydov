New: Add new classes to expand a scalar finite element solution into
the orthogonal bases FESeries::Fourier and FESeries::Legendre. Also
provide auxiliary functions to calculate norms of subsets of expansion
coefficients FESeries::process_coefficients and linear regression
FESeries::linear_regression. Update step-27 to use this namespace to drive
the hp-adaptive FEM solution process.
