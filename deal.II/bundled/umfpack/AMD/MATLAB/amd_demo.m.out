 AMD Approximate minimum degree permutation.
     P = AMD (S) returns the approximate minimum degree permutation vector for
     the sparse matrix C = S+S'.  The Cholesky factorization of C (P,P), or
     S (P,P), tends to be sparser than that of C or S.  AMD tends to be faster
     than SYMMMD and SYMAMD, and tends to return better orderings than SYMMMD.
     S must be square. If S is full, amd (S) is equivalent to amd (sparse (S)).
 
     Usage:  P = amd (S) ;                   % finds the ordering
             [P, Info] = amd (S, Control) ;  % optional parameters & statistics
             Control = amd ;                 % returns default parameters
             amd ;                           % prints default parameters.
 
        Control (1); If S is n-by-n, then rows/columns with more than
            max (16, (Control (1))* sqrt(n)) entries in S+S' are considered
            "dense", and ignored during ordering.  They are placed last in the
            output permutation.  The default is 10.0 if Control is not present.
        Control (2): If nonzero, then aggressive absorption is performed.
            This is the default if Control is not present.
        Control (3): If nonzero, print statistics about the ordering.
 
        Info (1): status (0: ok, -1: out of memory, -2: matrix invalid)
        Info (2): n = size (A,1)
        Info (3): nnz (A)
        Info (4): the symmetry of the matrix S (0.0 means purely unsymmetric,
            1.0 means purely symmetric).  Computed as:
            B = tril (S, -1) + triu (S, 1) ; symmetry = nnz (B & B') / nnz (B);
        Info (5): nnz (diag (S))
        Info (6): nnz in S+S', excluding the diagonal (= nnz (B+B'))
        Info (7): number "dense" rows/columns in S+S'
        Info (8): the amount of memory used by AMD, in bytes
        Info (9): the number of memory compactions performed by AMD
 
     The following statistics are slight upper bounds because of the
     approximate degree in AMD.  The bounds are looser if "dense" rows/columns
     are ignored during ordering (Info (7) > 0).  The statistics are for a
     subsequent factorization of the matrix C (P,P).  The LU factorization
     statistics assume no pivoting.
 
        Info (10): the number of nonzeros in L, excluding the diagonal
        Info (11): the number of divide operations for LL', LDL', or LU
        Info (12): the number of multiply-subtract pairs for LL' or LDL'
        Info (13): the number of multiply-subtract pairs for LU
        Info (14): the max # of nonzeros in any column of L (incl. diagonal)
        Info (15:20): unused, reserved for future use
 
     An assembly tree post-ordering is performed, which is typically the same
     as an elimination tree post-ordering.  It is not always identical because
     of the approximate degree update used, and because "dense" rows/columns
     do not take part in the post-order.  It well-suited for a subsequent
     "chol", however.  If you require a precise elimination tree post-ordering,
     then do:
 
        P = amd (S) ;
        C = spones (S) + spones (S') ;  % skip this if S already symmetric
        [ignore, Q] = sparsfun ('symetree', C (P,P)) ;
        P = P (Q) ;

amd:  approximate minimum degree ordering, parameters:
    dense row parameter: 10
    (rows with more than max (10 * sqrt (n), 16) entries are
    considered "dense", and placed last in output permutation)
    aggressive absorption:  yes

    input matrix A is 24-by-24
    input matrix A has 160 nonzero entries

amd:  approximate minimum degree ordering, results:
    status: OK
    n, dimension of A:                                  24
    nz, number of nonzeros in A:                        160
    symmetry of A:                                      1.0000
    number of nonzeros on diagonal:                     24
    nonzeros in pattern of A+A' (excl. diagonal):       136

    # of memory compactions:                            0

    The following approximate statistics are for a subsequent
    factorization of A(P,P) + A(P,P)'.  They are slight upper
    bounds if there are no dense rows/columns in A+A', and become
    looser if dense rows/columns exist.

    nonzeros in L (excluding diagonal):                 97
    nonzeros in L (including diagonal):                 121
    # divide operations for LDL' or LU:                 97
    # multiply-subtract operations for LDL':            275
    # multiply-subtract operations for LU:              453
    max nz. in any column of L (incl. diagonal):        8

    chol flop count for real A, sqrt counted as 1 flop: 671
    LDL' flop count for real A:                         647
    LDL' flop count for complex A:                      3073
    LU flop count for real A (with no pivoting):        1003
    LU flop count for complex A (with no pivoting):     4497

Permutation vector:

Analyze A(p,p) with MATLAB's symbfact routine:
predicted nonzeros:    120
predicted flops:       656
predicted height:      16
predicted front size:  7
number of nonzeros in L (including diagonal):      120
floating point operation count for chol (A (p,p)): 656

Results from AMD's approximate analysis:
number of nonzeros in L (including diagonal):      121
floating point operation count for chol (A (p,p)): 671

Note that the nonzero and flop counts from AMD are slight
upper bounds.  This is due to the approximate minimum degree
method used, in conjunction with "mass elimination".

amd_2.c for more details.
