    <h1>Using and installing instructions for the p4est library</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.p4est.org/" target="_top">p4est</a> is a
      library that manages meshes that are distributed across multiple
      processors. It forms the basis of deal.II's implementation of
      finite element solvers that can use meshes that are too large to
      be held on each processor individually.
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to install p4est before deal.II. To do so, you can
      download it
      from <a href="http://www.p4est.org/" target="_top">here</a>, copy it to
      a fresh directory into which you should also copy
      the <a href="p4est-setup.sh">p4est-setup.sh script</a>. Then
      call the script as follows:
      <code>
	<pre>
	  ./p4est-setup.sh p4est-x-y-z.tar.gz /path/to/installation
	</pre>
      </code>
      where <code>p4est-x-y-z.tar.gz</code> is the name of the p4est
      distribution file, and <code>/path/to/installation</code> is a
      directory into which you want to install p4est.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this, you need to configure and build deal.II using a line
      like
      <code>
	<pre>
	  ./configure --with-p4est=/path/to/installation --enable-mpi
	  make all
	</pre>
      </code>
      Obviously, you can also add additional flags
      to <code>./configure</code> as described in the
      general <a href="../readme.html">ReadMe file</a>.
