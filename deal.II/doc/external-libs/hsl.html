    <h1>Using and installing instructions for functions from the
    Harwell Subroutine Library (HSL)</h1>

    <p>
    The <a href="http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/Activity/HSL"
    target="_top">Harwell Subroutine Library (HSL)</a> is a collection of
    Fortran77 files that implement various methods to solve linear
    systems of equations, but also cover various other aspects of
    mathematical algorithms. <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is presently
    able to use two of the sparse direct solvers implemented in that
    library:
    <ul>
    <li> <p> MA27: A modified Gauss elimination method for sparse
         symmetric indefinite systems.</p>
    <li> <p> MA47: A frontal elimination method for sparse symmetric
         indefinite systems.</p>
    </ul>
    Within <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, they are used by the classes 
    <code>SparseDirectMA27</code> and <code>SparseDirectMA47</code>
    (see the online reference in the LAC sublibrary for more
    information).
    </p>

    <p>
    With respect to the integration of these functions into
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, there are two problems: Firstly, for
    license reasons, we can not, however, include these solvers in the
    standard distribution of the library, so you have to download them
    yourself, if you want to use them. Secondly, these functions are
    usually downloaded as single files, rather than as a complete
    library, so one does not usually build up a whole library against which
    a <acronym>deal.II</acronym> program could be linked, but is left
    with the individual files.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our solution to this problem is as follows:
    <ul>
    <li> <p>
         If you want to use any of these subroutines, then you have to
         download them from the <a href="http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/Activity/HSL"
	 target="_top">HSL server</a>. Note that the license is rather
         restrictive.
	 </p>

	 <p>
	 For MA27, you have to have the main file, while for MA47
	 there are two files, one for the main algorithm and one with
	 support functions.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Drop these files into the directory
         <code>deal.II/contrib/hsl/source</code>, with names
	 <code>ma27.f</code> (for MA27), and <code>ma47.f</code> and
         <code>ma47dep.f</code> (for MA47). There should already be a
         file called <code>ma27sup.f</code>. Note that the exact names
         (including letter case) of the files matter.
	 </p>

    <li> <p>
         Run (or re-run) the <code>./configure</code> script in the
         top level directory of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. It should,
         at one point, print a message which functions from HSL it has
         found. This sets some flags for subsequent compilations 
	 (preprocessor defines <code>HAVE_HSL_MA27,
         HAVE_HSL_MA47</code> and Makefile variable
         <code>USE_CONTRIB_HSL=yes</code>) that 
         these functions have been found and can be used, rather than
         dummy functions that only display an error and abort the
         program if called.
	 <p>

    <li> <p>
         Compile the library (a description of how to do so is found
         in the <a href="../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a>
         file). If you had already made it, first clean the directory
         by calling <code>make clean</code> in the top level directory.
	 </p>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that if the respective functions have not been found at
    configure time, then the classes using them are still available to
    programs, but when called will issue an error message and abort
    the program with an exception.
    </p>

    <p>
    If HSL functions have been found, then we also have some Fortran77
    code in the system. Of course, the requires that some F77 compiler
    has been found at configure time, but note that this also changes
    the libraries that need to be linked to the program. For example,
    on Sun, these are the libraries <code>-lF77 -lsunmath
    -lM77</code>. Usually, the right set of additional libraries
    should be detected automatically at configure time, and the
    respective flags should also be set correctly without user
    interaction.
