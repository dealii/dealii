    <h1>Using and Installing <acronym>ARPACK</acronym></h1>
    <p> <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/">ARPACK</a> 
    is a collection of Fortran77 subroutines designed to solve large
    scale eigenvalue problems.

    After you downloaded the Fortran version of <acronym>ARPACK</acronym>
    and the patch unzip the files you got. That will create a directory 
    named <acronym>ARPACK</acronym>. If you need further instructions 
    please read the README file or the <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/SRC/instruction.arpack">instructions</a>. We will explain 
    here in a few steps what has to be done to be able to compile 
    <acronym>ARPACK</acronym>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>edit ARmake.inc</li>
      <ul>
        <li>change home to the correct directory</li>
        <li>choose which <acronym>BLAS</acronym> and 
        <acronym>LAPACK</acronym> you would like to use</li>
      </ul>
      <li>change the file second.f in the UTIL directory</li>
      <li>do <code>make lib</code> in the current directory 
      to build the standard library <code>libarpack_$(PLAT).a</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Note: For compilation of <acronym>ARPACK</acronym> we emphasise
    adding the compiler flag <code>-fPIC</code>. This is a definate
    requirement if we are compiling <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with
    shared libraries (which is the default). If we had preferred to be
    compiling <acronym>deal.II</acronym> without shared libraries,
    that's ok too; in that case we would do exactly the same thing
    as described above, but this time omitting
    the <code>-fPIC</code> flag from the scheme.
    </p>

    <p>
    Try to run one of the examples and compare the output. 
    How the output should look like is stated in the README 
    that can be found in the <code>EXAMPLES</code> directory.
    </p> 

    <p>
    If that output you produced looks like it should you can 
    proceed to comile <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with 
    <acronym>ARPACK</acronym>.
    </p>

    <h1>Interfacing <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      to <acronym>ARPACK</acronym></h1>

    <p> To be able to use the interface of <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
    for <acronym>ARPACK</acronym> we then
      configure <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with the following
      additional option:
	<code>--with-arpack=path/to/arpack</code>
