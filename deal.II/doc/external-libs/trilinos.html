    <h1>Interfacing <acronym>deal.II</acronym> to Trilinos</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov" target="_top">Trilinos</a> is a
      software package that provides lots of functionality for linear
      algebra, among other things. For example, it includes implementations of a variety of
      linear solvers, as well as various different sparse and dense matrix and
      vector formats. Trilinos also has many subpackages that deal with
      problems that go far beyond linear algebra, for example nonlinear
      solvers, automatic differentiation packages, uncertainty propagation
      engines, etc. Of particular interest to deal.II is their ability to
      provide this functionality both on sequential and parallel (using MPI)
      computers. Compared to <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/"
      target="_top">PETSc</a>, which is written in C, Trilinos is written in
      C++ and can be
      considered to be a more modern version of PETSc though both packages are
      under continuing development at their respective national laboratories.
    </p>

    <p>
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has wrapper classes to the linear algebra
      parts of Trilinos that provide almost the
      same interfaces as the built-in <acronym>deal.II</acronym> linear
      algebra classes. We use these interfaces for parallel computations based
      on MPI since the native deal.II linear algebra classes lack this
      ability. They are used, among other programs, in step-31 and step-32.
    </p>

    <p>
      While building deal.II with Trilinos is covered in
      the <a href="../readme.html">ReadMe file</a>, we here give an
      introduction to building Trilinos in such a way that it contains
      everything that we need from the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> side.
    </p>


    <h5>Installing Trilinos</h5>

    <p style="color: red">
      Note: Trilinos versions older than 10.12.2 can cause problems and are
      therefore not recommended. The newest version tested to work is 11.4.1.
      Major releases after this version may cause problems, so we recommend
      sticking to this version if at all possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trilinos uses <a href="http://cmake.org/">cmake</a> to configure and
      build. The following slightly longish set of commands will set up a
      reasonable configuration:
	<pre>

    cd trilinos-11.4.1
    mkdir build
    cd build

    cmake -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Sacado=ON \
      -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Stratimikos=ON \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
      -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-g -O3" \
      -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS="-g -O3" \
      -D CMAKE_FORTRAN_FLAGS="-g -O5" \
      -D Trilinos_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS="-lgfortran" \
      -D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=FALSE \
      -D Trilinos_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE=FALSE \
      -D TPL_ENABLE_MPI=ON \
      -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON \
      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/share/trilinos \
      ..

    make install
	</pre>
      You will need to adjust the path into which you want to install Trilinos
      in the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX line.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Parallel builds:</b>
      If your computer has more than one processor core, use
      <code>make -jN</code> instead of <code>make</code> in the last line
      above, where <code>N</code> is the number of processors you have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Trilinos sometimes searches for other libraries but can't find
      them if they are not in the usual directories or have other
      names. A common example are BLAS or LAPACK. In a case like
      this, you may have to specifically pass the directories and/or
      library names under which they can be found
      to <code>cmake</code>. For example, this may mean to add the
      following flags to the call above:
	<pre>

    -D BLAS_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING=goto \
    -D BLAS_LIBRARY_DIRS:STRING=/apps/GotoBLAS/lib64 \
    -D LAPACK_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING=lapack \
    -D LAPACK_LIBRARY_DIRS:STRING=/apps/lapack-3.2.1/lib64
	</pre>
