<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
  <p>
  Modern finite element software tends to become increasingly complex.
  Techniques like adaptive meshes, error estimation, multigrid methods, or
  <em>hp</em> finite elements require the programmer to work with extremely
  complicated data structures and sophisticated algorithms. Designing programs
  in a maintainable and expandable way while retaining run time efficiency has
  therefore become a major task in applied numerical analysis. In our
  experience, this task can only be fulfilled by using modern programming
  languages and tools.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  We will show how modern aspects of the C++ programming language, in
  particular templates, can be used to write algorithms for finite element
  programs in a dimension-independent way. This enables us to test algorithms
  in one or two space dimensions while using the same program for large scale
  computations in three space dimensions as well. It will be demonstrated that
  this is even possible without much loss in efficiency since tests for the
  actual space dimension at run time can almost completely be avoided.
  </p>

  <p>
  The idiom above is one of several modern aspects of C++ used in the design
  of the finite element library deal.II developed at the University
  of Heidelberg. We will give a sketch of its implementation and examples how
  it is used.
