<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
  An approach to solve the elastic wave equation by adaptive finite elements
  is presented. The strategy for adaptivity is founded on an a posteriori
  residual-based error estimate, where the error is measured with respect to
  an arbitrary target functional, allowing to focus the simulation to the
  computation of a given quantity of interest. The cell-wise error indicators
  are computationally evaluated and used for refinement of the space-time
  mesh. The resulting grids are usually highly localized and tailored to the
  target functional. The performance of the approach is demonstrated with two
  examples.
