<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIR>
  We present an adaptive finite element method for solving the acoustic
  wave equation. Using a global duality argument and Galerkin orthogonality,
  we derive an identity for the error with respect to an arbitrary functional
  output of the solution. The error identity is evaluated by solving the
  dual problem numerically. The resulting local cell-wise error indicators
  are used in adaptation process. In this way, the space-time mesh can be
  tailored for the efficient computation of the quantity of interest.
  We give an overview of the implementation of the proposed method and
  illustrate its performance by several numerical examples.
