<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> tutorial contains a collection of
programs, each more
or less built atop of previous ones, which demonstrate various
aspects of the library. Each such example has the following structure:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Introduction:</b> What the program does, including
       the mathematical model, and
       what programming techniques are new.
  <li> <b>The commented program:</b> An extensively documented listing of the
       source code.
  <li> <b>Results:</b> The output of the program, with comments and
       interpretation.
  <li> <b>The plain program:</b> The source code stripped of
       all comments.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
You can browse the available tutorial programs as
<a href="toc-map.html">a graph that shows how
tutorial programs build upon each other</a> (below);
as <a href="toc-list.html">a list that provides a short
    synopsis of each program</a>; and
<a href="toc-topics.html">grouped by topics</a>. 
Some of the programs also jointly form
the <a href="../../doxygen/deal.II/group__geodynamics.html">geodynamics
  demonstration suite</a>.
</p>

<p>
The programs are in the <code>examples/</code> directory of your local deal.II
installation. If you go into one of the tutorial directories, you can compile
the program by typing <strong>make</strong>, and run it
using <strong>make run</strong>. The latter command also compiles the program
if that has not already been done. The Makefiles in the different
directories are based on the small program Makefile template described
<a href="../../development/index.html" target="_top">in this section</a>.

<h3>Connections between tutorial programs</h3>

The following graph shows the connections between tutorial programs and
how they build on each other.
Click on any of the boxes to go to one of the programs. If you hover
your mouse pointer over a box, a brief description of the program
should appear.

<p>
In the graph above, green octagons indicate programs that show basic
techniques. Orange boxes indicate advanced techniques, while the programs
shown as yellow, light blue, and dark blue boxes are applications in fluid
dynamics, solid mechanics, and time dependent problems, respectively.
