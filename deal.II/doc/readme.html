    <h2>System requirements</h2>

    <p>
    At present, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has been
    developed and tested on the following platforms:
    <ul>
      <li>Linux on x86, with gcc 3.3, 3.4, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5; and
          Intel ICC 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0;
      <li>Linux on x86_64 (Opteron, AMD64, and Intel EM64T chips) using gcc
          3.3, 3.4, 4.0, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5;
      <li>Mac OS X 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 (on both PowerPC and Intel
          processors) with gcc 3.x, 4.0, and 4.1;
      <li>Sun Solaris 2.5, 2.6, 7, 8, and 9 on Sparc, with
          gcc 3.2, 3.3, 3.4;
      <li>Linux on IA-64 (Itanium), using gcc 3.4.2, 4.1.2 and ICC
          9.1, ICC 10.0;
      <li>Linux on x86, with the PathScale EKOPath compiler version
          2.2 (though only with static instead of shared libraries);
      <li>Linux on x86, with Portland Groups (PGI) pgCC compiler
          version 7.1 and 7.2;
      <li>AIX 5.3 on Power 6, with gcc 4.3;
      <li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com"
          target="_top">Cygwin/Windows</a> with cygwin1.dll versions
          1.5.xx, and gcc 3.3 and 3.4 under Windows XP and
          NT. For <a href="http://dealii.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Windows"
          target="_top">installing under Windows</a>, please refer to
          additional information on
          the <a href="http://dealii.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Main_Page"
          target="_top"><acronym>deal.II</acronym> Wiki</a>!
    </ul>
    Newer versions of the compilers listed above are also likely to
    work, as are other brands of Unix (for example Sun Solaris,
    FreeBSD, or Linux on chips like SPARC, PA-RISC, PowerPC, etc) using
    gcc as compiler, but we do not regularly test them.
    Furthermore, for the following list of systems, we have collected
    our experiences on separate pages:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="platforms/sgi-irix.html" target="body">SGI
           IRIX64</a> with gcc 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, and with MIPSpro 7.41;

      <li> <a href="platforms/dec-osf5.html" target="body">OSF1 V5.3 on
           Alpha</a> with gcc newer than 2.95.x (the same notes probably also
	   apply to Linux on DEC Alpha) and using DEC's cxx compiler version
           6.3; for older systems with OSF1 4.0 and cxx6.0 please see
	   <a href="platforms/dec-osf.html" target="body">this page</a>.

      <li> <a href="platforms/ibm_aix_xlc.html" target="body">IBM AIX
           with IBM's xlC 5.0 and 6.0 compilers</a>.

      <li> <a href="platforms/windows.html" target="body">Microsoft
           Windows 95/98/2000/NT/XP</a>.

      <li> <a href="platforms/bcc.html" target="body">Borland C++/Kylix</a>.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses only very few features of an
    operating system. It should therefore be rather simple to port it
    to other systems, at least with the compilers stated above. If
    your system is not on this list, take a look at the page that
    describes <a href="porting.html" target="body">porting the library
    to new systems</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
    In order to compile and use the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
    libraries you need to have the following programs installed:
    <ul>
      <li> <p>
           A fairly complete C++ compiler. Various working compilers
           are listed above. We do not support gcc versions older than
           3.2 any more at this time.
           Note that we are interested in writing portable C++, so if you find
           something that does not work with your compiler, we are
           likely to accept patches.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           Perl: Any Perl 5.x version should work.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           Make: We use <a href="http://www.gnu.org"
           target="_top">GNU make</a>, version 3.78 or later which also
           has rather good support for parallel builds, so you may
           want to consider this version if you have a multiprocessor
           system. GNU make 3.77 had a serious flaw in the
           <code>$(wildcard ...)</code> function which prevented us
           from compiling some parts of the library (most of our
           Makefiles use a workaround, though). Older GNU make
           versions are likely to work, but since they are hardly
           installed on systems today, we don't regularly test
           this. Other make programs (i.e. non-GNU) will usually fail
           to work and are not supported.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           For debugging programs, we have found that the
	   <a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_top">GNU
	   debugger gdb</a> is a valuable tool.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           In case you want to generate the documentation from the
           header files, you need a copy of <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/"
           target="_top">doxygen</a> on your machine. Versions 1.4.6
           and later are known to work. If you
           have this program, you can generate all the documentation on
	   your local machine. If not, you can still work with the library and
	   use the documentation provided on our homepage for reference. Note
           that in order to generate inheritance graphs for classes, doxygen
           can use the <code>dot</code> program, which is part of the <a
           href="http://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a>
           package. If this program is not available, then doxygen attempts to
           generate text-mode graphs; these are much less nice, though.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           Doxygen also generates printable API documentation. It is located
           in the directories <code>doc/doxygen/LaTeX</code> and
           subdirectories. To generate printable versions, you need a latex
           installation. However, the present size of this API information is
           about 4000 pages, so you may not want to print it, and rather rely
           on the online version. The more interesting part of the
           documentation to print would probably be the example programs, but
           we don't presently have a way to do that apart from printing it
           directly from the browser or by using the <code>html2ps</code>
           program.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           The library generates output in formats readable by
           <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/gnuplot/gnuplot-faq.html" target="_top">GNUPLOT</a>,
	   <a href="http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/" target="_top">GMV
 	                              (general mesh viewer)</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.amtec.com" target="_top">Tecplot</a> (ASCII and binary),
           <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/"
                 target="_top">Visualization Toolkit (Vtk)</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.avs.com" target="_top">AVS Explorer</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.opendx.org" target="_top">Open DX</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.povray.org" target="_top">Povray</a>,
           and directly to Encapsulated Postscript. GNUPLOT and a
           postscript viewer (for EPS) should be available almost
           everywhere. In the last few years, most new visualization
           programs have moved to support VTK format, so there are a
           number of excellent programs that can read VTK, such as <a
           href="http://www.llnl.gov/visit/" target="_top">Visit</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Index.html"
           target="_top">ParaView</a>, as well as many others.
	   GMV and Open DX are freely available for most Unix
           platforms. Povray is freely available for almost all
           platforms. AVS is a commercial program available for most
           Unix flavors. Tecplot is a commercial program available for
           Windows and most Unix platforms. HiVision is available for free after
           registration.
	   </p>
    </ul>

    <p>
    In case you didn't find your favorite graphics format above it
    might be of interest that it is quite simple to add it to the list
    of supported ones (take a look at
    base/include/base/data_out_base.h and
    base/source/data_out_base.cc to see how output formats are
    implemented), as only a simple intermediate format needs to be
    converted into a graphics format, without references to cells,
    nodes, types of finite elements, and the like. Since your
    preferred output format is likely to be similar to one for which
    we already have a backend, adaptation is usually simple. In case
    you write such a function, we would be happy to integrate it into
    the library.
    </p>



    <a name="installation"></a>
    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
    The whole library usually comes as a .tar.gz file, that is a
    tarred file archive which is compressed with gzip. After unpacking
    it with gunzip and tar (or <tt>tar xzf</tt> if you use GNU tar), you will
    find several subdirectories. First run the script
    <pre><code>
         ./configure
    </code></pre>
    in the top-level directory,
    which sets some paths and finds out what compiler you
    use. ./configure supports several flags which are discussed
    further down <a href="#configuration-options">below</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The most important result of <code>./configure</code> is the
    creation of the files <code>common/Make.global_options</code> and
    <code>base/include/base/config.h</code>. The first
    file contains compiler options, paths, etc which you may want to
    use in the <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">Makefiles
    of your own projects</a>. It is definitely a good
    idea to include it into your Makefile, to allow using the same
    flags for compilation between library files and the files of your
    project, and to access the paths of the library files. To find
    out about the supported flags, take a look at the file. Also,
    information about Makefiles can be found in the section on
    <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">development</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The second generated file contains a number of preprocessor
    definitions, that are mostly used to indicate the features and
    bugs of the compiler in use.
    </p>

    <p>
    After configuring, type `make', to obtain the following help (this
    output may change slightly over time, just try it):

    ========================================================================
    </code></pre>

    <p>
    To execute one of the commands, type for example `make all'. Building
    all libraries takes somewhere between 10 minutes and 1 hour,
    depending on your machine and requires about 1.1 GB of free disk
    space. If you have a multi-processor machine, you can call `make -j4
    target-name' to let `make' call multiple instances of the compiler
    (in this case four). This speeds up compilation by about
    the factor given after `-j', at least if you have as many
    processors.
    </p>

    <p>
    After `make' has finished, you will have two sets of
    libraries. The first consists of the files
    <ul>
      <li> <p><code>lib/libbase</code>: The library containing the
      code of the classes in the <code>/base</code> directory. These
      are mostly helper classes (such as output of various data in
      different data formats), and classes of general numerical
      interest (functions, tensors, etc.).
      </p>

      <li> <p><code>lib/liblac</code>: <code>lac</code> is the
      acronym for <i>L</i>inear <i>A</i>lgebra <i>C</i>lasses. This
      library contains classes representing vectors, matrices, sparse
      matrices, linear solvers, and the like.
      </p>

      <li> <p><code>lib/libdeal_II_2d</code>: This is the
      library containing all the classes representing finite element
      methods, grid handling, different finite elements,
      etc. There will also be libraries
      for one and three spatial dimensions.
      </p>
    </ul>
    Each library file will have a suffix that depends on the system.
    If static libraries were requested during
    configuration, then the suffix is <code>.a</code>. For shared
    libraries, it is <code>.so</code> (for most Unix-like and Linux
    systems), <code>.dylib</code> (for Mac OS X), or <code>.dll</code>
    (for Cygwin/Windows).
    </p>

    <p>
    For each library, there will also be another one with an
    infix <code>.g</code> between library name and suffix. The
    difference between the two sets of libraries is the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>
      The <code>.g</code> versions contain debugging
      information (the infix <code>.g</code> was historically chosen
      because gcc uses the flag <code>-g</code> to request
      debugging information).
      </p>

      <p>
      In addition, the <code>.g</code> libraries
      contain a large number of assertions (presently
      about 5000) checking the validity of parameters to functions and
      internal states. These assertions have proven to be an
      invaluable means to finding programming bugs since they will
      almost always abort your program if something goes wrong. In our
      experience, more than ninety per cent of all errors are invalid
      parameters (such as vectors having the wrong size, etc) and they
      are usually found almost instantaneously displaying the file
      name and line number of where the problem occurred.
      </p>

      <p>
      You will want to link your programs against the
      <code>.g.a</code> versions of the libraries while developing
      your programs.
      </p>

      <li>
      <p>
      The libraries without the <code>.g</code> infix do not contain
      neither debugging information nor assertions. They are therefore much
      smaller and your program will run significantly faster (the
      performance penalty of the <code>.g</code> libraries is
      between a factor of two and ten, depending on which parts of
      the libraries you use). Furthermore, these libraries are
      compiled with optimization options of the compiler.
      </p>

      <p>
      You will want to link your programs against these libraries when
      they run stable and are used in production mode.
      </p>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>
    Apart from the libraries, you should generate the full set of
    documentation files, by typing `make online-doc'; this takes some
    minutes but you will
    have (almost) all the documentation locally on your computer. You
    can access all documentation through <a
    href="documentation.html" target="body">this page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    At this point, you have generated everything necessary to write
    programs based on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. If you are new to
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you may want to continue with the
    <a href="doxygen/tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>.
    </p>



    <a name="configuration-options"></a>
    <h3>Configuration options</h3>

    <a name="choose-compiler"></a></a>
    <h4>Changing the compiler or compiler flags</h4>

    If <code>configure</code> uses a wrong compiler, there are two
    options: first, you can prepend your search path by the directory
    of the desired compiler. Alternatively, if your full compiler paths are
    <tt>mycc</tt> and <tt>myc++</tt> for your C and C++ compilers,
    respectively, type into your <tt>csh</tt>:
    <pre>
      setenv CC  mycc
      setenv CXX myc++
      ./configure
    </pre>
    or into your <tt>bash</tt>
    <pre>
      export CC=mycc
      export CXX=myc++
      ./configure
    </pre>

    <p>
    The paths to these compilers are stored in the
    <code>common/Make.global_options</code> files, so the compilers
    are always used when compiling the library even if the environment
    variables are no more set later (for example if you are working
    within another window, or have unset the variables for other
    purposes).
    </p>

    <p>
    If all you want to do is pass different compiler flags to the
    compiler, set the standard environment variables <code>CXXFLAGS,
    CFLAGS, LDFLAGS</code> before calling
    <code>./configure</code>. For example, to produce
    <code>gprof</code> output, do:
    <pre>
      setenv CXXFLAGS -pg
      setenv LDFLAGS -pg
      configure &lt;configure-options&gt;
    </pre>
    The flags so set are used for both optimized and debug mode. If you want to
    set flags for only one of these two cases, you should
    set <code>CXXFLAGSO</code> or <code>CXXFLAGSG</code>, respectively.
    </p>


    <a name="optional">
    <h4>Selecting optional behavior</h4></a>

    You can give several flags to ./configure:
    <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--enable-shared</code>: Compile the files of deal.II into
      shared libraries, rather than statically linked
      libraries. Enabling this option saves disk space, link time and
      start-up time, so this is the default. Some systems
      might not support shared libraries, in which case you should
      call ./configure with the parameter
      <code>--disable-shared</code>.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--enable-threads</code>: This flag indicates that those
      parts of the library that support this compute in parallel,
      using multiple threads, making programs significantly faster on
      machines with multiple cores or processors. The default is to
      use multiple threads since most machines today have several
      processor cores. If this is not desired,
      use <code>--disable-threads</code>.

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--with-cpu=...</code>: Enable specific optimization
      flags for a particular processor. Programs compiled with these options
      might not execute on an other system, but will be faster by up to
      30 percent on the CPU selected.
      </p>

      <p>
      For a complete list of supported values of this switch, you may
      take a look at the file <code>aclocal.m4</code> in the top-level
      directory. However, the most commonly used value
      is <code>--with-cpu=native</code> indicating that the compiler
      should determine the CPU we are running on by itself and
      optimize for it.
      </p>

      <p>
      Optimizations currently only work in conjunction with gcc. Without the
      option <code>--with-cpu=xxx</code>, no cpu specific optimization is applied.
      Furthermore, CPU specific optimization is switched on only for the compilation
      of the optimized library versions.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--with-doxygen=...</code>: Select the specified executable
      of <code>doxygen</code> over the one automatically found by
      <code>./configure</code>. May also be used if no
      <code>doxygen</code> can be found automatically.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Please note that running ./configure stores the paths to some
    programs, such as the compilers or the Perl interpreter. The
    compiler which will be used when compiling the library (or your
    own application) is therefore selected at the time of
    configuration and independent of the setting of your $PATH
    environment value at the time when you run <code>make</code>. If
    you want to change the compiler used, you will therefore have
    to re-run ./configure with the new compiler being in the $PATH
    environment variable.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is in general a good idea to run `make clean'
    before re-configuring.

    <h4>Optional interfaces to other software packages</h4>

    <p> <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with built-in support for a
    number of external software packages. These packages are
    sometimes detected automatically, sometimes they must be enabled explicitly
    during configuration by adding the option <tt>--with-package</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>These supported software packages comprise (the following list contains
    trademarks belonging to their owners):
    </p>

    <dl>
    <dt>TECPLOT</dt>
    <dd>Autodetected if one of the variables <tt>$TECHOME</tt>,
    <tt>$TEC80HOME</tt> or <tt>$TEC90HOME</tt> points to a valid installation
    of the tecio library. If enabled, allows data output in TECPLOT format.
    </dd>

    <a name="umfpack"></a>
    <dt>UMFPACK</dt>
    <dd>Enabled by <tt>--with-umfpack</tt>. If no argument is given,
    use the version of UMFPACK that comes bundled with deal.II. If you
    want a different version of UMFPACK, provide the path to that
    version as an argument. Enabling UMFPACK adds the
    class <tt>SparseDirectUMFPACK</tt> to the library. The default is to not
    use UMFPACK.

    <p>
    If you want to use an external installation of UMFPACK, but UMFPACK was
    installed as
    part of <code>/usr</code> or <code>/opt</code>, instead of local
    directories in a home directory for example, you can use configure
    switches <code>--with-umfpack-include, --with-umfpack-libs</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that UMFPACK has its own license; if
    you want to use it with deal.II, please read it and make sure that you
    agree with it. You can find the license of UMFPACK <a
    href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/">here</a>. We
    include UMFPACK in the deal.II distributions courtesy of its author,

      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can interface to
      the <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/"
      target="_top">PETSc</a> library. The simplest way to do so is to
      set the <code>PETSC_DIR</code> and <code>PETSC_ARCH</code>
      environment variables. More information and configuration
      options can be found by issuing <code>./configure --help</code>
      at the command line, or, <a href="readme-petsc-trilinos.html"

      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can also interface to
      the <a href="http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/"
      target="_top">SLEPc</a> library. The way to do it is to set
      the <code>SLEPC_DIR</code> environment variable by
      passing <code>--with-slepc=/path/to/slepc</code>
      to <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s <code>./configure</code> script.
      The use of SLEPc is optional, however, for the interface with
      SLEPc to work at all, <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s interface to
      PETSc must also be configured correctly (see the notes above on
      how to do this).

      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can also interface to <a
      href="http://trilinos.sandia.gov" target="_top">Trilinos</a>. The
      simplest way to use these interfaces is to
      pass <code>--with-trilinos=/path/to/trilinos</code>
      to <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s <code>./configure</code> script. More
      configuration options can be found <a href="readme-petsc-trilinos.html"

    <a name="metis"></a>
    <dt>Metis</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      In order to generate partitionings of triangulations, we have
      functions that
      call <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/index.html"
      target="_top">METIS</a> library. METIS is a library that
      provides various methods to partition graphs, which we use to
      define which cell belongs to which part of a triangulation. The
      main point in using METIS is to generate partitions so that the
      interfaces between cell blocks are as small as possible. This
      data can, in turn, be used to distribute degrees of freedom onto
      different processors when using PETSc and/or SLEPc in parallel
      mode.
      </p>

      <p>
      As with PETSc and SLEPc, the use of METIS is optional. If you
      wish to use it, you can do so by having a METIS installation
      around at the time of calling
      <code>./configure</code> by either
      setting the <code>METIS_DIR</code> environment
      variable denoting the path to the METIS library, or using the
      <code>--with-metis</code> flag. If METIS was installed as part
      of <code>/usr</code> or <code>/opt</code>, instead of local directories
      in a home directory for example, you can use configure
      switches <code>--with-metis-include, --with-metis-libs</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
	On some systems, when using shared libraries for deal.II, you may get
	warnings of the kind <code>libmetis.a(pmetis.o): relocation R_X86_64_32
	  against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared
	  object; recompile with -fPIC</code> when linking. This can be
	avoided by recompiling METIS with <code>-fPIC</code> as a compiler
	flag.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <a name="blas"></a>
    <dt>BLAS, LAPACK</dt>

    <dd> <p>If <code>--with-blas=blasname</code> and/or
    <code>--with-lapack=lapackname</code> is given, provide wrappers
    around some of the BLAS and LAPACK functions, and link with the
    respective libraries. It will make sure that we link with the
    required FORTRAN libraries. If no argument is given to
    <code>--with-blas</code>, then a BLAS library
    <code>libblas.a</code> or <code>libblas.so</code> is searched for
    in the default locations of your system, and similarly for LAPACK.</p>

    <p>If your BLAS or LAPACK libraries are not in the standard search
    path of your linker, you have to tell the linker where to find them.
    The path is not given as an argument to
    <code>--with-blas</code>. Rather, you set the variable
    <code>LDFLAGS</code> accordingly or make sure that the path is in
    your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or similar. For details, please
    look up the documentation of your linker. An example configuration
    for Linux is:</p>
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-blas=myblas LDFLAGS=-L/my/lib/
    </pre>
    <p> This example will search for a library
    <code>libmyblas.a</code> or <code>libmyblas.so</code> in the
    directory <code>/my/lib</code> and elsewhere in the system library
    paths.</p>

    <p>Some versions of BLAS and LAPACK need additional libraries
    to be linked with. Such an example is the
    <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">automatically tuned
    linear algebra software (ATLAS)</a>. The BLAS version of this
    package also needs declarations from <code>libatlas.a</code>,
    so it must be included. Using the standard library names of
    atlas, the include for BLAS reads
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-blas='f77blas -latlas'
    </pre>
    assuming that the library files <code>libf77blas.a</code> and
    <code>libatlas.a</code> or the respective shared libraries
    <code>*.so</code> are in libraries included in
    <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. LAPACK generated by ATLAS is
    included in a similar fashion.</p>

    library. Can also be enabled by
    <tt>--with-netcdf=/path/to/netcdf</tt> which overrides the path in
    <tt>$NETCDF_DIR</tt>. If enabled, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> allows grid
    input in NetCDF format (GridIn::read_netcdf). If NetCDF was installed as
    part of <code>/usr</code> or <code>/opt</code>, instead of local
    directories in a home directory for example, you can use configure
    switches <code>--with-netcdf-include, --with-netcdf-libs</code>.

    <h2>License</h2>

    <p>
    We have placed <acronym>deal.II</acronym> under an <a
    href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source</a>
    license, which allows you to use the library free of charge. You
    are guaranteed full access to the source code and are encouraged
    to help in the further development of the library.  Follow <a
    href="license.html" target="body">this link</a> to read the full

    <p>
    The basics of the license are in short:
    <ul>
      <li>
         The library comes free of charge for all users, but
         we keep a copyright in it. We will grant everyone access to
         the library and its source code, provided they keep to the
         <a href="license.html" target="body">license</a>.

      <li>
        The libraries may not be stripped of our copyright. We would
        appreciate being contacted if you want to use the library
        commercially.

      <li>
        Scientific publications presenting results obtained with these
        libraries should acknowledge the use of the library and name
        its principal authors (at present Wolfgang Bangerth, Ralf
        Hartmann and Guido Kanschat). Citation of the reports named on
        the homepage is appreciated.
    </ul>

    Note that since our institutes are evaluated at regular intervals,
    we are interested in documenting the use of the programs and
    libraries we create. We are therefore interested in collecting
    publications with results obtained with the aid of these libraries
    and would therefore like to ask you to drop us a note about every
    such publication. Your publication will then be listed on the
    project homepage.

    <p>

    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can interface with a number of <a
