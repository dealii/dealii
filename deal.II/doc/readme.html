    <h2>System requirements</h2>

    <p>
    At present, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has been
    developed and tested on the following platforms:
    <ul>
      <li>Linux on x86, with gcc 3.3, 3.4, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5; and
          Intel ICC 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, 8.1, 9.0, 10.0 and 11.0;
      <li>Linux on x86_64 (Opteron, AMD64, and Intel EM64T chips) using gcc
          3.3, 3.4, 4.0, 4.1, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5;
      <li>Mac OS X 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 (on both PowerPC and Intel
          processors) with gcc 3.x, 4.0, and 4.1;
      <li>Sun Solaris 2.5, 2.6, 7, 8, and 9 on Sparc, with
          gcc 3.2, 3.3, 3.4;
      <li>Linux on IA-64 (Itanium), using gcc 3.4.2, 4.1.2 and ICC
          9.1, ICC 10.0;
      <li>Linux on x86, with the PathScale EKOPath compiler version
          2.2 (though only with static instead of shared libraries);
      <li>Linux on x86, with Portland Groups (PGI) pgCC compiler
          version 7.1 and 7.2;
      <li>AIX 5.3 on Power 6, with gcc 4.3;
      <li><a href="http://www.cygwin.com"
          target="_top">Cygwin/Windows</a> with cygwin1.dll versions
          1.5.xx, and gcc 3.3 and 3.4 under Windows XP and
          NT. For <a href="http://dealii.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Windows"
          target="_top">installing under Windows</a>, please refer to
          additional information on
          the <a href="http://dealii.sourceforge.net/index.php?title=Main_Page"
          target="_top"><acronym>deal.II</acronym> Wiki</a>!
    </ul>
    Newer versions of the compilers listed above are also likely to
    work, as are other brands of Unix (for example Sun Solaris,
    FreeBSD, or Linux on chips like SPARC, PA-RISC, PowerPC, etc) using
    gcc as compiler, but we do not regularly test them.
    Furthermore, for the following list of systems, we have collected
    our experiences on separate pages:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="platforms/sgi-irix.html" target="body">SGI
           IRIX64</a> with gcc 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, and with MIPSpro 7.41;

      <li> <a href="platforms/dec-osf5.html" target="body">OSF1 V5.3 on
           Alpha</a> with gcc newer than 2.95.x (the same notes probably also
	   apply to Linux on DEC Alpha) and using DEC's cxx compiler version
           6.3; for older systems with OSF1 4.0 and cxx6.0 please see
	   <a href="platforms/dec-osf.html" target="body">this page</a>.

      <li> <a href="platforms/ibm_aix_xlc.html" target="body">IBM AIX
           with IBM's xlC 5.0 and 6.0 compilers</a>.

      <li> <a href="platforms/windows.html" target="body">Microsoft
           Windows 95/98/2000/NT/XP</a>.

      <li> <a href="platforms/bcc.html" target="body">Borland C++/Kylix</a>.
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses only very few features of an
    operating system. It should therefore be rather simple to port it
    to other systems, at least with the compilers stated above. If
    your system is not on this list, take a look at the page that
    describes <a href="porting.html" target="body">porting the library
    to new systems</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
    In order to compile and use the <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
    libraries you need to have the following programs installed:
    <ul>
      <li> <p>
           A fairly complete C++ compiler. Various working compilers
           are listed above. We do not support gcc versions older than
           3.2 any more at this time.
           Note that we are interested in writing portable C++, so if you find
           something that does not work with your compiler, we are
           likely to accept patches.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           Perl: Any Perl 5.x version should work.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           Make: We use <a href="http://www.gnu.org"
           target="_top">GNU make</a>, version 3.78 or later which also
           has rather good support for parallel builds, so you may
           want to consider this version if you have a multiprocessor
           system. GNU make 3.77 had a serious flaw in the
           <code>$(wildcard ...)</code> function which prevented us
           from compiling some parts of the library (most of our
           Makefiles use a workaround, though). Older GNU make
           versions are likely to work, but since they are hardly
           installed on systems today, we don't regularly test
           this. Other make programs (i.e. non-GNU) will usually fail
           to work and are not supported.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           For debugging programs, we have found that the
	   <a href="http://www.gnu.org" target="_top">GNU
	   debugger gdb</a> is a valuable tool. Other options
	   are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/" target="_top">DDD</a>
	   and <a href="http://www.kdbg.org/" target="_top">kdbg</a>, both of
	   which have graphical user interfaces. Most integrated development
	   environments like <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/"
				target="_top">kdevelop</a> or
	   <a href="http://eclipse.org/" target="_top">Eclipse</a> have built
	   in debuggers as well.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           In case you want to generate the documentation locally on your
	   machine from the header <acronym>deal.II</acronym> files, you need a
	   copy of <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/" target="_top">doxygen</a>
	   on your machine. If not, you can still work with the library and 
	   use the documentation provided on our homepage for reference. Note
           that in order to generate inheritance graphs for classes, doxygen
           can use the <code>dot</code> program, which is part of the <a
           href="http://www.graphviz.org" target="_top">GraphViz</a>
           package. If this program is not available, then doxygen attempts to
           generate text-mode graphs; these are much less nice, though.
	   </p>

      <li> <p>
           The library generates output in formats readable by
           <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/gnuplot/gnuplot-faq.html" target="_top">GNUPLOT</a>,
	   <a href="http://www-xdiv.lanl.gov/XCM/gmv/" target="_top">GMV
 	                              (general mesh viewer)</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.amtec.com" target="_top">Tecplot</a> (ASCII and binary),
           <a href="http://public.kitware.com/VTK/"
                 target="_top">Visualization Toolkit (Vtk)</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.avs.com" target="_top">AVS Explorer</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.opendx.org" target="_top">Open DX</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.povray.org" target="_top">Povray</a>,
           and directly to Encapsulated Postscript. GNUPLOT and a
           postscript viewer (for EPS) should be available almost
           everywhere. In the last few years, most new visualization
           programs have moved to support VTK format. There are a
           number of excellent programs that can read VTK, such as <a
           href="http://www.llnl.gov/visit/" target="_top">Visit</a>,
	   <a href="http://www.paraview.org/HTML/Index.html"
           target="_top">ParaView</a>, as well as others.
	   Povray is freely available for almost all
           platforms. AVS is a commercial program available for most
           Unix flavors. Tecplot is a commercial program available for
           Windows and most Unix platforms.
	   </p>

       <p>
       In case you didn't find your favorite graphics format above, adding a new
       writer to <acronym>deal.II</acronym> is not too difficult as only a
       simple
       intermediate format needs to be 
       converted into output (without references to cells,
       nodes, types of finite elements, and the like).
       </p>
    </ul>




    <a name="installation"></a>
    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
    The whole library usually comes as a .tar.gz file, that is a
    tarred file archive which is compressed with gzip. After unpacking
    it with gunzip and tar (or <tt>tar xzf</tt> if you use GNU tar), you will
    find several subdirectories. First run the script
    <pre><code>
         ./configure
    </code></pre>
    in the top-level directory,
    which sets some paths and finds out what compiler you
    use. ./configure supports several flags which are discussed
    further down <a href="#configuration-options">below</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The most important result of <code>./configure</code> is the
    creation of the files <code>common/Make.global_options</code> and
    <code>include/deal.II/base/config.h</code>. The first
    file contains compiler options, paths, etc which you may want to
    use in the <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">Makefiles
    of your own projects</a>. More
    information about Makefiles can also be found in the section on
    <a href="development/index.html" target="_top">development</a>.
    The second generated file contains preprocessor
    definitions that can be used to conditionalize pieces of the source code.
    </p>

    <p>
    After configuring, type `make', to obtain the following help (this
    output may change slightly over time, just try it):

    <pre><code>
    ========================================================================
    =              Global Makefile for the deal.II libraries               =

    =                                                                      =
    = The following targets exist:                                         =

    =    debug      : the debug version of the deal.II library             =
    =    optimized  : the optimized version of the deal.II library         =
    =                                                                      =

    =    online-doc : generate the documentation in HTML format            =
    =    TODO       : create a "TODO" file from the source files           =
    =    TAGS       : create a TAGS file from include and source files     =

    =    distclean  : removes all object files, libraries, etc in subdirs  =
    ========================================================================
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      To execute one of the commands, type for example <code>make
	all</code>. Building all libraries takes somewhere between 4 minutes
      and several hours, depending on the number of processors your machine
      has, and requires about 2 GB of free disk space. If you have a
      multi-processor machine, you can call <code>make -j4 target-name</code>
      to let <code>make</code> call multiple instances of the compiler 
      (in this case four). This speeds up compilation by about
      the factor given after <code>-j</code>, at least if you have as many
      processors.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <acronym>deal.II</acronym> libraries come in two versions
      corresponding to their respective targets:
      <ul>
	<li> 
	  <p><code>lib/libdeal_II.g</code>: This is the
	    debug version of the library. It is compiled with compiler flags so
	    that the library contains information that can be used by debuggers. (The
	    infix <code>.g</code> was historically chosen because gcc uses the
	    flag <code>-g</code> to request debugging information).
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    In addition, this library contains a great number of safety
	    checks on most arguments of all functions you could possibly call.
	    These assertions have proven to be an
	    invaluable means to finding programming bugs since they will
	    almost always abort your program if something goes wrong. In our
	    experience, more than ninety per cent of all errors are invalid
	    parameters (such as vectors having the wrong size, etc) and they
	    are usually found almost instantaneously displaying the file
	    name and line number of where the problem occurred.
	  </p>

	<li> <p><code>lib/libdeal_II</code>: This is the
	    optimized version of the library. You will want to link with it
	    once you know that your program is working as expected. This
	    version of the library does not contain the safety checks any more
	    and is compiled with aggressive compiler optimizations. The
	    resulting executables are smaller and will run between 2 and 10
	    times faster than the debug executables.
	  </p>
    </ul>
    Each library file will have a suffix that depends on the system.
    If static libraries were requested during
    configuration, then the suffix is <code>.a</code>. For shared
    libraries, it is <code>.so</code> (for most Unix-like and Linux
    systems), <code>.dylib</code> (for Mac OS X), or <code>.dll</code>
    (for Cygwin/Windows).
    </p>

    <p>
    Apart from the libraries, you should generate the full set of
    documentation files, by typing <code>make online-doc</code>; this takes
    some minutes but you will
    have (almost) all the documentation locally on your computer. You
    will then be able to access it through <a
    href="documentation.html" target="body">this page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    At this point, you have generated everything necessary to write
    programs based on <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. If you are new to
    <acronym>deal.II</acronym>, you may want to continue with the
    <a href="doxygen/tutorial/index.html" target="_top">tutorial</a>.

    <a name="configuration-options"></a>
    <h3>Configuration options</h3>

    <a name="choose-compiler"></a></a>
    <h4>Changing the compiler or compiler flags</h4>

    To instruct <code>configure</code> to use a particular compiler, there are two
    options: first, you can prepend your search path by the directory
    of the desired compiler. Alternatively, if your full compiler paths are
    <tt>mycc</tt> and <tt>myc++</tt> (for example) for your C and C++ compilers,
    respectively, type into your <tt>csh</tt>:
    <pre>
      setenv CC  mycc
      setenv CXX myc++
      ./configure
    </pre>
    or into your <tt>bash</tt>
    <pre>
      export CC=mycc
      export CXX=myc++
      ./configure
    </pre>

    <p>
    The paths to these compilers are stored in the
    <code>common/Make.global_options</code> files, so the compilers
    are always used when compiling the library even if the environment
    variables are not set later on any more (for example if you are working
    within another window, or have unset the variables for other
    purposes).
    </p>

    <p>
    If all you want to do is pass different compiler flags to the
    compiler, set the standard environment variables <code>CXXFLAGS,
    CFLAGS, LDFLAGS</code> before calling
    <code>./configure</code>. For example, to produce
    <code>gprof</code> output, do:
    <pre>
      setenv CXXFLAGS -pg
      setenv LDFLAGS -pg
      ./configure &lt;configure-options&gt;
    </pre>
    The flags so set are used for both optimized and debug mode. If you want to
    set flags for only one of these two cases, you should
    set <code>CXXFLAGSO</code> or <code>CXXFLAGSG</code>, respectively.
    </p>


    <a name="optional">
    <h4>Selecting optional behavior</h4></a>

    You can give several flags to ./configure:
    <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--enable-shared</code>: Compile the files of deal.II into
      shared libraries, rather than statically linked
      libraries. Enabling this option saves disk space, link time and
      start-up time, so this is the default. Some systems
      might not support shared libraries, in which case you should
      call ./configure with the parameter
      <code>--disable-shared</code>.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--enable-threads</code>: This flag indicates that those
      parts of the library that support this compute in parallel,
      using multiple threads, making programs significantly faster on
      machines with multiple cores or processors. The default is to
      use multiple threads since most machines today have several
      processor cores. If this is not desired,
      use <code>--disable-threads</code>.

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--enable-mpi</code>: If given this
      flag, <code>./configure</code> chooses <code>mpiCC</code>
      and <code>mpicc</code> as the C++ and C compilers, respectively,
      unless the <code>$CXX</code> and <code>$CC</code> environment
      variables have specifically been set to something else. If these
      compilers exist and indeed support MPI, then this also switches
      on support for MPI in the library.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--with-cpu=...</code>: Enable specific optimization
      flags for a particular processor. Programs compiled with these options
      might not execute on another system, but may be faster on the
      particular CPU selected.
      </p>

      <p>
      For a complete list of supported values of this switch, you may
      take a look at the file <code>aclocal.m4</code> in the top-level
      directory. However, the most commonly used value
      is <code>--with-cpu=native</code>, indicating that the compiler
      should determine the CPU we are running on by itself and
      optimize for it.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
      <code>--with-doxygen=...</code>: Select the specified executable
      of <code>doxygen</code> over the one automatically found by
      <code>./configure</code>. May also be used if no
      <code>doxygen</code> can be found automatically.
      </p>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <code>./configure</code> stores the paths to some
    programs, such as the compilers or the Perl interpreter. The
    compiler which will be used when compiling the library (or your
    own application) is therefore selected at the time of
    configuration and independent of the setting of your $PATH
    environment value at the time when you run <code>make</code>. If
    you want to change the compiler used, you will therefore have
    to re-run ./configure.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is in general a good idea to run <code>make clean</code>
    before re-configuring.
    </p>




    <a name="optional-software"></a>
    <h4>Optional interfaces to other software packages</h4>

    <p> <acronym>deal.II</acronym> comes with built-in support for a
      number of external software packages. These packages are
      sometimes detected automatically, sometimes they must be enabled explicitly
      during configuration by adding the option <tt>--with-package</tt>.
      Supported software packages are (the following list contains
      trademarks belonging to their owners):
    </p>

    <dl>
    <dt>TECPLOT</dt>
    <dd>Autodetected if one of the variables <tt>$TECHOME</tt>,
    <tt>$TEC80HOME</tt> or <tt>$TEC90HOME</tt> points to a valid installation
    of the tecio library. If enabled, allows data output in TECPLOT format.
    </dd>

    <a name="umfpack"></a>
    <dt>UMFPACK</dt>
    <dd>Enabled by <tt>--with-umfpack</tt>. If no argument is given,
    use the version of UMFPACK that comes bundled with <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. If you
    want a different version of UMFPACK, provide the path to that
    version as an argument. Enabling UMFPACK adds the
    class <tt>SparseDirectUMFPACK</tt> to the library. The default is to not
    use UMFPACK.

    <p>
    If you want to use an external installation of UMFPACK, but UMFPACK was
    installed as
    part of <code>/usr</code> or <code>/opt</code>, instead of local
    directories in a home directory for example, you can use configure
    switches <code>--with-umfpack-include, --with-umfpack-libs</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that UMFPACK has its own license; if
    you want to use it with deal.II, please read it and make sure that you
    agree with it. You can find the license of UMFPACK <a
    href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/">here</a>. We
    include UMFPACK in the deal.II distributions courtesy of its author,

      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> can interface to
      the <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/"
      target="_top">PETSc</a> library. The simplest way to do so is to
      set the <code>PETSC_DIR</code> and <code>PETSC_ARCH</code>
      environment variables. More information and configuration
      options can be found by issuing <code>./configure --help</code>
      at the command line, or, <a href="readme-petsc-trilinos.html"

      the <a href="http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/"
      target="_top">SLEPc</a> library. The way to do it is to set
      the <code>SLEPC_DIR</code> environment variable by
      passing <code>--with-slepc=/path/to/slepc</code>
      to <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s <code>./configure</code> script.
      The use of SLEPc is optional, however, for the interface with
      SLEPc to work at all, <acronym>deal.II</acronym>'s interface to
      PETSc must also be configured correctly (see the notes above on
      how to do this).

      <p>
      In order to generate partitionings of triangulations, we have
      functions that
      call <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/index.html"
      target="_top">METIS</a> library. METIS is a library that
      provides various methods to partition graphs, which we use to
      define which cell belongs to which part of a triangulation. The
      main point in using METIS is to generate partitions so that the
      interfaces between cell blocks are as small as possible. This
      data can, in turn, be used to distribute degrees of freedom onto
      different processors when using PETSc and/or SLEPc in parallel
      mode.
      </p>

      <p>
      As with PETSc and SLEPc, the use of METIS is optional. If you
      wish to use it, you can do so by having a METIS installation
      around at the time of calling
      <code>./configure</code> by either
      setting the <code>METIS_DIR</code> environment
      variable denoting the path to the METIS library, or using the
      <code>--with-metis</code> flag. If METIS was installed as part
      of <code>/usr</code> or <code>/opt</code>, instead of local directories
      in a home directory for example, you can use configure
      switches <code>--with-metis-include, --with-metis-libs</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
	On some systems, when using shared libraries for deal.II, you may get
	warnings of the kind <code>libmetis.a(pmetis.o): relocation R_X86_64_32
	  against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared
	  object; recompile with -fPIC</code> when linking. This can be
	avoided by recompiling METIS with <code>-fPIC</code> as a compiler
	flag.
      </p>

      <p>
	METIS is not needed when using <code>p4est</code> to parallelize
	programs, see below.

    </dd>

      <p>
	p4est is a library that <acronym>deal.II</acronym> uses to
	distribute very large meshes across multiple processors (think
	meshes with a billion cells on 10,000 processors). Using and
	installing p4est is discussed <a href="external-libs/p4est.html"
					 target="body">here</a>.
	To configure <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with p4est, you will
	need to use the <code>--with-path=/path/to/path</code>
	switch to the <code>./configure</code> script.
      </p>

    <a name="blas"></a>
    <dt>BLAS, LAPACK</dt>

    <dd> <p>If <code>--with-blas=blasname</code> and/or
    <code>--with-lapack=lapackname</code> is given, provide wrappers
    around some of the BLAS and LAPACK functions, and link with the
    respective libraries. It will make sure that we link with the
    required FORTRAN libraries. If no argument is given to
    <code>--with-blas</code>, then a BLAS library
    <code>libblas.a</code> or <code>libblas.so</code> is searched for
    in the default locations of your system, and similarly for LAPACK.</p>

    <p>If your BLAS or LAPACK libraries are not in the standard search
    path of your linker, you have to tell the linker where to find them.
    The path is not given as an argument to
    <code>--with-blas</code>. Rather, you set the variable
    <code>LDFLAGS</code> accordingly or make sure that the path is in
    your <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> or similar. For details, please
    look up the documentation of your linker. An example configuration
    for Linux is:</p>
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-blas=myblas LDFLAGS=-L/my/lib/
    </pre>
    <p> This example will search for a library
    <code>libmyblas.a</code> or <code>libmyblas.so</code> in the
    directory <code>/my/lib</code> and elsewhere in the system library
    paths.</p>

    <p>Some versions of BLAS and LAPACK need additional libraries
    to be linked with. Such an example is the
    <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">automatically tuned
    linear algebra software (ATLAS)</a>. The BLAS version of this
    package also needs declarations from <code>libatlas.a</code>,
    so it must be included. Using the standard library names of
    atlas, the include for BLAS reads
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-blas='f77blas -latlas'
    </pre>
    assuming that the library files <code>libf77blas.a</code> and
    <code>libatlas.a</code> or the respective shared libraries
    <code>*.so</code> are in libraries included in
    <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>. LAPACK generated by ATLAS is
    included in a similar fashion.</p>
