          <strong>2010/06/24: step-39 solves Poisson's equation with
          the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method on
          adaptively refined meshes with multigrid</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Using the MeshWorker framework, this program highlights the
          fact that loops over meshes are very generic and that
          building matrices and level matrices and evaluating error
          estimates are really the same task.
      </dd>

      <dt>
	<strong> 2010/06/24: The Meshworker framework has been released</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	Using its generic loop and the provided auxiliary classes,
	this framework relieves the application programmer from coding
	loops over cells, faces, and subfaces, such that focus can remain
	on implementation of the local integrals.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>
          <strong>2010/06/23: step-37 shows periodic boundary
          conditions</strong> 
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Contributed by Markus B&uuml;rg, the new tutorial program step-37
          demonstrates an often requested feature: periodic boundary
          conditions.
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2010/02/13: New multigrid, new step-16</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Over the last few months, the multigrid implementation has seen
          significant rewrites, with much of the work done by B&auml;rbel
          Janssen. The goal &mdash; now achieved &mdash; was to finally fully
          support multigrid also for continuous finite elements on adaptively
          refined meshes (uniformly refined meshes and discontinuous elements
          have worked for a long time). As part of this process, step-16 has
          been rewritten and now solves the same problem step-6 solves, just
          with a multigrid solver.
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2009/10/07: step-35 shows the solution of the
          Navier-Stokes equations</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Step-35, a tutorial program contributed by Abner
          Salgado-Gonzalez, shows an implementation of a projection
          scheme for the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes
          equations.
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2009/07/30: New tutorial program step-36</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The new step-36 tutorial program, contributed by Toby D. Young and
          Wolfgang Bangerth, shows how to solve eigenvalue problems, using the
          Schr&ouml;dinger equation as an example.

          <strong style="color:red">2009/06/05: Version 6.2.1 released</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          deal.II version 6.2.0 contained a couple of minor but
          annoying bugs in its interaction with PETSc. The
          documentation package also did not include any typeset
          formulas. Release 6.2.1 corrects these mistakes.

      </dt>
      <dd>
          step-34, written by Luca Heltai, demonstrates the ability of
          deal.II to discretize and solve boundary integral equations
          on curved manifolds.
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2008/12/05: Support for meshes embedded in
	    higher dimensions</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Based on work by Cataldo Manigrasso and Luca Heltai
          developed over the last few months on a branch, deal.II now
          supports meshes that are embedded in higher space
          dimensions. This allows, for example, to solve equations on
          the surface of a sphere (e.g. to use boundary element
          methods for exterior problems).
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2008/11/14: New tutorial program step-31</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          The latest tutorial program, step-31, is contributed by
          Martin Kronbichler and Wolfgang Bangerth and shows the
          solution of the Boussinesq approximation to thermally driven
          convection in an incompressible fluid.
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2008/09/10: New tutorial program step-28</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          step-28, contributed by Yaqi Wang, illustrates the solution
          of a coupled system of diffusion equations relevant to
          nuclear reactor physics where we use different meshes for
          different components of a vector-valued solution.
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2008/08/21: <acronym>deal.II</acronym> now exceeds
          of 400,000 lines of code</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Since today, <acronym>deal.II</acronym> has more than 400,000
          lines of code. The rate of growth continues to be close on
          par with the 3000 lines of code per month that we have had
          over many years already, with no signs of abating activity!

      <dt>
          <strong>2008/05/23: step-33 illustrates the Euler equations</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_33.html">step-33</a>,
          a tutorial program written mostly by David Neckels, illustrates how
          the Euler equations of compressible inviscid gas dynamics can be
          solved. More generally, the program also provides a framework for
          the solution of arbitrary hyperbolic, nonlinear conservation laws.

      <dd>
          The new <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_22.html">step-22</a>
          tutorial program, written by Martin Kronbichler and Wolfgang
          Bangerth, shows how to solve, and in particular how to solve
          efficiently, the Stokes equations that describe viscous
          incompressible fluid flow.

      <dt>
          <strong>2007/10/31: step-29 tutorial program added</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Contributed by Moritz Allmaras, the <a
          href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_29.html">step-29</a> tutorial program
          explains how problems involving complex numbers can be treated in
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. In the example,
          the complex-valued solution to a Helmholtz equation is split into
          real and imaginary parts and a vector-valued finite element field
          is used to discretize them seperately. The program also demonstrates
          how quantities derived from the finite element solution can be directly
          included in the output by using the new <code>DataPostprocessor</code>
          class.

      <dd>
          The new <a href="../doxygen/deal.II/step_27.html">step-27</a>
          tutorial program finally demonstrates how to use the
	  hp finite element technology that has been part of deal.II for some
	  18 months now. It solves a Laplace equation with hp finite elements
	  and shows how to set finite element degrees, assemble matrices on
	  cells with varying polynomial degrees, and how to compute a simple
	  criterion for estimating the local Sobolev smoothness of a function.

          <strong>2007/02/09: Support for previously unorientable meshes</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Up to now, in 3D only 'orientable' meshes could be used in
          deal.II, where all lines are in standard orientation and the
          faces can be either in standard orientation or with a
          reversed normal. This has been generalized such that now all
          hexahedral meshes can be used.

      <dt>
          <strong>2006/10/30: step-21 is finished</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Step-21 demonstrates the time dependent flow of a multiphase fluid
	  through a porous medium. It is an extension of step-20, using a mixed
	  formulation and block solvers.
      </dd>

      <dt>
          <strong>2006/10/03: step-23/24/25 are finished</strong>

      </dt>
      <dd>
          A modified version of the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library and the
	  step-14 tutorial program has been incorporated into the industry
	  standard <a href="http://www.spec.org/cpu2006/" target="_top">SPEC CPU 2006</a>
	  benchmark testsuite that is used to determine the speed of
	  computers. It is part of the floating point testsuite <a

      </dt>
      <dd>
          The new step-20 tutorial program shows how to use Raviart-Thomas
	  elements to solve a mixed formulation of the Laplace equation. It
	  also demonstrates the use of block matrices and vectors, and how they
	  can be used to define more complex solvers and preconditioners
	  working on the Schur complement.
