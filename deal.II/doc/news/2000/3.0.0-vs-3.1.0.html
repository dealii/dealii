<h2>Changes between Versions 3.0 and 3.1</h2>

This is a quite extensive list of changes made after the release of 
<acronym>deal.II</acronym> version 3.0. It is subdivided into changes
made to the three sub-libraries <a href="#base">base</a>, 
<a href="#lac">lac</a>, and <a href="#deal.II">deal.II</a>, as well as
changes to the <a href="#general">general infrastructure,
documentation, etc</a>.



<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: All identifiers that the C++ standard (see
       <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/dec96pub/"
       target="_top"> this page</a> for the public draft -- the
       standard itself is not available online for copyright reasons)
       mandates to be in namespace <code>std::</code> are correctly
       prefixed by the namespace name. While previous gcc compilers
       accepted these names also without the prefix, gcc 3.0 will
       require them, as do some commercial compilers.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: In multithreading mode, the compile flags now also have 
       <code class="program">_REENTRANT</code> defined. If this flag
       is defined, then the standard Unix headers also declare
       reentrant versions (with suffix <code class="program">_r</code>)
       of many functions.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/09/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Major and minor version numbers of the
       <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library are now passed to the
       compiler as preprocessor variables
       <code class="program">DEAL_2_MAJOR</code> and
       <code class="program">DEAL_2_MINOR</code>. Their present values
       are 3 and 1, respectively. Variables of the same name are also
       available in Makefiles.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/09/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code class="program">step-9</code> example program is
       now ready, showing several advanced programming techniques in
       <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/07/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: <acronym>deal.II</acronym> now uses the 
       <code class="program">kdoc2</code> program to generate the API
       documentation. This makes up for much nices documentation and
       also works better than the previous <code class="program">kdoc1</code>.
       A copy of <code class="program">kdoc2</code> is provided within
       the <acronym>deal.II</acronym> source tree.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: when compiling files, the output generated by the
       <code class="program">make</code> program now indicates also
       whether we are compiling for multithread mode, besides the
       information whether the file is compiled for debug or optimized
       mode.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/06/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the 
       <code class="program">common/scripts/make_dependencies.pl</code> 
       script that sets up the dependencies for the make files had a
       problem when the path to the library included special characters
       such as `+'. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code class="program">configure</code> script now
       checks whether the <code>getrusage</code> function is properly
       declared (this function is used in the timer class). The
       problem is that on SunOS 4.x, this function exists, but is not
       declared in the right file (although it is listed in the man
       pages). We then have to declare it ourselves.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code class="program">configure</code> script now
       enforces the compiler flags <code>-ansi -pedantic</code> when
       compiling in debug mode. This should force us to write more
       standard compliant code. (Since the ACE library is not
       standards conforming, the <code>-ansi</code> flag is not used
       when multithreading is requested.)
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: the <code class="program">configure</code> script is
       now used to select the compiler options. Previously, selection
       of compiler options was done both in 
       <code class="program">configure</code> as well as in the global
       options Makefile 
       <code class="program">common/Make.global_options</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Dependence on the files 
       <code class="file">forward_declarations.h</code> has been widely
       removed to improve compilation time
       <br>
       (GK 2000/05/24)
       </p>


  <li> <p>
       Fix: <code class="program">configure</code> now uses 
       <code class="program">config.guess</code> to determine the
       operating system and hardware platform.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: License is now <acronym>deal.II</acronym> Public
       License, restricting commercial use more explicitely.
       <br>
       (WB/RH/GK)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: exceptions <code class="class">ExcIO</code> and <code
       class="class">ExcOutOfMemory</code> are defined globally now.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">ParameterHandler</code> now has a
       function <code class="member">log_parameters</code> which
       allows output of all parameters to a log file.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: almost all classes that store data now have a function
       <code class="member">memory_consumption</code> that returns an
       estimate of the amount of memory (in bytes) used up by this
       class. Supporting functions to compute the size of STL vectors
       and other objects can be found the 
       <code class="class">MemoryConsumption</code> namespace.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/11/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Class <code class="class">FunctionDerivative</code>
       computes finite difference approximations of a directional
       derivative of a <code class="class">Function</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/11/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code class="class">DataOutBase</code> and
       <code class="class">DataOutBase::Patch</code> classes have been
       changed so as to allow output of objects that have an other
       dimension than the surrounding space, for example writing faces
       instead of cells (this might be useful to write only external
       faces in 3d computations).
       <br>
       (WB 2000/09/07)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       New: There is a new <code class="member">distance</code> function
       in the <code class="class">Point</code> class that calculates the
       distance between two points.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/09/06)
       </p>   

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code class="class">Timer</code> now uses the system
       function <code class="member">getrusage (RUSAGE_CHILDREN,
       .)</code> that is need in multithreading. But still the <code
       class="class">Timer</code> class does not yet work in
       multithreading, as getrusage with flag RUSAGE_CHILDREN gives always
       0 (at least on Solaris7).
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/08/25)
       </p>   

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now a set of functions
       <code class="member">outer_product</code> that for the outer
       product of tensors.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/07/23)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       New: The classes 
       <code class="class">Patterns::Integer</code>
       and <code class="class">Patterns::Double</code> now allow that
       a range may be specified in which the parameter shall
       be. Furthermore, instead of a class,
       <code class="class">Patterns</code> is now a namespace, so it
       can be reopened in case you want to write another pattern class
       and want to put it into the same namespace.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/07/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: classes <code class="class">QMilne</code> and <code
       class="class">QWeddle</code> for closed Newton-Cotes-formul&aelig; of
       orders 7 and 9, respectively.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function <code class="member">invert
       (Tensor<2,dim>)</code> that returns the inverse of a tensor of
       rank 2.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New multithreading scheme is implemented.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">Subscriptor</code> prints the
       real class name if a subscribed object is deleted.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/12)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code class="class">SparseILU</code> had two bugs which
       are now fixed.
       <br>
       (<a href="mailto:or@winfos.com">Oliver Rheinbach</a>, 2001/02/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: block classes have a variable number of blocks now,
       not a template parameter.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">BlockDiagonalMatrix</code> is a
       template that generates a matrix with multiple copies of the
       same block on the diagonal.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>

       Improved: Krylov-space solvers do not use the function residual
       anymore. This allows easier implementation of new matrix
       classes. <code class="class">SolverGMRES</code> now also counts
       the first iteration step. Finally, all solvers inherit a <code
       class="class">Subscriptor</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions 
       <code class="member">SparsityPattern::symmetrize</code> and
       <code class="member">SparseMatrix::symmetrize</code> that
       generate a symmetric matrix from a non-symmetric one.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/12/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: almost all classes that store data now have a function
       <code class="member">memory_consumption</code> that returns an
       estimate of the amount of memory (in bytes) used up by this
       class.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/11/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code class="member">
       SparseMatrix<number>::n_actually_nonzero_elements</code>
       returns the number of entries that are actually nonzero.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/11/22)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: unlike announced in the docs, the
       <code class="member">FullMatrix::norm2</code> function did not
       return the Frobenius norm of a matrix, but its square. This is
       fixed now.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/08/28)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">PreconditionBlockSOR</code><code
       class="member">::Tvmult(...)</code> is implemented.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The breakdown criterion of <code
       class="class">SolverBicgstab</code> can be changed by the use
       of <code class="class">SolverBicgstab::AdditionalData</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/07/07)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">SolverRichardson</code> has a
       transposed solver <code class="member">Tsolve(...)</code>. It
       uses the functions <code class="member">Tvmult(...)</code> of
       the provided matrix and preconditioner.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code class="class">FullMatrix</code><code
       class="member">::invert(...)</code> now inverts matrices of all
       sizes. If there is no hardcoded inversion, <code
       class="member">gauss_jordan()</code> is used implicitly.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: For recognizing a diverging solver before the maximum
       number of steps is reached, 
       <code class="class">SolverControl</code> returns 
       <code class="member">failure</code> also if the residual
       increases over the start residual by a specific factor. This
       factor is given to the <code class="class">SolverControl</code> 
       object by the <code class="member">set_failure_criterion</code>
       function. After calling the latter function, checking of this
       additional failure criterion may again be disabled by calling
       <code class="member">clear_failure_criterion</code>.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/06/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The interface of preconditioner classes has changed.
       Preconditioners are now considered linear operators like
       matrices: they have members <code class="member">vmult</code>
       and <code class="member">Tvmult</code> instead of the old <code
       class="member">operator()</code>. This will allow the
       implementation of further non-symmetric solvers.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/06/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: there is now a function
       <code class="member">SparseMatrix::el</code> that does mostly
       the same as <code class="member">SparseMatrix::operator()</code>,
       but returns a zero if elements of the matrix are accessed that
       are not in the sparsity pattern. Thus, the new function allows
       to actually traverse rows or columns of the matrix without
       taking care of the sparsity pattern, while
       <code class="member">SparseMatrix::operator()</code> should be
       used to write algorithms more efficiently.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: 
       <code class="member">SparsityPattern::print_gnuplot</code>
       wrote rows and columns exchanged. Since most matrices have
       symmetric sparsity patterns, this has gone unnoticed by now.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the 
       <code class="member">FullMatrix::Tvmult</code> function
       suffered from the same problems as the
       <code class="member">FullMatrix::Tmmult</code> function. This
       is now fixed as well.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Class <code class="class">PreconditionBlockJacobi</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/05/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">SolverControl</code> has an interface
       to <code class="class">ParameterHandler</code>, definining and
       reading parameters from a file automatically.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/05/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">BlockIndices</code>: Class that
       manages the conversion of global indices into a block
       vector/matrix/... to the indices local to each of the blocks. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/08)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">BlockSparsityPattern</code> and
       <code class="class">BlockSparseMatrix</code>: Classes that
       represent matrices that are composed of sparse matrices.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/08)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the 
       <code class="member">FullMatrix::mmult</code> and
       <code class="member">FullMatrix::Tmmult</code> code don't
       resize their output argument any more, as this is not common
       style in the library. Furthermore, 
       <code class="member">FullMatrix::Tmmult</code> was utterly
       broken. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Change: the <code class="member">matrix_norm</code> functions
       of sparse and full matrices are renamed to 
       <code class="member">matrix_norm_square</code>, since they in
       fact return the square of the norm. This should avoid confusion
       in some cases.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the ``copy-like'' constructor of 
       <code class="class">SparsityPattern</code> that copies another
       object and adds some off-diagonals had a bug that caused an
       exception in some cases. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">SwappableVector</code>: Class that
       allows to swap out the data of a vector to disk and reload it
       later on. It also has a function to preload the data before its
       use in a separate thread if the library is configured for
       multi-threading.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: there are now functions <code class="member">Vector::swap</code> 
       and <code class="member">BlockVector::swap</code>, as well as
       global functions <code class="member">swap(u,v)</code> that
       exchange the data of two vectors without needing a temporary
       vector and without copying around data. Their run-time is
       therefore independent of the length of the vectors.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: <code class="class">SolverCG</code> counts steps properly.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Change: the solver classes in LAC lost their first template
       argument. Their names are now 
       <code class="class">SolverXX&lt;VECTOR&gt;</code>, where
       <code class="class">XX</code> denotes the name of the solver
       (e.g. CG, GMRES, etc). Furthermore, the
       inheritance from <code class="class">Solver</code> was made private
       to reflect the logical structure.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">EigenInverse</code> implements inverse
       iteration by Wieland.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="class">EigenPower</code> implements power
       method by von Mises
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code class="member">PreconditionBlockSOR::set_omega</code>
       allows to change the relaxation parameter.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/12)
       </p>

       New: <code class="class">SolverXX</code>: There is a virtual function

       Extend: <code class="member">DoFTools::extract_boundary_dofs</code>

  <li> <p>
       New: some arguments of the functions

       function now eliminates vertices from the input that are not
       referenced by any of the cells in the input file. This makes is
       simpler to delete some cells from the input file by hand,
       without the need to update the vertex lists, which can be
       tiring as several cells usually use each vertex. All functions
       in the <code class="class">GridIn</code> reading grids in

  <li> <p>
       Removed: The 
       <code class="class">DataOut_Old</code> class has finally gone for
       good. It was already deprecated in version 3.0, and has been
       superceded for a long time by the framwork of classes around

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function
       <code class="member">DoFHandler::n_boundary_dofs</code>
       that takes the list of selected boundary indicators as a

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The

       functions have been moved from the <code class="class">DoFHandler</code>
       to the <code class="class">DoFTools</code> class, in order to

       New: there is now a class <code class="class">DataOutRotation</code>
       that can be used to output data which has been computed
       exploiting rotational symmetry, on the original domain. Thus,
       the output is of one dimension higher than the computation was,
       where the computed solution is rotated around the axis of
       symmetry.

       and
       <code
       class="member">Triangulation::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number</code>
       have been moved from the triangulation class to a separate
       class <code class="class">GridRefinement</code> as they are not
       intricately bound to the triangulation but rather form a
       distinct class of functions that flag cells for refinement or

       New: <code class="member">DataOut::clear_input_data_references</code>
       clears all reference to input data vectors and to the <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code>. This function may be useful
       after the patches have been built, to release memory as early
       as possible, in this case before the output is actually written.

  <li> <p>
       Fix: Add a missing assertions in <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::get_function_*</code>. If an <code
       class="class">ExcAccessToUninitializedField</code> is now thrown
       then probably an <code class="member">update_values</code> or
       <code class="member">update_gradients</code> is missing in the
       <code class="class">UpdateFlags</code> of a used <code
       class="class">FEValues</code>. Adding this assertion uncovered
       several other errors which are now also fixed; these errors
       were dormant, since the values of finite elements are always
       computed for the presently available Lagrange elements, but
       would have been activated once there are other classes of

       is a new mesh smoothing. A mesh of patch level 1 consists of

       least once.

  <li> <p>
       Changed: the 
       <code class="member">MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values</code>
       now uses a much faster algorithm when working on matrices with
       symmetric sparsity patterns. On the other hand, it does no more
       eliminate whole rows when a matrix has a non-symmetric sparsity
       pattern, or if the user (through a new flag) tells the function
       that this is not necessary, for example if the matrix itself is
       non-symmetric. 
       </p>

       <p>
       For symmetric sparsity patterns, the algorithm now eliminates
       each boundary value in O(m*log(m)) steps instead of
       O(N*log(m)), where N=number of rows of the matrix, and m=number
       of entries per row. Note that m is roughly constant,
       irrespective of N, so the old algorithm became slower with
       finer grids, while the new one is O(1) for each boundary degree
       of freedom.
