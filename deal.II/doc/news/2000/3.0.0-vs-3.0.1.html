<h2>Changes between versions 3.0 and 3.0.1</h2>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fix: in three space dimensions, the triangulation class
       over-estimated the necessary amount of memory needed upon
       refinement and allocated too much.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: getting the support points from system finite elements
       (class <code class="class">FESystem</code>) resulted in an
       exception. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: <code class="member">FullMatrix::Tmmult</code> and
       <code class="member">FullMatrix::Tvmult</code> were broken.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/08 and 2000/05/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: slight bug in 
       <code class="member">DataOut::build_patches</code>
       in multithreaded mode fixed.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann, 2000/05/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: 
       <code class="member">SparsityPattern::print_gnuplot</code>
       wrote rows and columns exchanged. Since most matrices have
       symmetric sparsity patterns, this has gone unnoticed by now.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the 
       <code class="program">common/scripts/make_dependencies.pl</code> 
       script that sets up the dependencies for the make files had a
       problem when the path to the library included special characters
       such as `+'. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/15)
       </p>
</ol>
