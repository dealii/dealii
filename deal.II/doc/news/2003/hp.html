This is the list of changes made on the hp branch; this list will be merged
back into the main document listing changes once the hp branch is merged as
well. Since the hp branch only exists in the deal.II subdirectory, only this
category exists below.

  <li> <p>
       Changed:
       Changed <code class="class">FE</code> to
       <code class="class">FECollection</code> at several places and
       also changed depending functions accordingly. Modified the
       <code class="member">reserve_space</code> method of
       <code class="class">hpDoFHandler</code> to work for 2D
       DG-problems. In this context the 2D code for
       <code class"member">pre_refinement_notification</code> was
       added as well.

       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: 
       Implemented a couple of small modifications to get a first 1D
       hp-example running. The <code class="class">Triangulation</code>
       class was extended by a method to add
       <code class="class">RefinementListener</code>s, which allow
       other classes to be informed about Refinements. This is
       needed for the <code class="class">hpDoFHandler</code>, which
       administrates the <code class="member">active_fe_indices</code>
       in the <code class="class">hpDoFLevel</code>s. Once this
       was implemented, the other changes were straightforward. For
       1D, the only thing which had to be changed for hp was the
       <code class="member">reserve_space</code> method.
       Last but not least, for the hp-example the
       <code class="member">add</code> method was added to the
       <code class="class">FECollection</code>. It allows the user to
       add new <code class="class">FiniteElements</code>s to the
       the <code class="class">FECollection</code>.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2003/06/1)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Introduced the <code class="class">DoFHandler</code>
       as template parameter in classes <code class="class">DataOutStack</code>,
       <code class="class">DataOutFaces</code>, <code class="class">DataOut</code> and 
       <code class="class">DataOut_DoFData</code>.
       <code class="class">DoFHandler</code> is used as default
       template argument to ensure backward compatibility. Added
       an overloaded method <code class="member">reinit</code> for the
       new <code class="class">hpDoFHandler</code> in class
       <code class="class">FEValues</code>. Modified method
       <code class="member">interpolate_boundary_values</code> in
       class <code class="class">VectorTools</code> to take the
       <code class="class">DoFHandler</code> as template
       argument. Probably this method must be changed later, when the real
       <code class="class">hpDoFHandler</code> is implemented. Added
       the first implementation of the
       <code class="class">hpDoFHandler</code> which is simply a copy
       of the old one. But it should provide a good basis for the new
       one. Finally the <code class="class">DoFAccessor</code> is now
       instantiated for the new
       <code class="class">hpDoFAccessor</code>. Overall these changes
       now allow the compilation of some of the sample programs with
       the new <code class="class">hpDoFAccessor</code> but obviously
       not yet with new functionality.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2003/02/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code class="member">DoFHandler::n_boundary_dofs</code>
       functions have been moved and renamed. They are now
       <code class="member">DoFTools::count_boundary_dofs</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code class="class">DoFLevel</code> classes has been moved to
       a namespace <code class="class">internal</code>, since they are not
       meant for public use.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Many of the functions in <code class="class">DoFTools</code>
       are now templatized to accept both <code class="class">DoFHandler</code>
       and <code class="class">hpDoFHandler</code> objects.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code class="class">TriaDimensionInfo</code> and
       <code class="class">DoFDimensionInfo</code> classes that were used to
       declare typedefs for the iterators have been moved to a namespace
       internal (so as to get them out of the class index in the documentation
       -- these classes were not meant for use in applications after all), and
       have been renamed to <code class="class">TriaIteratorSelector</code>
       and <code class="class">DoFIteratorSelector</code>, since that is what
       they are.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Due to the demand for different <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code> classes (mainly for the planned
       hp-DoFHandler) the DoFHandler has been introduced as a
       template parameter into the <code class="class">DoFAccessor</code>,
       the <code class="class">DoFObjectAccessor</code>,
       and the <code class="class">DoFCellAccessor</code> classes.
       Furthermore the <code class="class">DoFHandler</code> was
       also introduced as template parameter into the
       <code class="class">DoFDimensionInfo</code>
       class. These changes induced several little changes in a couple
       of methods to get the code through the compiler. But no
       functionality was affected.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2003/01/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: There are now overloaded versions of the <code
       class="member">FEValues::reinit</code> function (and likewise in the
       <code class="class">FEFaceValues</code> and <code
       class="class">FESubFaceValues</code> classes) that either take a
       <code class="member">Triangulation::cell_iterator</code> or a
       <code class="member">DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code>. That means that
       you can compute certain data with only the geometrical information the
       former provides, independent of whether degrees of freedom are
       associated with this cell or not. However, certain functions of the
       <code class="class">FEValues</code> class will throw an error if you
       attempt to use them without DoF data being delivered in the
       reinitialization call; these functions need to extract values from
       finite element fields, and are mostly the
       <code
       class="member">FEValues::get_function_values/grads/2nd_derivatives</code>
       functions.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">Mapping::transform_real_to_unit_cell</code> and
       <code class="member">Mapping::transform_unit_to_real_cell</code>
       now only take a <code class="member">Triangulation::cell_iterator</code>
       instead of a <code class="member">DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code> as
       previously. This is also reasonable, since they only need the geometric
       information.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code class="member">FiniteElement::fill_fe_*_values</code>
       now only take a <code class="member">Triangulation::cell_iterator</code>
       instead of a <code class="member">DoFHandler::cell_iterator</code> as
       previously. Likewise for <code
       class="member">FiniteElementBase::compute_2nd</code> and <code
       class="member">FESystem::compute_fill</code>, and the 
       <code class="member">Mapping::fill_fe_*_values</code> functions.
       <br>
