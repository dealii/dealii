<h2>Changes between the main branch and the anisotropic branch</h2>

<p>
This is the list of changes between the main cvs branch and the
anisotropic branch of <acronym>deal.II</acronym> library. It is
subdivided into changes made to the three sub-libraries <a
href="#base">base</a>, <a href="#lac">lac</a>, and <a
href="#deal.II">deal.II</a>, as well as changes to the <a
href="#general">general infrastructure, documentation, etc</a>.

<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the extension of the library to anisotropic
refinement.
</p>


<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Changed: <code class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">children_per_cell</code> has been replaced by
       <code class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">max_children_per_cell</code>, which represents
       the maximum number of children a cell might have, i.e. the
       number of children in the case of isotropic refinement. But
       note, that this number will rarely be needed in user codes. In
       general, the number of children of a cell varies from cell to
       cell and can be obtained by <code>cell->n_children()</code>,
       which gives the number of children of a specific
       <code>cell</code> which is refined iso- or anisotropically.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The analogous change applies to the number of children
       of a face. <code class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">subfaces_per_face</code> has been replaced by
       <code class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">max_children_per_face</code>, which represents
       the maximum number of children a face might have, i.e. the
       number of children in the case of an isotropic refined face.
       But note, that this number will rarely be needed in user
       codes. In general, the number of children of a face varies from
       face to face and can be obtained by
       <code>face->n_children()</code>, which gives the number of
       children of a specific <code>face</code> which is refined iso-
       or anisotropically.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">child_cell_on_face</code> is generalized to
       anisotropic refinement and has now an additional
       <code>RefineCase::Type</code> argument. This function will
       rarely be used in user codes, as e.g. the neighbor's child at a
       specific face and subface should be accessed through
       <code>cell->neighbor_child_on_subface</code> rather than
       through the <code class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">child_cell_on_face</code> function.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/02/27)
       </p>
</ol>


<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New but temporarily: A global
       <code>anisotropic_refinement</code> flag has been introduced
       (defined in <code>geometry_info.h</code>, initialized in
       <code>data_out_base.cc</code>) indicating whether an
       anisotropic refinement has been performed or not. This flag is
       checked throughout the code and throws an exception in all
       parts of the library which are not yet generalized to
       anisotropic refinement. This flag can be removed once
       anisotropic refinement is fully incorporated into deal.II.

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Changed: When allowing anisotropic refinement it cannot be
       garantueed that all children of a cell are stored in
       consecutive components of the <code>quads.quads</code> or the
       <code>hexes.hexes</code> vector, respectively. It is only known
       that children are stored at least in pairs. Therefore, it is
       not sufficient any more to store the index of the first child
       of a cell, only. Now the indices of every second child, i.e. of
       the even numbered children, must be stored.  For this, the
       <code>cell-></code><code class="member">set_children</code>
       function now has a new argument representing the number of the
       child for which the index shall be set. This function can only
       be called for even numbered children. The same applies to the
       <code>face-></code><code class="member">set_children</code>
       function.
       <br> 
       Finally, we note that these functions are for internal use,
       only.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/03/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>cell-></code><code
       class="member">refine_flag_set</code> function now returns a
       <code>RefineCase::Type</code> argument instead of a boolean. Be
       aware, that you now still can ask
       <code>if(!cell->refine_flag_set())</code> ,
       <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set()==false)</code> and
       <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set())</code> , but you cannot ask
       <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set()==true)</code> any more.  <br>
       (RH 2005/03/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: The <code>cell-></code><code
       class="member">set_refine_flag</code> function now has a new
       <code>RefineCase::Type</code> argument which defaults to <code
       class="class">GeometryInfo&lt;dim&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">isotropic_refinement</code>.  <br> (RH
       2005/03/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code
       class="class">GeometryInfo&lt;dim&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">isotropic_refinement</code> variable of type
       <code>RefineCase::Type</code> representing the isotropic
       refinement case in <code>dim</code> dimensions,
       i.e. <code>GeometryInfo&lt;1&gt;::isotropic_refinement=RefineCase::cut_x</code>,
       <code>GeometryInfo&lt;2&gt;::isotropic_refinement=RefineCase::cut_xy</code>
       and
       <code>GeometryInfo&lt;3&gt;::isotropic_refinement=RefineCase::cut_xyz</code>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/03/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new enum <code>RefineCase::Type</code>
       defined in <code>geometry_info.h</code>, which allows to
       describe all possible (anisotropic and isotropic) refinement
       cases in (1,) 2 and 3 dimensions.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code
       class="class">TriaObjectAccessor</code>::<code
       class="member">n_children</code> function which returns the
       number of children of the cell or face it was invoked for.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code
       class="class">TriaObjectAccessor</code>::<code
       class="member">refine_case</code> function which returns the
       <code>RefineCase::Type</code> a cell or face is refined with.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code
       class="class">TriaObjectAccessor</code>::<code
       class="member">set_refine_case</code> function. This function
       is mainly for internal use (required by <code
       class="class">Triangulation</code>::<code
       class="member">execute_coarsening_and_refinement</code>). It is
       not provided for <code>dim=1</code> as there the refinement
       case defaults to isotropic refinement.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: New <code>vector&lt;RefineCase::Type&gt;
       refine_cases</code> vectors have been introduced in <code
       class="class">TriangulationLevel&lt;2&gt;::QuadsData</code> and
       <code
       class="class">TriangulationLevel&lt;3&gt;::HexesData</code>. For
       memory efficiency (but with a penalty on run-time) they might
       be replaced by <code>vector&lt;vector&lt;bool&gt; &gt; (dim,
       vector&lt;bool&gt; (n_quads/n_hexes))</code>, later.
