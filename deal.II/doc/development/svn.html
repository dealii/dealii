  <h1>Documentation of the deal.II SVN Archive</h1>

  <h2>The global structure</h2>


  The root of the deal.II archive is located
  at <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/">http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/</a>.
  There are three subdirectories:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/">trunk</a>:
      This is the location of the current development version; it contains the
    directories <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/deal.II">deal.II</a> 
    with the library proper
    and <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/tests">tests</a>
    with the testsuite.

    <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/tags/">tags</a>:
    contains released versions. They have the same
    structure as the trunk.

    <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/">branches</a>:
    currently active branches; it also has subdirectories:
      <ul>
	<li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/releases">releases</a>:
	branches for releases of deal.II
	  <li> <a href="http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/retired">retired</a>:
	  development branches that have been merged into the
	  trunk and are no longer used.
	    </ul>
      </ul>

  <h2>Creating a development branch</h2>

  Significant new functionality can often not be developed all at once. In a
  case like this, one can create a development branch in the subversion
  repository into which one can check in all necessary changes and from which
  one can merge the final set of changes into the main development line once
  ready. The <tt>svnmerge</tt> program can be used
  to keep your branch up-to-date with the trunk.

  <p>
    Creating a branch works through the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li> Create the branch using
      <pre>
	svn copy http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/trunk/ http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/new-branch-name
      </pre>
    <li> Either check out the new branch or switch your working copy by
      <pre>
	svn switch http://www.dealii.org/svn/dealii/branches/new-branch-name
      </pre>
      This command assumes you are in the top level directory, the one
      containing <tt>deal.II</tt> and <tt>tests</tt>
    <li> Initialize the merge tracking svnmerge: in the top level directory, call
      <pre>
	svnmerge.py init
	svn ci -F svnmerge-commit-message.txt
	rm svnmerge-commit-message.txt
      </pre>
      This should be done before making any local changes!
  </ol>
