<h3>Test Problem</h3>
The algorithms used above are tested against a traditional topology optimization
 problem called the Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm Beam (MBB Beam).

This problem considers the optimal 2-d structure that can be built on a
rectangle 6 units wide, and 1 unit tall. The bottom corners are fixed in place
in the $y$ direction using a zero Dirichlet boundary condition, and a downward
force is applied in the center of the top of the beam by enforcing a Neumann
boundary condition. The rest of the boundary is allowed to move, and has no
external force applied, which takes the form of a zero Neumann boundary
condition. In essence, we are asking the following question: How should we
design a bridge in a way so that if the bottom left and bottom right point of
the bridge are on rollers that allow these points to move horizontally but not
vertically, and so that the displacement in response to the vertical force in
the center is minimal.

While the total volume of the domain is 6 units, 3 units of material are allowed for
the structure. Because of the symmetry of the problem, it could be posed on a
rectangle of width 3 and height 1 by cutting the original domain in half, and
using zero Dirichlet boundary conditions in the $x$ direction along the cut
edge. That said, symmetry of the solution is a good indicator that the program
is working as expected, so we solved the problem on the whole domain,
as shown below. @cite Bendse2004

Using the program discussed above, we find the minimum volume of the MBB Beam and the
individual components of the solution look as follows:

These pictures show that what we find here is in accordance with what one
typically sees in other publications on the topic @cite Bendse2004.
Maybe more interestingly, the
result looks like a truss bridge (except that we apply the load at the top of
the trusses, rather than the bottom as in real truss bridges, akin to a "deck
truss" bridge), suggesting that the designs that have been used in bridge-building
for centuries are indeed based on ideas we can now show to be optimal
in some sense.
<h4>Possibilities for extensions</h4>

The results shown above took around 75 iterations to find, which is quite
concerning given the expense in solving the large linear systems in each
iteration. Looking at the evolution, it does look as though the convergence has
moments of happening quickly and moments of happening slowly. We believe this to
be due to both a lack of precision on when and how to decrease the boundary
values, as well as our choice of merit function being sub-optimal. In the future,
a LOQO barrier update replacing the monotone reduction, as well as a Markov
Filter in place of a merit function will decrease the number of necessary
iterations significantly.

The barrier decrease is most sensitive in the middle of the convergence, which
is problematic, as it seems like we need it to decrease quickly, then slowly,
then quickly again.

Secondly, the linear solver used here is just the sparse direct solver based on
the SparseDirectUMFPACK class. This works reasonably well on small problems,
but the formulation of the optimization problem detailed above has quite a large
number of variables and so the linear problem is not only large but also has a
lot of nonzero entries in many rows, even on meshes that overall are still
relatively coarse. As a consequence, the solver time dominates the
computations, and more sophisticated approaches at solving the linear system
are necessary.
