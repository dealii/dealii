  // @sect3{Evaluation of the solution}

  // As for the program itself, we first define classes that evaluate the
  // solutions of a Laplace equation. In fact, they can evaluate every kind of
  // solution, as long as it is described by a <code>DoFHandler</code> object,
  // and a solution vector. We define them here first, even before the classes
  // that actually generate the solution to be evaluated, since we need to
  // declare an abstract base class that the solver classes can refer to.
  //
  // From an abstract point of view, we declare a pure base class that
  // provides an evaluation operator() which will do the evaluation of the
  // solution (whatever derived classes might consider an
  // <code>evaluation</code>). Since this is the only real function of this
  // base class (except for some bookkeeping machinery), one usually terms
  // such a class that only has an <code>operator()</code> a
  // <code>functor</code> in C++ terminology, since it is used just like a
  // function object.
  //
  // Objects of this functor type will then later be passed to the solver
  // object, which applies it to the solution just computed. The evaluation
  // objects may then extract any quantity they like from the solution. The
  // advantage of putting these evaluation functions into a separate hierarchy
  // of classes is that by design they cannot use the internals of the solver
  // object and are therefore independent of changes to the way the solver
  // works. Furthermore, it is trivial to write another evaluation class
  // without modifying the solver class, which speeds up programming (not
  // being able to use internals of another class also means that you do not
  // have to worry about them -- programming evaluators is usually a rather
  // quickly done task), as well as compilation (if solver and evaluation
  // classes are put into different files: the solver only needs to see the
  // declaration of the abstract base class, and therefore does not need to be
  // recompiled upon addition of a new evaluation class, or modification of an
  // old one).  On a related note, you can reuse the evaluation classes for
  // other projects, solving different equations.
  //
  // In order to improve separation of code into different modules, we put the
  // evaluation classes into a namespace of their own. This makes it easier to
  // actually solve different equations in the same program, by assembling it
  // from existing building blocks. The reason for this is that classes for
  // similar purposes tend to have the same name, although they were developed
  // in different contexts. In order to be able to use them together in one
  // program, it is necessary that they are placed in different
  // namespaces. This we do here:
  namespace Evaluation
  {
    // Now for the abstract base class of evaluation classes: its main purpose
    // is to declare a pure virtual function <code>operator()</code> taking a
    // <code>DoFHandler</code> object, and the solution vector. In order to be
    // able to use pointers to this base class only, it also has to declare a
    // virtual destructor, which however does nothing. Besides this, it only
    // provides for a little bit of bookkeeping: since we usually want to
    // evaluate solutions on subsequent refinement levels, we store the number
    // of the present refinement cycle, and provide a function to change this
    // number.

    // the introduction, we'd like to extract a point value from the solution,

    // point is given to this class through the constructor, as well as a
    // table object into which it will put its findings.
    //
    // Finding out the value of a finite element field at an arbitrary point
    // is rather difficult, if we cannot rely on knowing the actual finite
    // element used, since then we cannot, for example, interpolate between
    // nodes. For simplicity, we therefore assume here that the point at which
    // we want to evaluate the field is actually a node. If, in the process of
    // evaluating the solution, we find that we did not encounter this point
    // upon looping over all vertices, we then have to throw an exception in
    // order to signal to the calling functions that something has gone wrong,
    // rather than silently ignore this error.
    //
    // In the step-9 example program, we have already seen how such an
    // exception class can be declared, using the <code>DeclExceptionN</code>
    // macros. We use this mechanism here again.
    //
    // From this, the actual declaration of this class should be evident. Note

    // implicit destructor is generated from the compiler, and it is virtual
    // just as the one of the base class.

      // used here in that it simply aborts the program, rather than throwing
      // an exception, and that it did so only in debug mode. It was the right
      // macro to use to check about the size of vectors passed as arguments
      // to functions, and the like.
      //
      // However, here the situation is different: whether we find the
      // evaluation point or not may change from refinement to refinement (for
      // example, if the four cells around point are coarsened away, then the
      // point may vanish after refinement and coarsening). This is something
      // that cannot be predicted from a few number of runs of the program in
      // debug mode, but should be checked always, also in production
      // runs. Thus the use of the <code>AssertThrow</code> macro here.

      // Now, if we are sure that we have found the evaluation point, we can
      // add the results into the table of results:
      results_table.add_value("DoFs", dof_handler.n_dofs());
      results_table.add_value("u(x_0)", point_value);

    // @sect4{Generating output}

    // A different, maybe slightly odd kind of <code>evaluation</code> of a
    // solution is to output it to a file in a graphical format. Since in the
    // evaluation functions we are given a <code>DoFHandler</code> object and
    // the solution vector, we have all we need to do this, so we can do it in
    // an evaluation class. The reason for actually doing so instead of
    // putting it into the class that computed the solution is that this way
    // we have more flexibility: if we choose to only output certain aspects
    // of it, or not output it at all. In any case, we do not need to modify
    // the solver class, we just have to modify one of the modules out of
    // which we build this program. This form of encapsulation, as above,
    // helps us to keep each part of the program rather simple as the
    // interfaces are kept simple, and no access to hidden data is possible.
    //
    // Since this class which generates the output is derived from the common
    // <code>EvaluationBase</code> base class, its main interface is the
    // <code>operator()</code> function. Furthermore, it has a constructor
    // taking a string that will be used as the base part of the file name to
    // which output will be sent (we will augment it by a number indicating
    // the number of the refinement cycle -- the base class has this
    // information at hand --, and a suffix), and the constructor also takes a
    // value that indicates which format is requested, i.e. for which graphics
    // program we shall generate output (from this we will then also generate
    // the suffix of the filename to which we write).
    //
    // Regarding the output format, the DataOutBase namespace
    // provides an enumeration field
    // DataOutBase::OutputFormat which lists names for all supported output
    // formats. At the time of writing of this program, the supported graphics
    // formats are represented by the enum values <code>ucd</code>,
    // <code>gnuplot</code>, <code>povray</code>, <code>eps</code>,
    // <code>gmv</code>, <code>tecplot</code>, <code>tecplot_binary</code>,
    // <code>dx</code>, <code>vtk</code>, etc, but this list will certainly
    // grow over time. Now, within various functions of that base class, you
    // can use values of this type to get information about these graphics
    // formats (for example the default suffix used for files of each format),
    // and you can call a generic <code>write</code> function, which then
    // branches to the <code>write_gnuplot</code>, <code>write_ucd</code>, etc
    // functions which we have used in previous examples already, based on the
    // value of a second argument given to it denoting the required output
    // format. This mechanism makes it simple to write an extensible program
    // that can decide which output format to use at runtime, and it also
    // makes it rather simple to write the program in a way such that it takes
    // advantage of newly implemented output formats, without the need to
    // change the application program.

    // the constructor takes values and stores them for later use by the
    // actual evaluation function.

    // @sect4{An abstract base class}

    // In defining a Laplace solver, we start out by declaring an abstract
    // base class, that has no functionality itself except for taking and
    // storing a pointer to the triangulation to be used later.
    //
    // This base class is very general, and could as well be used for any
    // other stationary problem. It provides declarations of functions that
    // shall, in derived classes, solve a problem, postprocess the solution
    // with a list of evaluation objects, and refine the grid,
    // respectively. None of these functions actually does something itself in
    // the base class.
    //
    // Due to the lack of actual functionality, the programming style of
    // declaring very abstract base classes is similar to the style used in
    // Smalltalk or Java programs, where all classes are derived from entirely
    // abstract classes <code>Object</code>, even number representations. The
    // author admits that he does not particularly like the use of such a
    // style in C++, as it puts style over reason. Furthermore, it promotes
    // the use of virtual functions for everything (for example, in Java, all
    // functions are virtual per se), which, however, has proven to be rather
    // inefficient in many applications where functions are often only
    // accessing data, not doing computations, and therefore quickly return;
    // the overhead of virtual functions can then be significant. The opinion
    // of the author is to have abstract base classes wherever at least some
    // part of the code of actual implementations can be shared and thus
    // separated into the base class.
    //
    // Besides all these theoretical questions, we here have a good reason,
    // which will become clearer to the reader below. Basically, we want to be
    // able to have a family of different Laplace solvers that differ so much
    // that no larger common subset of functionality could be found. We
    // therefore just declare such an abstract base class, taking a pointer to
    // a triangulation in the constructor and storing it henceforth. Since
    // this triangulation will be used throughout all computations, we have to
    // make sure that the triangulation is valid until it is last used. We
    // do this by keeping a <code>SmartPointer</code> to this triangulation,
    // as explained in step-7.
    //
    // Note that while the pointer itself is declared constant
    // (i.e. throughout the lifetime of this object, the pointer points to the
    // same object), it is not declared as a pointer to a constant
    // triangulation. In fact, by this we allow that derived classes refine or
    // coarsen the triangulation within the <code>refine_grid</code> function.
    //
    // Finally, we have a function <code>n_dofs</code> is only a tool for the
    // driver functions to decide whether we want to go on with mesh
    // refinement or not. It returns the number of degrees of freedom the
    // present simulation has.

    // the linear system, solving it, and calling the postprocessor objects on
    // the solution. It implements the <code>solve_problem</code> and
    // <code>postprocess</code> functions declared in the base class. It does
    // not, however, implement the <code>refine_grid</code> method, as mesh
    // refinement will be implemented in a number of derived classes.
    //
    // It also declares a new abstract virtual function,
    // <code>assemble_rhs</code>, that needs to be overloaded in
    // subclasses. The reason is that we will implement two different classes
    // that will implement different methods to assemble the right hand side
    // vector. This function might also be interesting in cases where the
    // right hand side depends not simply on a continuous function, but on
    // something else as well, for example the solution of another discretized
    // problem, etc. The latter happens frequently in non-linear problems.
    //
    // As we mentioned previously, the actual content of this class is not

    // representing the boundary values. These are either passed down to the
    // base class's constructor, or are stored and used to generate a
    // <code>DoFHandler</code> object later. Since finite elements and
    // quadrature formula should match, it is also passed a quadrature object.
    //
    // The <code>solve_problem</code> sets up the data structures for the
    // actual solution, calls the functions to assemble the linear system, and
    // solves it.
    //
    // The <code>postprocess</code> function finally takes an evaluation
    // object and applies it to the computed solution.
    //
    // The <code>n_dofs</code> function finally implements the pure virtual
    // function of the base class.

      // The syntax above requires
      // some explanation. There are multiple version of
      // WorkStream::run that expect different arguments. In step-9,
      // we used one version that took a pair of iterators, a pair of
      // pointers to member functions with very specific argument
      // lists, a pointer or reference to the object on which these
      // member functions have to work, and a scratch and copy data
      // object. This is a bit restrictive since the member functions
      // called this way have to have an argument list that exactly
      // matches what WorkStream::run expects: the local assembly
      // function needs to take an iterator, a scratch object and a
      // copy object; and the copy-local-to-global function needs to
      // take exactly a copy object. But, what if we want something
      // that's slightly more general? For example, in the current
      // program, the copy-local-to-global function needs to know
      // which linear system object to write the local contributions
      // into, i.e., it also has to take a <code>LinearSystem</code>
      // argument. That won't work with the approach using member
      // function pointers.
      //
      // Fortunately, C++ offers a way out. These are called function
      // objects. In essence, what WorkStream::run wants to do is not
      // call a member function. It wants to call some function that
      // takes an iterator, a scratch object and a copy object in the
      // first case, and a copy object in the second case. Whether
      // these are member functions, global functions, or something
      // else, is really not of much concern to
      // WorkStream. Consequently, there is a second version of the
      // function that just takes function objects -- objects that
      // have an <code>operator()</code> and that consequently can be
      // called like functions, whatever they really represent. The
      // typical way to generate such function objects is using a
      // <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">lambda
      // function</a> that wraps the function call including the individual
      // arguments with fixed values. All the arguments that are part of the
      // outer function signature are specified as regular function arguments in
      // the lambda function. The fixed values are passed into the lambda
      // function using the capture list (`[...]`). It is possible to use a
      // capture default or to list all the variables that are to be bound to
      // the lambda explicitly. For the sake of clarity we decided to omit
      // the capture default here, but that capture list could equally well be
      // `[&]`, meaning that all used variables are copied into the lambda by
      // reference.
      //
      // At this point, we have assembled the matrix and condensed
      // it. The right hand side may or may not have been completely
      // assembled, but we would like to condense the right hand side
      // vector next. We can only do this if the assembly of this
      // vector has finished, so we have to wait for the task to
      // finish; in computer science, waiting for a task is typically
      // called "joining" the task, explaining the name of the
      // function we call below.
      //
      // Since that task may or may not have finished, and since we
      // may have to wait for it to finish, we may as well try to pack
      // other things that need to be done anyway into this
      // gap. Consequently, we first interpolate boundary values
      // before we wait for the right hand side. Of course, another
      // possibility would have been to also interpolate the boundary
      // values on a separate task since doing so is independent of
      // the other things we have done in this function so far. Feel
      // free to find the correct syntax to also create a task for
      // this interpolation and start it at the top of this function,
      // along with the assembly of the right hand side. (You will
      // find that this is slightly more complicated since there are
      // multiple versions of
      // VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values(), and so simply
      // taking the address
      // <code>&VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values</code>
      // produces a set of overloaded functions that can't be passed
      // to Threads::new_task() right away -- you have to select which
      // element of this overload set you want by casting the address
      // expression to a function pointer type that is specific to the
      // version of the function that you want to call on the task.)
