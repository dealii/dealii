<h3> GMRES Iteration Numbers </h3>

The major advantage for GMG is that it is an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ method,
that is, the complexity of the problem increases linearly with the
problem size. To show then that the linear solver presented in this
tutorial is in fact $\mathcal{O}(n)$, all one needs to do is show that
the iteration counts for the GMRES solve stay roughly constant as we
refine the mesh.

Each of the following tables gives the GMRES iteration counts to reduce the
initial residual by a factor of $10^8$. We selected a sufficient number of smoothing steps
(based on the method) to get iteration numbers independent of mesh size. As
can be seen from the tables below, the method is indeed $\mathcal{O}(n)$.

<h4> DoF/Cell Renumbering </h4>

The point-wise smoothers ("Jacobi" and "SOR") get applied in the order the
DoFs are numbered on each level. We can influence this using the
DoFRenumbering namespace. The block smoothers are applied based on the
ordering we set in `setup_smoother()`. We can visualize this numbering. The
following pictures show the cell numbering of the active cells in downstream,
random, and upstream numbering (left to right):

Let us start with the additive smoothers. The following table shows
the number of iterations necessary to obtain convergence from GMRES:

We see that renumbering the
DoFs/cells has no effect on convergence speed. This is because these
smoothers compute operations on each DoF (point-smoother) or cell
(block-smoother) independently and add up the results. Since we can
define these smoothers as an application of a sum of matrices, and
matrix addition is commutative, the order at which we sum the
different components will not affect the end result.

On the other hand, the situation is different for multiplicative smoothers:

Here, we can speed up
convergence by renumbering the DoFs/cells in the advection direction,
and similarly, we can slow down convergence if we do the renumbering
in the opposite direction. This is because advection-dominated
problems have a directional flow of information (in the advection
direction) which, given the right renumbering of DoFs/cells,
multiplicative methods are able to capture.

This feature of multiplicative methods is, however, dependent on the
value of $\varepsilon$. As we increase $\varepsilon$ and the problem
becomes more diffusion-dominated, we have a more uniform propagation
of information over the mesh and there is a diminished advantage for
renumbering in the advection direction. On the opposite end, in the
extreme case of $\varepsilon=0$ (advection-only), we have a 1st-order
PDE and multiplicative methods with the right renumbering become
effective solvers: A correct downstream numbering may lead to methods
that require only a single iteration because information can be
propagated from the inflow boundary downstream, with no information
transport in the opposite direction. (Note, however, that in the case
of $\varepsilon=0$, special care must be taken for the boundary
conditions in this case).


<h4> %Point vs. block smoothers </h4>

We will limit the results to runs using the downstream
renumbering. Here is a cross comparison of all four smoothers for both

We see that for $Q_1$, both multiplicative smoothers require a smaller
combination of smoothing steps and iteration counts than either
additive smoother. However, when we increase the degree to a $Q_3$
element, there is a clear advantage for the block smoothers in terms
of the number of smoothing steps and iterations required to
solve. Specifically, the block SOR smoother gives constant iteration
counts over the degree, and the block Jacobi smoother only sees about
a 38% increase in iterations compared to 75% and 183% for Jacobi and
SOR respectively.

<h3> Cost </h3>

Iteration counts do not tell the full story in the optimality of a one
smoother over another. Obviously we must examine the cost of an
iteration. Block smoothers here are at a disadvantage as they are
having to construct and invert a cell matrix for each cell. Here is a
comparison of solve times for a $Q_3$ element with 74,496 DoFs:

The smoother that requires the most iterations (Jacobi) actually takes
the shortest time (roughly 2/3 the time of the next fastest
method). This is because all that is required to apply a Jacobi
smoothing step is multiplication by a diagonal matrix which is very
cheap. On the other hand, while SOR requires over 3x more iterations
(each with 3x more smoothing steps) than block SOR, the times are
roughly equivalent, implying that a smoothing step of block SOR is
roughly 9x slower than a smoothing step of SOR. Lastly, block Jacobi
is almost 6x more expensive than block SOR, which intuitively makes
sense from the fact that 1 step of each method has the same cost
(inverting the cell matrices and either adding or multiply them
together), and block Jacobi has 3 times the number of smoothing steps per
iteration with 2 times the iterations.


<h3> Additional points </h3>

There are a few more important points to mention:

<ol>
<li> For a mesh distributed in parallel, multiplicative methods cannot
be executed over the entire domain. This is because they operate one
cell at a time, and downstream cells can only be handled once upstream
cells have already been done. This is fine on a single processor: The
processor just goes through the list of cells one after the
other. However, in parallel, it would imply that some processors are
idle because upstream processors have not finished doing the work on
cells upstream from the ones owned by the current processor. Once the
upstream processors are done, the downstream ones can start, but by
that time the upstream processors have no work left. In other words,
most of the time during these smoother steps, most processors are in
fact idle. This is not how one obtains good parallel scalability!

One can use a hybrid method where
a multiplicative smoother is applied on each subdomain, but as you
increase the number of subdomains, the method approaches the behavior
of an additive method. This is a major disadvantage to these methods.
</li>

<li> Current research into block smoothers suggest that soon we will be
able to compute the inverse of the cell matrices much cheaper than
what is currently being done inside deal.II. This research is based on
the fast diagonalization method (dating back to the 1960s) and has
been used in the spectral community for around 20 years (see, e.g., <a
href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-004-4787-3"> Hybrid
Multigrid/Schwarz Algorithms for the Spectral Element Method by Lottes
and Fischer</a>). There are currently efforts to generalize these
methods to DG and make them more robust. Also, it seems that one
should be able to take advantage of matrix-free implementations and
the fact that, in the interior of the domain, cell matrices tend to
look very similar, allowing fewer matrix inverse computations.
</li>
</ol>

Combining 1. and 2. gives a good reason for expecting that a method
like block Jacobi could become very powerful in the future, even
though currently for these examples it is quite slow.


<h3> Possibilities for extensions </h3>

<h4> Constant iterations for Q<sub>5</sub> </h4>

Change the number of smoothing steps and the smoother relaxation
parameter (set in <code>Smoother::AdditionalData()</code> inside
<code>create_smoother()</code>, only necessary for point smoothers) so
that we maintain a constant number of iterations for a $Q_5$ element.

<h4> Effectiveness of renumbering for changing epsilon </h4>

Increase/decrease the parameter "Epsilon" in the `.prm` files of the
multiplicative methods and observe for which values renumbering no
longer influences convergence speed.

<h4> Mesh adaptivity </h4>

The code is set up to work correctly with an adaptively refined mesh (the
interface matrices are created and set). Devise a suitable refinement
criterium or try the KellyErrorEstimator class.
