# Listing of Parameters
# ---------------------
# The end time of the simulation in years.
set End time                            = 1e8

# Whether graphical output is to be generated or not. You may not want to get
# graphical output if the number of processors is large.
set Generate graphical output           = true

# The number of adaptive refinement steps performed after initial global
# refinement.
set Initial adaptive refinement         = 2

# The number of global refinement steps performed on the initial coarse mesh,
# before the problem is first solved there.
set Initial global refinement           = 5

# The number of time steps between each generation of graphical output files.
set Time steps between graphical output = 50

# The number of time steps after which the mesh is to be adapted based on
# computed error indicators.
set Time steps between mesh refinement  = 10


subsection Discretization
  # The polynomial degree to use for the velocity variables in the Stokes
  # system.
  set Stokes velocity polynomial degree       = 2

  # The polynomial degree to use for the temperature variable.
  set Temperature polynomial degree           = 2

  # Whether to use a Stokes discretization that is locally conservative at the
  # expense of a larger number of degrees of freedom, or to go with a cheaper
  # discretization that does not locally conserve mass (although it is
  # globally conservative.
  set Use locally conservative discretization = true
end


subsection Stabilization parameters
  # The exponent in the entropy viscosity stabilization.
  set alpha = 2

  # The beta factor in the artificial viscosity stabilization. An appropriate
  # value for 2d is 0.052 and 0.078 for 3d.
  set beta  = 0.078

  # The c_R factor in the entropy viscosity stabilization.
  set c_R   = 0.5
