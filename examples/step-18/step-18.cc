// The last step is as in all previous programs:

  // @sect3{The <code>PointHistory</code> class}

  // As was mentioned in the introduction, we have to store the old stress in
  // quadrature point so that we can compute the residual forces at this point
  // during the next time step. This alone would not warrant a structure with
  // only one member, but in more complicated applications, we would have to
  // store more information in quadrature points as well, such as the history
  // variables of plasticity, etc. In essence, we have to store everything
  // that affects the present state of the material here, which in plasticity
  // is determined by the deformation history variables.
  //
  // We will not give this class any meaningful functionality beyond being
  // able to store data, i.e. there are no constructors, destructors, or other
  // member functions. In such cases of `dumb' classes, we usually opt to
  // declare them as <code>struct</code> rather than <code>class</code>, to
  // indicate that they are closer to C-style structures than C++-style
  // classes.
  template <int dim>
  struct PointHistory
  {
    SymmetricTensor<2,dim> old_stress;
  };


  // @sect3{The stress-strain tensor}

  // Next, we define the linear relationship between the stress and the strain
  // in elasticity. It is given by a tensor of rank 4 that is usually written
  // in the form $C_{ijkl} = \mu (\delta_{ik} \delta_{jl} + \delta_{il}
  // \delta_{jk}) + \lambda \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl}$. This tensor maps
  // symmetric tensor of rank 2 to symmetric tensors of rank 2. A function
  // implementing its creation for given values of the Lame constants $\lambda$
  // and $\mu$ is straightforward:
  template <int dim>
  SymmetricTensor<4,dim>
  get_stress_strain_tensor (const double lambda, const double mu)
  {
    SymmetricTensor<4,dim> tmp;
    for (unsigned int i=0; i<dim; ++i)
      for (unsigned int j=0; j<dim; ++j)

                               ((i==l) && (j==k) ? mu : 0.0) +
                               ((i==j) && (k==l) ? lambda : 0.0));
    return tmp;
  }

  // With this function, we will define a static member variable of the main
  // class below that will be used throughout the program as the stress-strain
  // tensor. Note that in more elaborate programs, this will probably be a
  // member variable of some class instead, or a function that returns the
  // stress-strain relationship depending on other input. For example in
  // damage theory models, the Lame constants are considered a function of the
  // prior stress/strain history of a point. Conversely, in plasticity the
  // form of the stress-strain tensor is modified if the material has reached
  // the yield stress in a certain point, and possibly also depending on its
  // prior history.
  //
  // In the present program, however, we assume that the material is
  // completely elastic and linear, and a constant stress-strain tensor is
  // sufficient for our present purposes.



  // @sect3{Auxiliary functions}

  // Before the rest of the program, here are a few functions that we need as
  // tools. These are small functions that are called in inner loops, so we
  // mark them as <code>inline</code>.
  //
  // The first one computes the symmetric strain tensor for shape function
  // <code>shape_func</code> at quadrature point <code>q_point</code> by
  // forming the symmetric gradient of this shape function. We need that when
  // we want to form the matrix, for example.
  //
  // We should note that in previous examples where we have treated
  // vector-valued problems, we have always asked the finite element object in
  // which of the vector component the shape function is actually non-zero,
  // and thereby avoided to compute any terms that we could prove were zero
  // anyway. For this, we used the <code>fe.system_to_component_index</code>
  // function that returns in which component a shape function was zero, and
  // also that the <code>fe_values.shape_value</code> and
  // <code>fe_values.shape_grad</code> functions only returned the value and
  // gradient of the single non-zero component of a shape function if this is
  // a vector-valued element.
  //
  // This was an optimization, and if it isn't terribly time critical, we can
  // get away with a simpler technique: just ask the <code>fe_values</code>
  // for the value or gradient of a given component of a given shape function
  // at a given quadrature point. This is what the
  // <code>fe_values.shape_grad_component(shape_func,q_point,i)</code> call
  // does: return the full gradient of the <code>i</code>th component of shape
  // function <code>shape_func</code> at quadrature point
  // <code>q_point</code>. If a certain component of a certain shape function
  // is always zero, then this will simply always return zero.
  //
  // As mentioned, using <code>fe_values.shape_grad_component</code> instead
  // of the combination of <code>fe.system_to_component_index</code> and
  // <code>fe_values.shape_grad</code> may be less efficient, but its
  // implementation is optimized for such cases and shouldn't be a big
  // slowdown. We demonstrate the technique here since it is so much simpler
  // and straightforward.
  template <int dim>

  SymmetricTensor<2,dim>
  get_strain (const FEValues<dim> &fe_values,

  {
    // Declare a temporary that will hold the return value:
    SymmetricTensor<2,dim> tmp;

    // First, fill diagonal terms which are simply the derivatives in
    // direction <code>i</code> of the <code>i</code> component of the
    // vector-valued shape function:
    for (unsigned int i=0; i<dim; ++i)
      tmp[i][i] = fe_values.shape_grad_component (shape_func,q_point,i)[i];

    // Then fill the rest of the strain tensor. Note that since the tensor is
    // symmetric, we only have to compute one half (here: the upper right
    // corner) of the off-diagonal elements, and the implementation of the
    // <code>SymmetricTensor</code> class makes sure that at least to the
    // outside the symmetric entries are also filled (in practice, the class
    // of course stores only one copy). Here, we have picked the upper right
    // half of the tensor, but the lower left one would have been just as
    // good:
    for (unsigned int i=0; i<dim; ++i)
      for (unsigned int j=i+1; j<dim; ++j)
        tmp[i][j]
          = (fe_values.shape_grad_component (shape_func,q_point,i)[j] +
             fe_values.shape_grad_component (shape_func,q_point,j)[i]) / 2;

    return tmp;
  }


  // The second function does something very similar (and therefore is given
  // the same name): compute the symmetric strain tensor from the gradient of
  // a vector-valued field. If you already have a solution field, the
  // <code>fe_values.get_function_gradients</code> function allows you to extract
  // the gradients of each component of your solution field at a quadrature
  // point. It returns this as a vector of rank-1 tensors: one rank-1 tensor
  // (gradient) per vector component of the solution. From this we have to
  // reconstruct the (symmetric) strain tensor by transforming the data
  // storage format and symmetrization. We do this in the same way as above,
  // i.e. we avoid a few computations by filling first the diagonal and then
  // only one half of the symmetric tensor (the <code>SymmetricTensor</code>
  // class makes sure that it is sufficient to write only one of the two
  // symmetric components).
  //
  // Before we do this, though, we make sure that the input has the kind of
  // structure we expect: that is that there are <code>dim</code> vector
  // components, i.e. one displacement component for each coordinate
  // direction. We test this with the <code>Assert</code> macro that will
  // simply abort our program if the condition is not met.
  template <int dim>

  SymmetricTensor<2,dim>

    return strain;
  }


  // Finally, below we will need a function that computes the rotation matrix
  // induced by a displacement at a given point. In fact, of course, the
  // displacement at a single point only has a direction and a magnitude, it
  // is the change in direction and magnitude that induces rotations. In
  // effect, the rotation matrix can be computed from the gradients of a
  // displacement, or, more specifically, from the curl.
  //
  // The formulas by which the rotation matrices are determined are a little
  // awkward, especially in 3d. For 2d, there is a simpler way, so we
  // implement this function twice, once for 2d and once for 3d, so that we
  // can compile and use the program in both space dimensions if so desired --
  // after all, deal.II is all about dimension independent programming and
  // reuse of algorithm thoroughly tested with cheap computations in 2d, for
  // the more expensive computations in 3d. Here is one case, where we have to
  // implement different algorithms for 2d and 3d, but then can write the rest
  // of the program in a way that is independent of the space dimension.
  //
  // So, without further ado to the 2d implementation:
  Tensor<2,2>
  get_rotation_matrix (const std::vector<Tensor<1,2> > &grad_u)
  {
    // First, compute the curl of the velocity field from the gradients. Note
    // that we are in 2d, so the rotation is a scalar:
    const double curl = (grad_u[1][0] - grad_u[0][1]);

    // From this, compute the angle of rotation:
    const double angle = std::atan (curl);

    // And from this, build the antisymmetric rotation matrix:
    const double t[2][2] = {{ cos(angle), sin(angle) },
      {-sin(angle), cos(angle) }
    };
    return Tensor<2,2>(t);
  }


  // The 3d case is a little more contrived:
  Tensor<2,3>
  get_rotation_matrix (const std::vector<Tensor<1,3> > &grad_u)
  {
    // Again first compute the curl of the velocity field. This time, it is a
    // real vector:
    const Point<3> curl (grad_u[2][1] - grad_u[1][2],
                         grad_u[0][2] - grad_u[2][0],
                         grad_u[1][0] - grad_u[0][1]);

    // From this vector, using its magnitude, compute the tangent of the angle
    // of rotation, and from it the actual angle:
    const double tan_angle = std::sqrt(curl*curl);
    const double angle = std::atan (tan_angle);

    // Now, here's one problem: if the angle of rotation is too small, that
    // means that there is no rotation going on (for example a translational
    // motion). In that case, the rotation matrix is the identity matrix.
    //
    // The reason why we stress that is that in this case we have that
    // <code>tan_angle==0</code>. Further down, we need to divide by that
    // number in the computation of the axis of rotation, and we would get
    // into trouble when dividing doing so. Therefore, let's shortcut this and
    // simply return the identity matrix if the angle of rotation is really
    // small:
    if (angle < 1e-9)
      {
        static const double rotation[3][3]
        = {{ 1, 0, 0}, { 0, 1, 0 }, { 0, 0, 1 } };
        static const Tensor<2,3> rot(rotation);
        return rot;
      }

    // the system, direct what has to be solved in each time step, a function

    // accordingly, and start the same process over again, again with a
    // pristine state. Thus, refining the initial mesh is somewhat simpler

    // is within its own responsibility, the library just allocates some space
    // for these pointers, and application programs can set and read the
    // pointers for each of these objects.


    // Further: we need the objects of linear systems to be solved,
    // i.e. matrix, right hand side vector, and the solution vector. Since we
    // anticipate solving big problems, we use the same types as in step-17,
    // i.e. distributed %parallel matrices and vectors built on top of the
    // PETSc library. Conveniently, they can also be used when running on only
    // a single machine, in which case this machine happens to be the only one
    // in our %parallel universe.
    //
    // However, as a difference to step-17, we do not store the solution
    // vector -- which here is the incremental displacements computed in each
    // time step -- in a distributed fashion. I.e., of course it must be a

    // the network, and is thus slow. In addition, these were repeatedly the
    // same operations, which is certainly undesirable unless the gains of not
    // always having to store the entire vector outweighs it. When writing
    // this program, it turned out that we need a complete copy of the

  // In addition to body forces, movement can be induced by boundary forces
  // and forced boundary displacement. The latter case is equivalent to forces
  // being chosen in such a way that they induce certain displacement.
  //
  // For quasistatic displacement, typical boundary forces would be pressure
  // on a body, or tangential friction against another body. We chose a
  // somewhat simpler case here: we prescribe a certain movement of (parts of)
  // the boundary, or at least of certain components of the displacement
  // vector. We describe this by another vector-valued function that, for a
  // given point on the boundary, returns the prescribed displacement.
  //
  // Since we have a time-dependent problem, the displacement increment of the
  // boundary equals the displacement accumulated during the length of the
  // timestep. The class therefore has to know both the present time and the
  // length of the present time step, and can then approximate the incremental
  // displacement as the present velocity times the present timestep.
  //
  // For the purposes of this program, we choose a simple form of boundary
  // displacement: we displace the top boundary with constant velocity
  // downwards. The rest of the boundary is either going to be fixed (and is
  // then described using an object of type <code>ZeroFunction</code>) or free
  // (Neumann-type, in which case nothing special has to be done).  The

  // should then be obvious using the knowledge we gained through all the

    // or 3 (inner or outer shell) and 0 or 1 (for which no boundary objects
    // have been specified, and for which the library therefore assumes
    // straight lines). Obviously, we want these lines to follow the curved
    // shells, so we have to assign all edges along faces with boundary
    // indicators 2 or 3 these same boundary indicators to make sure they are
    // refined using the appropriate geometry objects. This is easily done:

    // to give an initial upper bound for the number of entries in each row, a
    // task that is traditionally done by
    // <code>DoFHandler::max_couplings_between_dofs()</code>. However, this
    // function suffers from a serious problem: it has to compute an upper
    // bound to the number of nonzero entries in each row, and this is a
    // rather complicated task, in particular in 3d. In effect, while it is
    // quite accurate in 2d, it often comes up with much too large a number in
    // 3d, and in that case the <code>SparsityPattern</code> allocates much
    // too much memory at first, often several 100 MBs. This is later
    // corrected when <code>DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern</code> is called
    // and we realize that we don't need all that much memory, but at time it
    // is already too late: for large problems, the temporary allocation of
    // too much memory can lead to out-of-memory situations.
    //
    // In order to avoid this, we resort to the
    // <code>CompressedSparsityPattern</code> class that is slower but does
    // not require any up-front estimate on the number of nonzero entries per
    // row. It therefore only ever allocates as much memory as it needs at any
    // given time, and we can build it even for large 3d problems.
    //
    // It is also worth noting that the sparsity pattern we construct is
    // global, i.e. comprises all degrees of freedom whether they will be
    // owned by the processor we are on or another one (in case this program
    // is run in %parallel via MPI). This of course is not optimal -- it
    // limits the size of the problems we can solve, since storing the entire
    // sparsity pattern (even if only for a short time) on each processor does
    // not scale well. However, there are several more places in the program
    // in which we do this, for example we always keep the global
    // triangulation and DoF handler objects around, even if we only work on
    // part of them. At present, deal.II does not have the necessary
    // facilities to completely distribute these objects (a task that, indeed,
    // is very hard to achieve with adaptive meshes, since well-balanced
    // subdivisions of a domain tend to become unbalanced as the mesh is
    // adaptively refined).
    //
    // With this data structure, we can then go to the PETSc sparse matrix and
    // tell it to preallocate all the entries we will later want to write to:

    // in this program) in order to preset the entries of the solution vector
    // with the correct boundary values. We provide such a compatible vector
    // in the form of a temporary vector which we then copy into the
    // sequential one.

    // We make up for this complication by showing how boundary values can be
    // used flexibly: following the way we create the triangulation, there are
    // three distinct boundary indicators used to describe the domain,
    // corresponding to the bottom and top faces, as well as the inner/outer
    // surfaces. We would like to impose boundary conditions of the following
    // type: The inner and outer cylinder surfaces are free of external
    // forces, a fact that corresponds to natural (Neumann-type) boundary
    // conditions for which we don't have to do anything. At the bottom, we
    // want no movement at all, corresponding to the cylinder being clamped or
    // cemented in at this part of the boundary. At the top, however, we want
    // a prescribed vertical downward motion compressing the cylinder; in
    // addition, we only want to restrict the vertical movement, but not the
    // horizontal ones -- one can think of this situation as a well-greased
    // plate sitting on top of the cylinder pushing it downwards: the atoms of
    // the cylinder are forced to move downward, but they are free to slide
    // horizontally along the plate.

    // The way to describe this is as follows: for boundary indicator zero
    // (bottom face) we use a dim-dimensional zero function representing no
    // motion in any coordinate direction. For the boundary with indicator 1
    // (top surface), we use the <code>IncrementalBoundaryValues</code> class,
    // but we specify an additional argument to the
    // <code>VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values</code> function denoting
    // which vector components it should apply to; this is a vector of bools
    // for each vector component and because we only want to restrict vertical

  // in the introduction. Each process will only work on the cells it owns,
  // and then write the result into a file of its own. Additionally, processor
  // 0 will write the record files the reference all the .vtu files.
  //
  // The crucial part of this function is to give the <code>DataOut</code>
  // class a way to only work on the cells that the present process owns. This
  // class is already well-equipped for that: it has two virtual functions
  // <code>first_cell</code> and <code>next_cell</code> that return the first
  // cell to be worked on, and given one cell return the next cell to be
  // worked on. By default, these functions return the first active cell
  // (i.e. the first one that has no children) and the next active cell. What
  // we have to do here is derive a class from <code>DataOut</code> that
  // overloads these two functions to only iterate over those cells with the
  // right subdomain indicator.
  //
  // We do this at the beginning of this function. The <code>first_cell</code>
  // function just starts with the first active cell, and then iterates to the
  // next cells while the cell presently under consideration does not yet have
  // the correct subdomain id. The only thing that needs to be taken care of
  // is that we don't try to keep iterating when we have hit the end iterator.
  //
  // The <code>next_cell</code> function could be implemented in a similar
  // way. However, we use this occasion as a pretext to introduce one more
  // thing that the library offers: filtered iterators. These are wrappers for
  // the iterator classes that just skip all cells (or faces, lines, etc) that
  // do not satisfy a certain predicate (a predicate in computer-lingo is a
  // function that when applied to a data element either returns true or
  // false). In the present case, the predicate is that the cell has to have a
  // certain subdomain id, and the library already has this predicate built
  // in. If the cell iterator is not the end iterator, what we then have to do
  // is to initialize such a filtered iterator with the present cell and the
  // predicate, and then increase the iterator exactly once. While the more
  // conventional loop would probably not have been much longer, this is
  // definitely the more elegant way -- and then, these example programs also
  // serve the purpose of introducing what is available in deal.II.

  // @sect4{TopLevel::move_mesh}

  // At the end of each time step, we move the nodes of the mesh according to
  // the incremental displacements computed in this time step. To do this, we
  // keep a vector of flags that indicate for each vertex whether we have
  // already moved it around, and then loop over all cells and move those
  // vertices of the cell that have not been moved yet. It is worth noting
  // that it does not matter from which of the cells adjacent to a vertex we
  // move this vertex: since we compute the displacement using a continuous
  // finite element, the displacement field is continuous as well and we can
  // compute the displacement of a given vertex from each of the adjacent
  // cells. We only have to make sure that we move each node exactly once,
  // which is why we keep the vector of flags.
  //
  // There are two noteworthy things in this function. First, how we get the
  // displacement field at a given vertex using the
  // <code>cell-@>vertex_dof_index(v,d)</code> function that returns the index
  // of the <code>d</code>th degree of freedom at vertex <code>v</code> of the
  // given cell. In the present case, displacement in the k-th coordinate
  // direction corresponds to the k-th component of the finite element. Using a
  // function like this bears a certain risk, because it uses knowledge of the
  // order of elements that we have taken together for this program in the
  // <code>FESystem</code> element. If we decided to add an additional
  // variable, for example a pressure variable for stabilization, and happened
  // to insert it as the first variable of the element, then the computation
  // below will start to produce nonsensical results. In addition, this
  // computation rests on other assumptions: first, that the element we use
  // has, indeed, degrees of freedom that are associated with vertices. This
  // is indeed the case for the present Q1 element, as would be for all Qp
  // elements of polynomial order <code>p</code>. However, it would not hold
  // for discontinuous elements, or elements for mixed formulations. Secondly,
  // it also rests on the assumption that the displacement at a vertex is
  // determined solely by the value of the degree of freedom associated with
  // this vertex; in other words, all shape functions corresponding to other
  // degrees of freedom are zero at this particular vertex. Again, this is the
  // case for the present element, but is not so for all elements that are
  // presently available in deal.II. Despite its risks, we choose to use this
  // way in order to present a way to query individual degrees of freedom
  // associated with vertices.
  //
  // In this context, it is instructive to point out what a more general way
  // would be. For general finite elements, the way to go would be to take a
  // quadrature formula with the quadrature points in the vertices of a
  // cell. The <code>QTrapez</code> formula for the trapezoidal rule does
  // exactly this. With this quadrature formula, we would then initialize an
  // <code>FEValues</code> object in each cell, and use the
  // <code>FEValues::get_function_values</code> function to obtain the values
  // of the solution function in the quadrature points, i.e. the vertices of
  // the cell. These are the only values that we really need, i.e. we are not
  // at all interested in the weights (or the <code>JxW</code> values)
  // associated with this particular quadrature formula, and this can be
  // specified as the last argument in the constructor to
  // <code>FEValues</code>. The only point of minor inconvenience in this
  // scheme is that we have to figure out which quadrature point corresponds
  // to the vertex we consider at present, as they may or may not be ordered
  // in the same order.
  //
  // This inconvenience could be avoided if finite elements have support
  // points on vertices (which the one here has; for the concept of support
  // points, see @ref GlossSupport "support points"). For such a case, one
  // could construct a custom quadrature rule using
  // FiniteElement::get_unit_support_points(). The first
  // <code>GeometryInfo@<dim@>::vertices_per_cell*fe.dofs_per_vertex</code>
  // quadrature points will then correspond to the vertices of the cell and
  // are ordered consistent with <code>cell-@>vertex(i)</code>, taking into
  // account that support points for vector elements will be duplicated
  // <code>fe.dofs_per_vertex</code> times.
  //
  // Another point worth explaining about this short function is the way in
  // which the triangulation class exports information about its vertices:
  // through the <code>Triangulation::n_vertices</code> function, it
  // advertises how many vertices there are in the triangulation. Not all of
  // them are actually in use all the time -- some are left-overs from cells
  // that have been coarsened previously and remain in existence since deal.II
  // never changes the number of a vertex once it has come into existence,
  // even if vertices with lower number go away. Secondly, the location
  // returned by <code>cell-@>vertex(v)</code> is not only a read-only object
  // of type <code>Point@<dim@></code>, but in fact a reference that can be
  // written to. This allows to move around the nodes of a mesh with relative
  // ease, but it is worth pointing out that it is the responsibility of an
  // application program using this feature to make sure that the resulting
  // cells are still useful, i.e. are not distorted so much that the cell is
  // degenerated (indicated, for example, by negative Jacobians). Note that we
  // do not have any provisions in this function to actually ensure this, we
  // just have faith.

  // @sect4{TopLevel::update_quadrature_point_history}

  // At the end of each time step, we should have computed an incremental

  // accommodates for the difference between the external body and boundary
  // forces applied during this time step minus the forces exerted through
  // preexisting internal stresses. In order to have the preexisting
  // stresses available at the next time step, we therefore have to update the
  // preexisting stresses with the stresses due to the incremental
  // displacement computed during the present time step. Ideally, the
  // resulting sum of internal stresses would exactly counter all external
  // forces. Indeed, a simple experiment can make sure that this is so: if we
  // choose boundary conditions and body forces to be time independent, then
  // the forcing terms (the sum of external forces and internal stresses)
  // should be exactly zero. If you make this experiment, you will realize
  // from the output of the norm of the right hand side in each time step that
  // this is almost the case: it is not exactly zero, since in the first time
  // step the incremental displacement and stress updates were computed
  // relative to the undeformed mesh, which was then deformed. In the second
  // time step, we again compute displacement and stress updates, but this
  // time in the deformed mesh -- there, the resulting updates are very small
  // but not quite zero. This can be iterated, and in each such iteration the
  // residual, i.e. the norm of the right hand side vector, is reduced; if one
  // makes this little experiment, one realizes that the norm of this residual
  // decays exponentially with the number of iterations, and after an initial
  // very rapid decline is reduced by roughly a factor of about 3.5 in each
  // iteration (for one testcase I looked at, other testcases, and other
  // numbers of unknowns change the factor, but not the exponential decay).

  // In a sense, this can then be considered as a quasi-timestepping scheme to
  // resolve the nonlinear problem of solving large-deformation elasticity on
  // a mesh that is moved along in a Lagrangian manner.
  //
  // Another complication is that the existing (old) stresses are defined on
  // the old mesh, which we will move around after updating the stresses. If
  // this mesh update involves rotations of the cell, then we need to also
  // rotate the updated stress, since it was computed relative to the
  // coordinate system of the old cell.
  //
  // Thus, what we need is the following: on each cell which the present
