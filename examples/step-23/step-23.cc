// @sect3{Include files}

// We start with the usual assortment of include files that we've seen in so
// many of the previous tests:
#include <deal.II/base/quadrature_lib.h>
#include <deal.II/base/function.h>
#include <deal.II/base/logstream.h>

#include <deal.II/lac/vector.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/full_matrix.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/sparse_matrix.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/solver_cg.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/precondition.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/constraint_matrix.h>

#include <deal.II/grid/tria.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_generator.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/tria_accessor.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/tria_iterator.h>

#include <deal.II/dofs/dof_handler.h>
#include <deal.II/dofs/dof_accessor.h>
#include <deal.II/dofs/dof_tools.h>

#include <deal.II/fe/fe_q.h>
#include <deal.II/fe/fe_values.h>

#include <deal.II/numerics/data_out.h>

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

// Here are the only three include files of some new interest: The first one
// is already used, for example, for the
// VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values and
// MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values functions. However, we here use another
// function in that class, VectorTools::project to compute our initial values
// as the $L^2$ projection of the continuous initial values. Furthermore, we
// use VectorTools::create_right_hand_side to generate the integrals
// $(f^n,\phi^n_i)$. These were previously always generated by hand in
// <code>assemble_system</code> or similar functions in application
// code. However, we're too lazy to do that here, so simply use a library
// function:
#include <deal.II/numerics/vector_tools.h>

// In a very similar vein, we are also too lazy to write the code to assemble
// mass and Laplace matrices, although it would have only taken copying the
// relevant code from any number of previous tutorial programs. Rather, we
// want to focus on the things that are truly new to this program and
// therefore use the MatrixCreator::create_mass_matrix and
// MatrixCreator::create_laplace_matrix functions. They are declared here:
#include <deal.II/numerics/matrix_tools.h>

// Finally, here is an include file that contains all sorts of tool functions
// that one sometimes needs. In particular, we need the
// Utilities::int_to_string class that, given an integer argument, returns a
// string representation of it. It is particularly useful since it allows for
// a second parameter indicating the number of digits to which we want the
// result padded with leading zeros. We will use this to write output files
// that have the form <code>solution-XXX.gnuplot</code> where <code>XXX</code>
// denotes the number of the time step and always consists of three digits
// even if we are still in the single or double digit time steps.
#include <deal.II/base/utilities.h>

// The last step is as in all previous programs:
namespace Step23
{
  using namespace dealii;


  // @sect3{The <code>WaveEquation</code> class}

  // Next comes the declaration of the main class. It's public interface of
  // functions is like in most of the other tutorial programs. Worth
  // mentioning is that we now have to store four matrices instead of one: the
  // mass matrix $M$, the Laplace matrix $A$, the matrix $M+k^2\theta^2A$ used
  // for solving for $U^n$, and a copy of the mass matrix with boundary
  // conditions applied used for solving for $V^n$. Note that it is a bit
  // wasteful to have an additional copy of the mass matrix around. We will
  // discuss strategies for how to avoid this in the section on possible
  // improvements.
  //
  // Likewise, we need solution vectors for $U^n,V^n$ as well as for the
  // corresponding vectors at the previous time step, $U^{n-1},V^{n-1}$. The
  // <code>system_rhs</code> will be used for whatever right hand side vector
  // we have when solving one of the two linear systems in each time
  // step. These will be solved in the two functions <code>solve_u</code> and
  // <code>solve_v</code>.
  //
  // Finally, the variable <code>theta</code> is used to indicate the
  // parameter $\theta$ that is used to define which time stepping scheme to
  // use, as explained in the introduction. The rest is self-explanatory.
