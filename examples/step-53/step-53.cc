// Let us start with the include files we need here. Obviously, we need the
// ones that describe the triangulation (<code>tria.h</code>), and that allow
// us to create and output triangulations (<code>grid_generator.h</code> and
// <code>grid_out.h</code>). Furthermore, we need the header file that
// declares the Manifold and ChartManifold classes that we will need to
// describe the geometry (<code>manifold.h</code>). We will then also need
// the GridTools::transform() function from the last of the following header
// files; the purpose for this function will become discussed at the point
// where we use it.
#include <deal.II/grid/tria.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_generator.h>

#include <deal.II/grid/manifold.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_tools.h>

// The remainder of the include files relate to reading the topography data.
// As explained in the introduction, we will read it from a file and then
// use the Functions::InterpolatedUniformGridData class that is declared in the
// first of the following header files. Because the data is large, the file
// we read from is stored as gzip compressed data and we make use of
// some BOOST-provided functionality to read directly from gzipped data.

  // data file that contains information about a particular area of the
  // world for which we know the extents.

  // proceed to create a $1\times 2\times 1$ rectangular mesh that
  // corresponds to the reference domain
  // $\hat U=[26,35]\times[-10,5]\times[-500000,0]$. We choose
  // this number of subdivisions because it leads to cells that
  // are roughly like cubes instead of stretched in one direction or
  // another.
  //
  // Of course, we are not actually interested in meshing the
  // reference domain. We are interested in meshing the real domain.
  // Consequently, we will use the GridTools::transform() function
  // that simply moves every point of a triangulation according to
  // a given transformation. The transformation function it wants is
  // a function that takes as its single argument a point in the reference
  // domain and returns the corresponding location in the domain that we
  // want to map to. This is, of course, exactly the push forward
  // function of the geometry we use. However,
  // <code>AfricaGeometry::push_forward()</code> requires two arguments:
  // the <code>AfricaGeometry</code> object to work with via its implicit
  // <code>this</code> pointer, and the point. We bind the first of these
  // to the geometry object we have created at the top of the function
  // and leave the second one open, obtaining the desired object to
