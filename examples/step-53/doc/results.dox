Running the program produces a mesh file <code>mesh.vtu</code> that we can
visualize with any of the usual visualization programs that can read the VTU
file format. If one just looks at the mesh itself, it is actually very difficult
to see anything that doesn't just look like a perfectly round piece of a
sphere (though if one modified the program so that it does produce a sphere and
looked at them at the same time, the difference between the overall sphere and
WGS 84 shape is quite apparent). Apparently, Earth is actually quite a flat place.
Of course we already know this from satellite pictures. 
However, we can tease out something more by
coloring cells by their volume. This both produces slight variations in hue
along the top surface and something for the visualization programs to apply
their shading algorithms to (because the top surfaces of the cells are now no
longer just tangential to a sphere but tilted):

Yet, at least as far as visualizations are concerned, this is still not too
impressive. Rather, let us visualize things in a way so that we show the
actual elevation along the top surface. In other words, we want a picture like
this, with an incredible amount of detail:

A zoom-in of this picture shows the vertical displacement quite clearly (here,

These image were produced with three small modifications: 
<ol>
  <li> An additional seventh mesh refinement towards the top surface for the
  first of these two pictures, and a total of nine for the second. In the
  second image, the horizontal mesh size is approximately 1.5km, and just
  under 1km in vertical direction. (The picture was also created using a
  more resolved data set; however, it is too big to distribute as part of
  the tutorial.)
  
  <li> The addition of the following function that, given a point 
  <code>x</code> computes the elevation by converting the point to
  reference WGS 84 coordinates and only keeping the depth variable (the
  function is, consequently, a simplified version of the
  <code>AfricaGeometry::pull_back_wgs84()</code> version:

@code
#include <deal.II/fe/fe_q.h>
#include <deal.II/dofs/dof_handler.h>
#include <deal.II/numerics/data_out.h>
#include <deal.II/numerics/vector_tools.h>


double get_elevation (const Point<3> &x)
  {
    const double R           = 6378137;
    const double ellipticity = 8.1819190842622e-2;

    const double b     = std::sqrt(R * R * (1 - ellipticity * ellipticity));
    const double ep    = std::sqrt((R * R - b * b) / (b * b));
    const double p     = std::sqrt(x(0) * x(0) + x(1) * x(1));
    const double th    = std::atan2(R * x(2), b * p);
    const double theta = std::atan2((x(2) + ep * ep * b * std::sin(th) * std::sin(th) * std::sin(th)),
                                      (p - (ellipticity * ellipticity * R  * (std::cos(th) * std::cos(th) * std::cos(th)))));
    const double R_bar = R / (std::sqrt(1 - ellipticity * ellipticity * std::sin(theta) * std::sin(theta)));
    const double R_plus_d = p / std::cos(theta);

    return R_plus_d - R_bar;
  }

  <li>Adding the following piece to the bottom of the <code>run()</code> function:

@code
      FE_Q<3>       fe(1);
      DoFHandler<3> dof_handler (triangulation);
      dof_handler.distribute_dofs(fe);

      Vector<double> elevation (dof_handler.n_dofs());
      {
        std::map<unsigned int,double> boundary_values;
        VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values(dof_handler,
                                                 5,
                                                 ScalarFunctionFromFunctionObject<3>(get_elevation),
                                                 boundary_values);
        for (std::map<unsigned int,double>::const_iterator p = boundary_values.begin(); 
             p!=boundary_values.end(); ++p)
          elevation[p->first] = p->second;
      }

      DataOut<3>    data_out;
      data_out.attach_dof_handler(dof_handler);
      data_out.add_data_vector (elevation, "elevation");
      data_out.build_patches();

      std::ofstream out ("data.vtu");
      data_out.write_vtu (out);
@endcode
</ol>
This last piece of code first creates a $Q_1$ finite element space on the mesh.
It then (ab)uses VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values() to evaluate the
elevation function for every node at the top boundary (the one with boundary
indicator 5). We here wrap the call to <code>get_elevation()</code> with the
ScalarFunctionFromFunctionObject class to make a regular C++ function look
like an object of a class derived from the Function class that we want
to use in VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values(). Having so gotten a list
of degrees of freedom located at the top boundary and corresponding elevation
values, we just go down this list and set these elevations in the 
<code>elevation</code> vector (leaving all interior degrees of freedom at
their original zero value). This vector is then output using DataOut as
usual and can be visualized as shown above.
