<h3> About the tutorial </h3>

Since this is the first tutorial program, let us comment first on how
this tutorial and the rest of the deal.II documentation is supposed to
work. The documentation for deal.II comes essentially at three
different levels:
- The tutorial: This is a collection of programs that shows how
  deal.II is used in practice. It doesn't typically discuss individual
  functions at the level of individual arguments, but rather wants to
  give the big picture of how things work together. In other words, it
  discusses "concepts": what are the building blocks of deal.II and
  how are they used together in finite element programs.
- The manual: This is the documentation of every single class and
  every single (member) function in deal.II. You get there if, for
  example, you click on the "Main page" or "Classes" tab at the top of
  this page. This is the place where you would look up what the second
  argument of Triangulation::create_triangulation_compatibility means,
  to give just one slightly obscure example. You need this level of
  documentation for when you know what you want to do, but forgot how
  exactly the function was named, what its arguments are, or what it
  returns. Note that you also get into the manual whenever you read
  through the tutorial and click on any of the class or function
  names, i.e. the tutorial contains a great many links into the manual
  for whenever you need a more detailed description of a function or
  class. On the other hand, the manual is not a good place to learn
  deal.II since it gives you a microscopic view of things without
  telling you how a function might fit into the bigger picture.
- Modules: These are groups of classes and functions that work
  together or have related functionality. If you click on the
  "Modules" tab at the top of this page, you end up on a page that
  lists a number of such groups. Each module discusses the underlying
  principles of these classes; for example, the @ref Sparsity module
  talks about all sorts of different issues related to storing
  sparsity patterns of matrices. This is documentation at an
  intermediate level: they give you an overview of what's there in a
  particular area. For example when you wonder what finite element
  classes exist, you would take a look at the @ref fe module. The
  modules are, of course, also cross-linked to the manual (and, at
  times, to the tutorial); if you click on a class name, say on
  Triangulation, would will also at the very top right under the class
  name get a link to the modules this class is a member of if you want
  to learn more about its context.

Let's come back to the tutorial, since you are looking at the first program
(or "step") of it. Each tutorial program is subdivided into the following
sections:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Introduction:</b> This is a discussion of what the program
       does, including the mathematical model, and
       what programming techniques are new compared to previous
       tutorial programs.
  <li> <b>The commented program:</b> An extensively documented listing of the
       source code. Here, we often document individual lines, or
       blocks of code, and discuss what they do, how they do it, and
       why. The comments frequently reference the introduction,
       i.e. you have to understand <i>what</i> the program wants to achieve
       (a goal discussed in the introduction) before you can
       understand <i>how</i> it intends to get there.
  <li> <b>Results:</b> The output of the program, with comments and
       interpretation. This section also frequently has a subsection
       that gives suggestions on how to extend the program in various
       direction; in the earlier programs, this is intended to give
       you directions for little experiments designed to make your
       familiar with deal.II, while in later programs it is more about
       how to use more advanced numerical techniques.
  <li> <b>The plain program:</b> The source code stripped of
       all comments. This is useful if you want to see the "big
       picture" of the code, since the commented version of the
       program has so much text in between that it is often difficult
       to see the entire code of a single function on the screen at
       once.
</ol>

The tutorials are not only meant to be static documentation, but you
should play with them. To this end, go to the
<code>examples/step-1</code> directory (or whatever the number of the
tutorial is that you're interested in) and type
@code
  cmake .
  make
  make run
@endcode
The first command sets up the files that describe which include files this
tutorial program depends on, how to compile it and how to run it. This command
should find the installed deal.II libraries as well that were generated when
you compiled and installed everything as described in the <a
href="http://www.dealii.org/readme.html">deal.II ReadMe file</a>.
If this command should fail to find the deal.II library, then you need to
provide the path to the installation using the command
@code
  cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/installed/deal.II .
@endcode
instead.

The second of the commands above compiles the sources into an executable, while the
last one executes it (strictly speaking, <code>make run</code> will also
compile the code if the executable doesn't exist yet, so you could
have skipped the second command if you wanted). This is all that's
needed to run the code and produce the output that is discussed in the
"Results" section of the tutorial programs. This sequence needs to be repeated
in all of the tutorial directories you want to play with.

When learning the library, you need to play with it and see what
happens. To this end, open the <code>examples/step-1/step-1.cc</code>
source file with your favorite editor and modify it in some way, save it and
run it as above. A few suggestions for possibly modifications are given at the
end of the results section of this program, where we also provide a few links
to other useful pieces of information.


<h3> Video lectures on tutorial programs </h3>

This and several of the other tutorial programs are also discussed and
demonstrated in <a
href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~bangerth/videos.html">Wolfgang
Bangerth's video lectures</a> on deal.II and computational science. In
particular, you can see the steps he executes to run this and other
programs, and you will get a much better idea of the tools that can be
used to work with deal.II. In particular, lectures 2 and 4 give an overview of
deal.II and of the building blocks of any finite element code.


<h3> What this program does </h3>

Let's come back to step-1, the current program.
In this first example, we don't actually do very much, but show two
techniques: what is the syntax to generate triangulation objects, and
some elements of simple loops over all cells. We create two grids, one
which is a regularly refined square (not very exciting, but a common
starting grid for some problems), and one more geometric attempt: a
ring-shaped domain, which is refined towards the inner edge. Through
this, you will get to know three things every finite element program
will have to have somewhere: An object of type Triangulation for the
mesh; a call to the GridGenerator functions to generate a mesh; and
loops over all cells that involve iterators (iterators are a
generalization of pointers and are frequently used in the C++ standard
library; in the context of deal.II, the @ref Iterators module talks
about them).

The program is otherwise small enough that it doesn't need a whole lot
of introduction.

<h3> About scientific computing in general </h3>

If you are reading through this tutorial program, chances are that you are
interested in continuing to use deal.II for your own projects. Thus, you are
about to embark on an exercise in programming using a large-scale scientific
computing library. Unless you are already an experienced user of large-scale
programming methods, this may be new territory for you &mdash; with all the
new rules that go along with it such as the fact that you will have to deal
with code written by others, that you may have to think about documenting your
own code because you may not remember what exactly it is doing a year down the
road (or because others will be using it as well), or coming up with ways to
test that your program is doing the right thing. None of this is something
that we typically train mathematicians, engineers, or scientists in but that
is important when you start writing software of more than a few hundred
lines. Remember: Producing software is not the same as just writing code.

To make your life easier on this journey let us point to three resources that
are worthwhile browsing through before you start any large-scale programming:

- <a href="https://github.com/dealii/dealii/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions">
  The deal.II FAQ</a> has a good number of answers to questions about
  particular aspects of deal.II, but also to more general questions such as "How
  do I debug scientific computing codes?" or "Can I train myself to write code
  that has fewer bugs?".

- The <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry project</a>
  that provides introductions to many topics that are important to dealing
  with software, such as version control, make files, testing, etc. It is
  specifically written for scientists and engineers, not for computer
  scientists, and has a focus on short, practical lessons.

- An article on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530">Best
  Practices for Scientific Computing</a> that gives an introduction to
  many of the ways by which you can make sure you are an efficient
  programmer writing programs that work.

As a general recommendation: If you expect to spend more than a few days
writing software in the future, do yourself the favor of learning tools that
can make your life more productive, in particular debuggers and integrated
development environments. (@dealiiVideoLectureSeeAlso{7,8,8.01,25})
You will find that you will get the time spent
learning these tools back severalfold soon by being more productive!
Several of the video lectures referenced above show how to use tools
such as integrated development environments or debuggers.
