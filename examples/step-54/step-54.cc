// @sect3{Include files}

// We start with including a bunch of files that we will use in the
// various parts of the program. Most of them have been discussed in
// previous tutorials already:
#include <deal.II/grid/tria.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/tria_iterator.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/tria_accessor.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_generator.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_in.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_out.h>
#include <deal.II/numerics/data_out.h>
#include <deal.II/numerics/vector_tools.h>

// These are the headers of the opencascade support classes and
// functions. Notice that these will contain sensible data only if you
// compiled your deal.II library with support for OpenCASCADE, i.e.,
// specifying <code>-DDEAL_II_WITH_OPENCASCADE=ON</code> and
// <code>-DOPENCASCADE_DIR=/path/to/your/opencascade/installation</code>
// when calling <code>cmake</code> during deal.II configuration.
#include <deal.II/opencascade/boundary_lib.h>
#include <deal.II/opencascade/utilities.h>


// Finally, a few C++ standard header files
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

  // and listed in the enumeration type at the top of the class.

  // The member functions of this class are similar to what you can
  // find in most of the other tutorial programs in the setup stage of
  // the grid for the simulations.

  // @sect4{TriangulationOnCAD::read_domain}


  // The following function represents the core of this program.  In
  // this function we import the CAD shape upon which we want to
  // generate and refine our triangulation. We assume that the CAD
  // surface is contained in the @p cad_file_name file (we provide an
  // example IGES file in the input directory called
  // "input/DTMB-5415_bulbous_bow.iges" that represents the bulbous bow of a
  // ship). The presence of several convex and concave high curvature
  // regions makes the geometry we provided a particularly meaningful
  // example.
  //
  // After importing the hull bow surface, we extract some of the
  // curves and surfaces composing it, and use them to generate a set
  // of projectors. Such projectors define the rules the Triangulation
  // has to follow to position each new node during cell refinement.
  //
  // To initialize the Triangulation, as done in previous tutorial
  // programs, we import a pre-existing grid saved in VTK format. We
  // assume here that the user has generated a coarse mesh
  // externally, which matches the IGES geometry. At the moment of
  // writing this tutorial, the
  // deal.II library does not automatically support generation of such
  // meshes, but there are several tools which can provide you with
  // reasonable initial meshes starting from CAD files.
  // In our example, the imported mesh is composed of a single
  // quadrilateral cell whose vertices have been placed on the CAD
  // shape.
  //
  // After importing both the IGES geometry and the initial mesh, we
  // assign the projectors previously discussed to each of the edges
  // and cells which will have to be refined on the CAD surface.
  //
  // In this tutorial, we will test the three different CAD surface
  // projectors described in the introduction, and will analyze the
  // results obtained with each of them.  As mentioned, each of these
  // projection strategies has been implemented in a different class,
  // and objects of these types can be assigned to a triangulation
  // using the Triangulation::set_manifold method.
  //
  // The following function then first imports the given CAD file.
  // The function arguments are a string containing the desired file
  // name, and a scale factor. In this example, the scale factor is
  // set to 1e-3, as the original geometry is written in millimeters
  // (which is the typical unit of measure for most IGES files),
  // while we prefer to work in meters.  The output of the function
  // is an object of OpenCASCADE generic topological shape class,
  // namely a @p TopoDS_Shape.
  void TriangulationOnCAD::read_domain()
  {
    TopoDS_Shape bow_surface = OpenCASCADE::read_IGES(cad_file_name, 1e-3);

    // Each CAD geometrical object is defined along with a tolerance,
    // which indicates possible inaccuracy of its placement. For
    // instance, the tolerance @p tol of a vertex indicates that it can
    // be located in any point contained in a sphere centered in the
    // nominal position and having radius @p tol. While projecting a
    // point onto a surface (which will in turn have its tolerance) we
    // must keep in mind that the precision of the projection will be
    // limited by the tolerance with which the surface is built.

    // The following method extracts the tolerance of the given shape and
    // makes it a bit bigger to stay our of trouble:
    const double tolerance = OpenCASCADE::get_shape_tolerance(bow_surface) * 5;

    // We now want to extract a set of composite sub-shapes from the
    // generic shape. In particular, each face of the CAD file
    // is composed of a trimming curve of type @p TopoDS_Wire, which is
    // the collection of @p TopoDS_Edges that compose the boundary of a
    // surface, and a NURBS description of the surface itself. We will
    // use a line projector to associate the boundary of our
    // Triangulation to the wire delimiting the surface.  To extract
    // all compound sub-shapes, like wires, shells, or solids, we
    // resort to a method of the OpenCASCADE namespace.  The input of
    // OpenCASCADE::extract_compound_shapes is a shape and a set of empty
    // std::vectors of subshapes, which will be filled with all
    // compound shapes found in the given topological shape:
    std::vector<TopoDS_Compound>  compounds;
    std::vector<TopoDS_CompSolid> compsolids;
    std::vector<TopoDS_Solid>     solids;
    std::vector<TopoDS_Shell>     shells;

    // according to the CAD geometry imported above. This this end, we get an
    // iterator to that cell and assign to it the manifold_id 1 (see
    // @ref GlossManifoldIndicator "this glossary entry").
    // We also get an iterator to its four faces, and assign each of them

    // specified.

    // lying between the edge vertices. We first check
    // that the wires vector contains at least one element and then
    // create a Manifold object for it.
