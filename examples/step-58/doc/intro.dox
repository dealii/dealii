<h1>Introduction</h1>

The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Nonlinear
Schr&ouml;dinger Equation (NLSE)</a> for a function $\psi=\psi(\mathbf
x,t)$ and a potential $V=V(\mathbf x)$ is a model often used in
quantum mechanics and nonlinear optics. If one measures in appropriate
quantities (so that $\hbar=1$), then it reads as follows:
@f{align*}{
  - i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
  - \frac 12 \Delta \psi
  + V \psi
  + \kappa |\psi|^2 \psi
  &= 0
  \qquad\qquad
  &
  \text{in}\; \Omega\times (0,T),
  \\
  \psi(\mathbf x,0) &= \psi_0(\mathbf x)
  &
  \text{in}\; \Omega,
  \\
  \psi(\mathbf x,t) &= 0
  &
  \text{on}\; \partial\Omega\times (0,T).
@f}
If there is no potential, i.e. $V(\mathbf x)=0$, then it can be used
to describe the propagation of light in optical fibers. If $V(\mathbf
x)\neq 0$, the equation is also sometimes called the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross%E2%80%93Pitaevskii_equation">Gross-Pitaevskii
equation</a> and can be used to model the time dependent behavior of
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate">Bose-Einstein
condensates</a>.

For this particular tutorial program, the physical interpretation of
the equation is not of much concern to us. Rather, we want to use it
as a model that allows us to explain two aspects:
- It is a <b>complex-valued equation</b> for $\psi \in H^1(\Omega,{\mathbb
  C})$. We have previously seen complex-valued equations in step-29,
  but there have opted to split the equations into real and imaginary
  parts and consequently ended up solving a system of two real-valued
  equations. In contrast, the goal here is to show how to solve
  problems in which we keep everything as complex numbers.
- The equation is a nice model problem to explain how <b>operator
  splitting methods</b> work. This is because it has terms with
  fundamentally different character: on the one hand, $- \frac 12
  \Delta \psi$ is a regular spatial operator in the way we have seen
  many times before; on the other hand, $\kappa |\psi(\mathbf x,t)|^2
  \psi$ has no spatial or temporal derivatives, i.e., it is a purely
  local operator. It turns out that we have efficient methods for each
  of these terms (in particular, we have analytic solutions for the
  latter), and that we may be better off treating these terms
  differently and separately. We will explain this in more detail
  below.



<h3>A note about the character of the equations</h3>

At first glance, the equations appear to be parabolic and similar to
the heat equation (see step-26) as there is only a single time
derivative and two spatial derivatives. But this is misleading.
Indeed, that this is not the correct interpretation is
more easily seen if we assume for a moment that the potential $V=0$
and $\kappa=0$. Then we have the equation
@f{align*}{
  - i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
  - \frac 12 \Delta \psi
  &= 0.
@f}
If we separate the solution into real and imaginary parts, $\psi=v+iw$,
with $v=\textrm{Re}\;\psi,\; w=\textrm{Im}\;\psi$,
then we can split the one equation into its real and imaginary parts
in the same way as we did in step-29:
@f{align*}{
  \frac{\partial w}{\partial t}
  - \frac 12 \Delta v
  &= 0,
  \\
  -\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}
  - \frac 12 \Delta w
  &= 0.
@f}
Not surprisingly, the factor $i$ in front of the time derivative
couples the real and imaginary parts of the equation. If we want to
understand this equation further, take the time derivative of one of
the equations, say
@f{align*}{
  \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2}
  - \frac 12 \Delta \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}
  &= 0,
@f}
(where we have assumed that, at least in some formal sense, we can
commute the spatial and temporal derivatives), and then insert the
other equation into it:
@f{align*}{
  \frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial t^2}
  + \frac 14 \Delta^2 w
  &= 0.
@f}
This equation is hyperbolic and similar in character to the wave
equation. (This will also be obvious if you look at the video
in the "Results" section of this program.) Furthermore, we could
have arrived at the same equation for $v$ as well.
Consequently, a better assumption for the NLSE is to think of
it as a hyperbolic, wave-propagation equation than as a diffusion
equation such as the heat equation. (You may wonder whether it is
correct that the operator $\Delta^2$ appears with a positive sign
whereas in the wave equation, $\Delta$ has a negative sign. This is
indeed correct: After multiplying by a test function and integrating
by parts, we want to come out with a positive (semi-)definite
form. So, from $-\Delta u$ we obtain $+(\nabla v,\nabla u)$. Likewise,
after integrating by parts twice, we obtain from $+\Delta^2 u$ the
form $+(\Delta v,\Delta u)$. In both cases do we get the desired positive
sign.)

The real NLSE, of course, also has the terms $V\psi$ and
$\kappa|\psi|^2\psi$. However, these are of lower order in the spatial
derivatives, and while they are obviously important, they do not
change the character of the equation.

In any case, the purpose of this discussion is to figure out
what time stepping scheme might be appropriate for the equation. The
conclusions is that, as a hyperbolic-kind of equation, we need to
choose a time step that satisfies a CFL-type condition. If we were to
use an explicit method (which we will not), we would have to investigate
the eigenvalues of the matrix that corresponds to the spatial
operator. If you followed the discussions of the video lectures
(@dealiiVideoLectureSeeAlso{26,27,28})
then you will remember that the pattern is that one needs to make sure
that $k^s \propto h^t$ where $k$ is the time step, $h$ the mesh width,
and $s,t$ are the orders of temporal and spatial derivatives.
Whether you take the original equation ($s=1,t=2$) or the reformulation
for only the real or imaginary part, the outcome is that we would need to
choose $k \propto h^2$ if we were to use an explicit time stepping
method. This is not feasible for the same reasons as in step-26 for
the heat equation: It would yield impractically small time steps
for even only modestly refined meshes. Rather, we have to use an
implicit time stepping method and can then choose a more balanced
$k \propto h$. Indeed, we will use the implicit Crank-Nicolson
method as we have already done in step-23 before for the regular
wave equation.


<h3>The general idea of operator splitting</h3>

@dealiiVideoLecture{30.25}

If one thought of the NLSE as an ordinary differential equation in
which the right hand side happens to have spatial derivatives, i.e.,
write it as
@f{align*}{
  \frac{d\psi}{dt}
  &=
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi
  -i V \psi
  -i\kappa |\psi|^2 \psi,
  \qquad\qquad
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (0,T),
  \\
  \psi(0) &= \psi_0,
@f}
one may be tempted to "formally solve" it by integrating both sides
over a time interval $[t_{n},t_{n+1}]$ and obtain
@f{align*}{
  \psi(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi(t_n)
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi(t)
  -i V \psi(t)
  -i\kappa |\psi(t)|^2 \psi(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt.
@f}
Of course, it's not that simple: the $\psi(t)$ in the integrand is
still changing over time in accordance with the differential equation,
so we cannot just evaluate the integral (or approximate it easily via
quadrature) because we don't know $\psi(t)$.
But we can write this with separate contributions as
follows, and this will allow us to deal with different terms separately:
@f{align*}{
  \psi(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi(t_n)
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i V \psi(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i\kappa |\psi(t)|^2 \,\psi(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt.
@f}
The way this equation can now be read is as follows: For each time interval
$[t_{n},t_{n+1}]$, the change $\psi(t_{n+1})-\psi(t_{n})$ in the
solution consists of three contributions:
- The contribution of the Laplace operator.
- The contribution of the potential $V$.
- The contribution of the "phase" term $-i\kappa |\psi(t)|^2\,\psi(t)$.

<i>Operator splitting</i> is now an approximation technique that
allows us to treat each of these contributions separately. (If we
want: In practice, we will treat the first two together, and the last
one separate. But that is a detail, conceptually we could treat all of
them differently.) To this end, let us introduce three separate "solutions":
@f{align*}{
  \psi^{(1)}(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi(t_n)
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(1)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt,
\\
  \psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi(t_n)
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i V \psi^{(2)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt,
\\
  \psi^{(3)}(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi(t_n)
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(3)}(t)|^2 \,\psi^{(3)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt.
@f}

These three "solutions" can be thought of as satisfying the following
differential equations:
@f{align*}{
  \frac{d\psi^{(1)}}{dt}
  &=
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(1)},
  \qquad
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(1)}(t_n) &= \psi(t_n),
\\
  \frac{d\psi^{(2)}}{dt}
  &=
  -i V \psi^{(2)},
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(2)}(t_n) &= \psi(t_n),
\\
  \frac{d\psi^{(3)}}{dt}
  &=
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(3)}|^2 \,\psi^{(3)},
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(3)}(t_n) &= \psi(t_n).
@f}
In other words, they are all trajectories $\psi^{(k)}$ that start at
$\psi(t_n)$ and integrate up the effects of exactly one of the three
terms. The increments resulting from each of these terms over our time
interval are then $I^{(1)}=\psi^{(1)}(t_{n+1})-\psi(t_n)$,
$I^{(2)}=\psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1})-\psi(t_n)$, and
$I^{(3)}=\psi^{(3)}(t_{n+1})-\psi(t_n)$.

It is now reasonable to assume (this is an approximation!) that the
change due to all three of the effects in question is well approximated
by the sum of the three separate increments:
@f{align*}{
 \psi(t_{n+1})-\psi(t_n)
 \approx
 I^{(1)} + I^{(2)} + I^{(3)}.
@f}
This intuition is indeed correct, though the approximation is not
exact: the difference between the exact left hand side and the term
$I^{(1)}+I^{(2)}+I^{(3)}$ (i.e., the difference between the <i>exact</i> increment
for the exact solution $\psi(t)$ when moving from $t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$,
and the increment composed of the three parts on the right hand side),
is proportional to $\Delta t=t_{n+1}-t_{n}$. In other words, this
approach introduces an error of size ${\cal O}(\Delta t)$. Nothing we
have done so far has discretized anything in time or space, so the
<i>overall</i> error is going to be ${\cal O}(\Delta t)$ plus whatever
error we commit when approximating the integrals (the temporal
discretization error) plus whatever error we commit when approximating
the spatial dependencies of $\psi$ (the spatial error).

Before we continue with discussions about operator splitting, let us
talk about why one would even want to go this way? The answer is
simple: For some of the separate equations for the $\psi^{(k)}$, we
may have ways to solve them more efficiently than if we throw
everything together and try to solve it at once. For example, and
particularly pertinent in the current case: The equation for
$\psi^{(3)}$, i.e.,
@f{align*}{
  \frac{d\psi^{(3)}}{dt}
  &=
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(3)}|^2 \,\psi^{(3)},
  \qquad\qquad
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(3)}(t_n) &= \psi(t_n),
@f}
or equivalently,
@f{align*}{
  \psi^{(3)}(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi(t_n)
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(3)}(t)|^2 \,\psi^{(3)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt,
@f}
can be solved exactly: the equation is solved by
@f{align*}{
  \psi^{(3)}(t) = e^{-i\kappa|\psi(t_n)|^2 (t-t_{n})} \psi(t_n).
@f}
This is easy to see if (i) you plug this solution into the
differential equation, and (ii) realize that the magnitude
$|\psi^{(3)}|$ is constant, i.e., the term $|\psi(t_n)|^2$ in the
exponent is in fact equal to $|\psi^{(3)}(t)|^2$. In other words, the
solution of the ODE for $\psi^{(3)}(t)$ only changes its <i>phase</i>,
but the <i>magnitude</i> of the complex-valued function $\psi^{(3)}(t)$
remains constant. This makes computing $I^{(3)}$ particularly convenient:
we don't actually need to solve any ODE, we can write the solution
down by hand. Using the operator splitting approach, none of the
methods to compute $I^{(1)},I^{(2)}$ therefore have to deal with the nonlinear
term and all of the associated unpleasantries: we can get away with
solving only <i>linear</i> problems, as long as we allow ourselves the
luxury of using an operator splitting approach.

Secondly, one often uses operator splitting if the different physical
effects described by the different terms have different time
scales. Imagine, for example, a case where we really did have some
sort of diffusion equation. Diffusion acts slowly, but if $\kappa$ is
large, then the "phase rotation" by the term $-i\kappa
|\psi^{(3)}(t)|^2 \,\psi^{(3)}(t)$ acts quickly. If we treated
everything together, this would imply having to take rather small time
steps. But with operator splitting, we can take large time steps
$\Delta t=t_{n+1}-t_{n}$ for the diffusion, and (assuming we didn't
have an analytic solution) use an ODE solver with many small time
steps to integrate the "phase rotation" equation for $\psi^{(3)}$ from
$t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$. In other words, operator splitting allows us to
decouple slow and fast time scales and treat them differently, with
methods adjusted to each case.


<h3>Operator splitting: the "Lie splitting" approach</h3>

While the method above allows to compute the three contributions
$I^{(k)}$ in parallel, if we want, the method can be made slightly
more accurate and easy to implement if we don't let the trajectories
for the $\psi^{(k)}$ start all at $\psi(t_n)$, but instead let the
trajectory for $\psi^{(2)}$ start at the <i>end point</i> of the
trajectory for $\psi^{(1)}$, namely $\psi^{(1)}(t_{n+1})$; similarly,
we will start the trajectory for $\psi^{(3)}$ start at the end point
of the trajectory for $\psi^{(2)}$, namely $\psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1})$. This
method is then called "Lie splitting" and has the same order of error
as the method above, i.e., the splitting error is ${\cal O}(\Delta
t)$.

This variation of operator splitting can be written as
follows (carefully compare the initial conditions to the ones above):
@f{align*}{
  \frac{d\psi^{(1)}}{dt}
  &=
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(1)},
  \qquad
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(1)}(t_n) &= \psi(t_n),
\\
  \frac{d\psi^{(2)}}{dt}
  &=
  -i V \psi^{(2)},
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(2)}(t_n) &= \psi^{(1)}(t_{n+1}),
\\
  \frac{d\psi^{(3)}}{dt}
  &=
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(3)}|^2 \,\psi^{(3)},
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(3)}(t_n) &= \psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1}).
@f}
(Obviously, while the formulas above imply that we should solve these
problems in this particular order, it is equally valid to first solve
for trajectory 3, then 2, then 1, or any other permutation.)

The integrated forms of these equations are then
@f{align*}{
  \psi^{(1)}(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi(t_n)
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(1)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt,
\\
  \psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi^{(1)}(t_{n+1})
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i V \psi^{(2)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt,
\\
  \psi^{(3)}(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1})
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(3)}(t)|^2 \,\psi^{(3)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt.
@f}
From a practical perspective, this has the advantage that we need
to keep around fewer solution vectors: Once $\psi^{(1)}(t_n)$ has been
computed, we don't need $\psi(t_n)$ any more; once $\psi^{(2)}(t_n)$
has been computed, we don't need $\psi^{(1)}(t_n)$ any more. And once
$\psi^{(3)}(t_n)$ has been computed, we can just call it
$\psi(t_{n+1})$ because, if you insert the first into the second, and
then into the third equation, you see that the right hand side of
$\psi^{(3)}(t_n)$ now contains the contributions of all three physical
effects:
@f{align*}{
  \psi^{(3)}(t_{n+1})
  &=
  \psi(t_n)
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(1)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt
  +
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i V \psi^{(2)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt+
  \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}
  \left(
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(3)}(t)|^2 \,\psi^{(3)}(t)
  \right)
  \;
  dt.
@f}
(Compare this again with the "exact" computation of $\psi(t_{n+1})$:
It only differs in how we approximate $\psi(t)$ in each of the three integrals.)
In other words, Lie splitting is a lot simpler to implement that the
original method outlined above because data handling is so much
simpler.


<h3>Operator splitting: the "Strang splitting" approach</h3>

As mentioned above, Lie splitting is only ${\cal O}(\Delta t)$
accurate. This is acceptable if we were to use a first order time
discretization, for example using the explicit or implicit Euler
methods to solve the differential equations for $\psi^{(k)}$. This is
because these time integration methods introduce an error proportional
to $\Delta t$ themselves, and so the splitting error is proportional
to an error that we would introduce anyway, and does not diminish the
overall convergence order.

But we typically want to use something higher order -- say, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank%E2%80%93Nicolson_method">Crank-Nicolson</a>
or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_differentiation_formula">BDF2</a>
method -- since these are often not more expensive than a
simple Euler method. It would be a shame if we were to use a time
stepping method that is ${\cal O}(\Delta t^2)$, but then lose the
accuracy again through the operator splitting.

This is where the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strang_splitting">Strang
splitting</a> method comes in. It is easier to explain if we had only
two parts, and so let us combine the effects of the Laplace operator
and of the potential into one, and the phase rotation into a second
effect. (Indeed, this is what we will do in the code since solving the
equation with the Laplace equation with or without the potential costs
the same -- so we merge these two steps.) The Lie splitting method
from above would then do the following: It computes solutions of the
following two ODEs,
@f{align*}{
  \frac{d\psi^{(1)}}{dt}
  &=
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(1)} -i V \psi^{(1)},
  \qquad
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(1)}(t_n) &= \psi(t_n),
\\
  \frac{d\psi^{(2)}}{dt}
  &=
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(2)}|^2 \,\psi^{(2)},
  &
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(2)}(t_n) &= \psi^{(1)}(t_{n+1}),
@f}
and then uses the approximation $\psi(t_{n+1}) \approx
\psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1})$. In other words, we first make one full time step
for physical effect one, then one full time step for physical effect
two. The solution at the end of the time step is simply the sum of the
increments due to each of these physical effects separately.

In contrast,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Strang">Gil Strang</a>
(one of the titans of numerical analysis starting in the mid-20th
century) figured out that it is more accurate to first do
one half-step for one physical effect, then a full time step for the
other physical effect, and then another half step for the first. Which
one is which does not matter, but because it is so simple to do the
phase rotation, we will use this effect for the half steps and then
only need to do one spatial solve with the Laplace operator plus
potential. This operator splitting method is now ${\cal O}(\Delta
t^2)$ accurate. Written in formulas, this yields the following
sequence of steps:
@f{align*}{
  \frac{d\psi^{(1)}}{dt}
  &=
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(1)}|^2 \,\psi^{(1)},
  &&
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_n+\tfrac 12\Delta t),
  \qquad\qquad&\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(1)}(t_n) &= \psi(t_n),
\\
  \frac{d\psi^{(2)}}{dt}
  &=
  i\frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(2)} -i V \psi^{(2)},
  \qquad
  &&
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad&\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(2)}(t_n) &= \psi^{(1)}(t_n+\tfrac 12\Delta t),
\\
  \frac{d\psi^{(3)}}{dt}
  &=
  -i\kappa |\psi^{(3)}|^2 \,\psi^{(3)},
  &&
  \text{for}\; t \in (t_n+\tfrac 12\Delta t,t_{n+1}),
  \qquad\qquad&\text{with initial condition}\;
  \psi^{(3)}(t_n) &= \psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1}).
@f}
As before, the first and third step can be computed exactly for this
particular equation, yielding
@f{align*}{
  \psi^{(1)}(t_n+\tfrac 12\Delta t) &= e^{-i\kappa|\psi(t_n)|^2 \tfrac
  12\Delta t} \; \psi(t_n),
  \\
  \psi^{(3)}(t_{n+1}) &= e^{-i\kappa|\psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1})|^2 \tfrac
  12\Delta t} \; \psi^{(2)}(t_{n+1}).
@f}

This is then how we are going to implement things in this program:
In each time step, we execute three steps, namely
- Update the solution value at each node by analytically integrating
  the phase rotation equation by one half time step;
- Solving the space-time equation that corresponds to the full step
  for $\psi^{(2)}$, namely
  $-i\frac{\partial\psi^{(2)}}{\partial t}
  -
  \frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(2)} + V \psi^{(2)} = 0$,
  with initial conditions equal to the solution of the first half step
  above.
- Update the solution value at each node by analytically integrating
  the phase rotation equation by another half time step.

This structure will be reflected in an obvious way in the main time
loop of the program.



<h3>Time discretization</h3>

From the discussion above, it should have become clear that the only
partial differential equation we have to solve in each time step is
@f{align*}{
  -i\frac{\partial\psi^{(2)}}{\partial t}
  -
  \frac 12 \Delta \psi^{(2)} + V \psi^{(2)} = 0.
@f}
This equation is linear. Furthermore, we only have to solve it from
$t_n$ to $t_{n+1}$, i.e., for exactly one time step.

To do this, we will apply the second order accurate Crank-Nicolson
scheme that we have already used in some of the other time dependent
codes (specifically: step-23 and step-26). It reads as follows:
@f{align*}{
  -i\frac{\psi^{(n,2)}-\psi^{(n,1)}}{k_{n+1}}
  -
  \frac 12 \Delta \left[\frac 12
  \left(\psi^{(n,2)}+\psi^{(n,1)}\right)\right]
  +
  V \left[\frac 12 \left(\psi^{(n,2)}+\psi^{(n,1)}\right)\right] = 0.
@f}
Here, the "previous" solution $\psi^{(n,1)}$ (or the "initial
condition" for this part of the time step) is the output of the
first phase rotation half-step; the output of the current step will
be denoted by $\psi^{(n,2)}$. $k_{n+1}=t_{n+1}-t_n$ is
the length of the time step. (One could argue whether $\psi^{(n,1)}$
and $\psi^{(n,1)}$ live at time step $n$ or $n+1$ and what their upper
indices should be. This is a philosophical discussion without practical
impact, and one might think of $\psi^{(n,1)}$ as something like
$\psi^{(n+\tfrac 13)}$, and $\psi^{(n,2)}$ as
$\psi^{(n+\tfrac 23)}$ if that helps clarify things -- though, again
$n+\frac 13$ is not to be understood as "one third time step after
$t_n$" but more like "we've already done one third of the work necessary
for time step $n+1$".)

If we multiply the whole equation with $k_{n+1}$ and sort terms with
the unknown $\psi^{(n+1,2)}$ to the left and those with the known
$\psi^{(n,2)}$ to the right, then we obtain the following (spatial)
partial differential equation that needs to be solved in each time
step:
@f{align*}{
  -i\psi^{(n,2)}
  -
  \frac 14 k_{n+1} \Delta \psi^{(n,2)}
  +
  \frac 12 k_{n+1} V \psi^{(n,2)}
  =
  -i\psi^{(n,1)}
  +
  \frac 14 k_{n+1} \Delta \psi^{(n,1)}
  -
  \frac 12 k_{n+1} V \psi^{(n,1)}.

<h3>Spatial discretization and dealing with complex variables</h3>

As mentioned above, the previous tutorial program dealing with
complex-valued solutions (namely, step-29) separated real and imaginary
parts of the solution. It thus reduced everything to real
arithmetic. In contrast, we here want to keep things
complex-valued.

The first part of this is that we need to define the discretized
solution as $\psi_h^n(\mathbf x)=\sum_j \Psi^n_j \varphi_j(\mathbf
x) \approx \psi(\mathbf x,t_n)$ where the $\varphi_j$ are the usual shape functions (which are
real valued) but the expansion coefficients $\Psi^n_j$ at time step
$n$ are now complex-valued. This is easily done in deal.II: We just
have to use Vector<std::complex<double>> instead of Vector<double> to
store these coefficients.

Of more interest is how to build and solve the linear
system. Obviously, this will only be necessary for the second step of
the Strang splitting discussed above, with the time discretization of
the previous subsection. We obtain the fully discrete version through
straightforward substitution of $\psi^n$ by $\psi^n_h$ and
multiplication by a test function:
@f{align*}{
  -iM\Psi^{(n,2)}
  +
  \frac 14 k_{n+1} A \Psi^{(n,2)}
  +
  \frac 12 k_{n+1} W \Psi^{(n,2)}
  =
  -iM\Psi^{(n+1,1)}
  -
  \frac 14 k_{n+1} A \Psi^{(n,1)}
  -
  \frac 12 k_{n+1} W \Psi^{(n,1)},
@f}
or written in a more compact way:
@f{align*}{
  \left[
    -iM
    +
    \frac 14 k_{n+1} A
    +
    \frac 12 k_{n+1} W
  \right] \Psi^{(n,2)}
  =
  \left[
    -iM
    -
    \frac 14 k_{n+1} A
    -
   \frac 12 k_{n+1} W
  \right] \Psi^{(n,1)}.
@f}
Here, the matrices are defined in their obvious ways:
@f{align*}{
  M_{ij} &= (\varphi_i,\varphi_j), \\
  A_{ij} &= (\nabla\varphi_i,\nabla\varphi_j), \\
  W_{ij} &= (\varphi_i,V \varphi_j).
@f}
Note that all matrices individually are in fact symmetric,
real-valued, and at least positive semidefinite, though the same is
obviously not true for
the system matrix $C = -iM + \frac 14 k_{n+1} A + \frac 12 k_{n+1} W$
and the corresponding matrix
$R = -iM - \frac 14 k_{n+1} A - \frac 12 k_{n+1} W$
on the right hand side.


<h3>Linear solvers</h3>

@dealiiVideoLecture{34}

The only remaining important question about the solution procedure is
how to solve the complex-valued linear system
@f{align*}{
  C \Psi^{(n+1,2)}
  =
  R \Psi^{(n+1,1)},
@f}
with the matrix $C = -iM + \frac 14 k_{n+1} A + \frac 12 k_{n+1}
W$ and a right hand side that is easily computed as the product of
a known matrix and the previous part-step's solution.
As usual, this comes down to the question of what properties the
matrix $C$ has. If it is symmetric and positive definite, then we can
for example use the Conjugate Gradient method.

Unfortunately, the matrix's only useful property is that it is complex
symmetric, i.e., $C_{ij}=C_{ji}$, as is easy to see by recalling that
$M,A,W$ are all symmetric. It is not, however,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix">Hermitian</a>,
which would require that $C_{ij}=\bar C_{ji}$ where the bar indicates complex
conjugation.

Complex symmetry can be exploited for iterative solvers as a quick
literature search indicates. We will here not try to become too
sophisticated (and indeed leave this to the
@ref step_58-Extensions "Possibilities for extensions" section below) and
instead simply go with the good old standby for problems without
properties: A direct solver. That's not optimal, especially for large
problems, but it shall suffice for the purposes of a tutorial program.
Fortunately, the SparseDirectUMFPACK class allows solving complex-valued
problems.


<h3>Definition of the test case</h3>

Initial conditions for the NLSE are typically chosen to represent
particular physical situations. This is beyond the scope of this
program, but suffice it to say that these initial conditions are
(i) often superpositions of the wave functions of particles located
at different points, and that (ii) because $|\psi(\mathbf x,t)|^2$
corresponds to a particle density function, the integral
@f[
  N(t) = \int_\Omega |\psi(\mathbf x,t)|^2
@f]
corresponds to the number of particles in the system. (Clearly, if
one were to be physically correct, $N(t)$ better be a constant if
the system is closed, or $\frac{dN}{dt}<0$ if one has absorbing
boundary conditions.) The important point is that one should choose
initial conditions so that
@f[
  N(0) = \int_\Omega |\psi_0(\mathbf x)|^2
@f]
makes sense.

What we will use here, primarily because it makes for good graphics,
is the following:
@f[
  \psi_0(\mathbf x) = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^4 \alpha_k e^{-\frac{r_k^2}{R^2}}},
@f]
where $r_k = |\mathbf x-\mathbf x_k|$ is the distance from the (fixed)
locations $\mathbf x_k$, and
$\alpha_k$ are chosen so that each of the Gaussians that we are
adding up adds an integer number of particles to $N(0)$. We achieve
this by making sure that
@f[
  \int_\Omega \alpha_k e^{-\frac{r_k^2}{R^2}}
@f]
is a positive integer. In other words, we need to choose $\alpha$
as an integer multiple of
@f[
  \left(\int_\Omega e^{-\frac{r_k^2}{R^2}}\right)^{-1}
  =
  \left(R^d\sqrt{\pi^d}\right)^{-1},
@f]
assuming for the moment that $\Omega={\mathbb R}^d$ -- which is
of course not the case, but we'll ignore the small difference in
integral.

Thus, we choose $\alpha_k=\left(R^d\sqrt{\pi^d}\right)^{-1}$ for all, and
$R=0.1$. This $R$ is small enough that the difference between the
exact (infinite) integral and the integral over $\Omega$ should not be
too concerning.
We choose the four points $\mathbf x_k$ as $(\pm 0.3, 0), (0, \pm
0.3)$ -- also far enough away from the boundary of $\Omega$ to keep
ourselves on the safe side.

For simplicity, we pose the problem on the square $[-1,1]^2$. For
boundary conditions, we will use time-independent Neumann conditions of the
form
@f[
  \nabla\psi(\mathbf x,t)\cdot \mathbf n=0 \qquad\qquad \forall \mathbf x\in\partial\Omega.
@f]
This is not a realistic choice of boundary conditions but sufficient
for what we want to demonstrate here. We will comment further on this
in the @ref step_58-Extensions "Possibilities for extensions" section below.

Finally, we choose $\kappa=1$, and the potential as
@f[
  V(\mathbf x)
  =
  \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if}\; |\mathbf x|<0.7
                \\
                1000 & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
@f]
Using a large potential makes sure that the wave function $\psi$ remains
small outside the circle of radius 0.7. All of the Gaussians that make
up the initial conditions are within this circle, and the solution will
mostly oscillate within it, with a small amount of energy radiating into
the outside. The use of a large potential also makes sure that the nonphysical
boundary condition does not have too large an effect.
