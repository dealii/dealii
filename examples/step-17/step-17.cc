#include <deal.II/numerics/matrix_tools.h>
#include <deal.II/numerics/data_out.h>
#include <deal.II/numerics/error_estimator.h>

// And here come the things that we need particularly for this example program
// and that weren't in step-8. First, we replace the standard output
// <code>std::cout</code> by a new stream <code>pcout</code> which is used in
// parallel computations for generating output only on one of the MPI
// processes.
#include <deal.II/base/conditional_ostream.h>
// We are going to query the number of processes and the number of the present
// process by calling the respective functions in the Utilities::MPI
// namespace.
#include <deal.II/base/mpi.h>
// Then, we are going to replace all linear algebra components that involve
// the (global) linear system by classes that wrap interfaces similar to our
// own linear algebra classes around what PETSc offers (PETSc is a library
// written in C, and deal.II comes with wrapper classes that provide the PETSc
// functionality with an interface that is similar to the interface we already
// had for our own linear algebra classes). In particular, we need vectors and
// matrices that are distributed across several
// @ref GlossMPIProcess "processes" in MPI programs (and
// simply map to sequential, local vectors and matrices if there is only a
// single process, i.e., if you are running on only one machine, and without
// MPI support):
#include <deal.II/lac/petsc_vector.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/petsc_sparse_matrix.h>
// Then we also need interfaces for solvers and preconditioners that PETSc
// provides:
#include <deal.II/lac/petsc_solver.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/petsc_precondition.h>
// And in addition, we need some algorithms for partitioning our meshes so
// that they can be efficiently distributed across an MPI network. The
// partitioning algorithm is implemented in the <code>GridTools</code>
// namespace, and we need an additional include file for a function in
// <code>DoFRenumbering</code> that allows to sort the indices associated with
// degrees of freedom so that they are numbered according to the subdomain
// they are associated with:
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_tools.h>
#include <deal.II/dofs/dof_renumbering.h>

// And this is simply C++ again:
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

// The last step is as in all previous programs:

  // @sect4{ElasticProblem::setup_system}

  // Next, the function in which we set up the various variables
  // for the global linear system to be solved needs to be implemented.
  //
  // However, before we proceed with this, there is one thing to do for a
  // parallel program: we need to determine which MPI process is
  // responsible for each of the cells. Splitting cells among
  // processes, commonly called "partitioning the mesh", is done by
  // assigning a @ref GlossSubdomainId "subdomain id" to each cell. We
  // do so by calling into the METIS library that does this in a very
  // efficient way, trying to minimize the number of nodes on the
  // interfaces between subdomains. Rather than trying to call METIS
  // directly, we do this by calling the
  // GridTools::partition_triangulation() function that does this at a
  // much higher level of programming.
  //
  // @note As mentioned in the introduction, we could avoid this manual
  //   partitioning step if we used the parallel::shared::Triangulation
  //   class for the triangulation object instead (as we do in step-18).
  //   That class does, in essence, everything a regular triangulation
  //   does, but it then also automatically partitions the mesh after
  //   every mesh creation or refinement operation.
  //
  // Following partitioning, we need to enumerate all degrees of
  // freedom as usual.  However, we would like to enumerate the
  // degrees of freedom in a way so that all degrees of freedom
  // associated with cells in subdomain zero (which resides on process
  // zero) come before all DoFs associated with cells on subdomain
  // one, before those on cells on process two, and so on. We need
  // this since we have to split the global vectors for right hand
  // side and solution, as well as the matrix into contiguous chunks
  // of rows that live on each of the processors, and we will want to
  // do this in a way that requires minimal communication. This
  // particular enumeration can be obtained by re-ordering degrees of
  // freedom indices using DoFRenumbering::subdomain_wise().
  //
  // The final step of this initial setup is that we get ourselves an
  // IndexSet that indicates the subset of the global number of unknowns
  // this
  // process is responsible for. (Note that a degree of freedom is not
  // necessarily owned by the process that owns a cell just because
  // the degree of freedom lives on this cell: some degrees of freedom
  // live on interfaces between subdomains, and are consequently only owned by
  // one of the processes adjacent to this interface.)
  //
  // Before we move on, let us recall a fact already discussed in the
  // introduction: The triangulation we use here is replicated across
  // all processes, and each process has a complete copy of the entire
  // triangulation, with all cells. Partitioning only provides a way
  // to identify which cells out of all each process "owns", but it
  // knows everything about all of them. Likewise, the DoFHandler
  // object knows everything about every cell, in particular the
  // degrees of freedom that live on each cell, whether it is one that
  // the current process owns or not. This can not scale to large
  // problems because eventually just storing the entire mesh, and
  // everything that is associated with it, on every process will
  // become infeasible if the problem is large enough. On the other
  // hand, if we split the triangulation into parts so that every
  // process stores only those cells it "owns" but nothing else (or,
  // at least a sufficiently small fraction of everything else), then
  // we can solve large problems if only we throw a large enough
  // number of MPI processes at them. This is what we are going to in
  // step-40, for example, using the
  // parallel::distributed::Triangulation class.  On the other hand,
  // most of the rest of what we demonstrate in the current program
  // will actually continue to work whether we have the entire
  // triangulation available, or only a piece of it.

  // @sect4{ElasticProblem::assemble_system}

  // We now assemble the matrix and right hand side of the
  // problem. There are some things worth mentioning before we go into
  // detail. First, we will be assembling the system in parallel,
  // i.e., each process will be responsible for assembling on cells
  // that belong to this particular process. Note that the degrees of
  // freedom are split in a way such that all DoFs in the interior of
  // cells and between cells belonging to the same subdomain belong to
  // the process that <code>owns</code> the cell. However, even then
  // we sometimes need to assemble on a cell with a neighbor that
  // belongs to a different process, and in these cases when we add up
  // the local contributions into the global matrix or right hand side
  // vector, we have to transfer these entries to the process that
  // owns these elements. Fortunately, we don't have to do this by
  // hand: PETSc does all this for us by caching these elements
  // locally, and sending them to the other processes as necessary
  // when we call the <code>compress()</code> functions on the matrix
  // and vector at the end of this function.
  //
  // The second point is that once we have handed over matrix and
  // vector contributions to PETSc, it is a) hard, and b) very
  // inefficient to get them back for modifications. This is not only
  // the fault of PETSc, it is also a consequence of the distributed
  // nature of this program: if an entry resides on another processor,
  // then it is necessarily expensive to get it. The consequence of
  // this is that we should not try to first assemble the matrix and
  // right hand side as if there were no hanging node constraints and
  // boundary values, and then eliminate these in a second step
  // (using, for example, AffineConstraints::condense()). Rather, we
  // should try to eliminate hanging node constraints before handing
  // these entries over to PETSc. This is easy: instead of copying
  // elements by hand into the global matrix (as we do in step-4), we
  // use the AffineConstraints::distribute_local_to_global() functions
  // to take care of hanging nodes at the same time. We also already
  // did this in step-6. The second step, elimination of boundary
  // nodes, could also be done this way by putting the boundary values
  // into the same AffineConstraints object as hanging nodes (see the
  // way it is done in step-6, for example); however, it is not
  // strictly necessary to do this here because eliminating boundary
  // values can be done with only the data stored on each process
  // itself, and consequently we use the approach used before in
  // step-4, i.e., via MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values().
  //
  // All of this said, here is the actual implementation starting with
  // the general setup of helper variables.  (Note that we still use

  //
  // At the top of the function, we set up a convergence monitor, and

  // matrices. And finally a preconditioner; we choose to use a block
  // Jacobi preconditioner which works by computing an incomplete LU
  // decomposition on each diagonal block of the matrix.  (In other
  // words, each MPI process computes an ILU from the rows it stores
  // by throwing away columns that correspond to row indices not
  // stored locally; this yields a square matrix block from which we
  // can compute an ILU. That means that if you run the program with
  // only one process, then you will use an ILU(0) as a
  // preconditioner, while if it is run on many processes, then we
  // will have a number of blocks on the diagonal and the
  // preconditioner is the ILU(0) of each of these blocks. In the
  // extreme case of one degree of freedom per processor, this
  // preconditioner is then simply a Jacobi preconditioner since the
  // diagonal matrix blocks consist of only a single entry. Such a
  // preconditioner is relatively easy to compute because it does not
  // require any kind of communication between processors, but it is
  // in general not very efficient for large numbers of processors.)

    // example, for a Q1 element in 2d, we need access to the two nodes on the
    // big side of a hanging node face, to compute the value of the
    // constrained node in the middle).
    //
    // The problem is that we have built our vectors (in
    // <code>setup_system()</code>) in such a way that every process
    // is responsible for storing only those elements of the solution
    // vector that correspond to the degrees of freedom this process
    // "owns". There are, however, cases where in order to compute the
    // value of the vector entry for a constrained degree of freedom
    // on one process, we need to access vector entries that are
    // stored on other processes.  PETSc (and, for that matter, the
    // MPI model on which it is built) does not allow to simply query
    // vector entries stored on other processes, so what we do here is
    // to get a copy of the "distributed" vector where we store all
    // elements locally. This is simple, since the deal.II wrappers
    // have a conversion constructor for the deal.II Vector
    // class. (This conversion of course requires communication, but

    // corresponding to degrees of freedom that are owned by this

  // @sect4{ElasticProblem::refine_grid}

  // Using some kind of refinement indicator, the mesh can be
  // refined. The problem is basically the same as with distributing
  // hanging node constraints: in order to compute the error indicator
  // (even if we were just interested in the indicator on the cells
  // the current process owns), we need access to more elements of the
  // solution vector than just those the current processor stores. To
  // make this happen, we do essentially what we did in
  // <code>solve()</code> already, namely get a <i>complete</i> copy
  // of the solution vector onto every process, and use that to
  // compute. This is in itself expensive as explained above and it
  // is particular unnecessary since we had just created and then
  // destroyed such a vector in <code>solve()</code>, but efficiency
  // is not the point of this program and so let us opt for a design
  // in which every function is as self-contained as possible.
  //
  // Once we have such a "localized" vector that contains <i>all</i>
  // elements of the solution vector, we can compute the indicators
  // for the cells that belong to the present process. In fact, we
  // could of course compute <i>all</i> refinement indicators since
  // our Triangulation and DoFHandler objects store information about
  // all cells, and since we have a complete copy of the solution
  // vector. But in the interest in showing how to operate in
  // %parallel, let us demonstrate how one would operate if one were
  // to only compute <i>some</i> error indicators and then exchange
  // the remaining ones with the other processes. (Ultimately, each
  // process needs a complete set of refinement indicators because
  // every process needs to refine their mesh, and needs to refine it
  // in exactly the same way as all of the other processes.)
  //
  // So, to do all of this, we need to:
  // - First, get a local copy of the distributed solution vector.
  // - Second, create a vector to store the refinement indicators.
  // - Third, let the KellyErrorEstimator compute refinement
  //   indicators for all cells belonging to the present
  //   subdomain/process. The last argument of the call indicates
  //   which subdomain we are interested in. The three arguments
  //   before it are various other default arguments that one usually
  //   does not need (and does not state values for, but rather uses the
  //   defaults), but which we have to state here explicitly since we
  //   want to modify the value of a following argument (i.e., the one
  //   indicating the subdomain).

    // cells and stored them in the respective elements of the
    // <code>local_error_per_cell</code> vector. The elements of this
    // vector for cells not owned by the present process are
    // zero. However, since all processes have a copy of the entire
    // triangulation and need to keep these copies in sync, they need
    // the values of refinement indicators for all cells of the
    // triangulation. Thus, we need to distribute our results. We do
    // this by creating a distributed vector where each process has
    // its share and sets the elements it has computed. Consequently,
    // when you view this vector as one that lives across all
    // processes, then every element of this vector has been set
    // once. We can then assign this parallel vector to a local,
    // non-parallel vector on each process, making <i>all</i> error
    // indicators available on every process.
    //
    // So in the first step, we need to set up a parallel vector. For
    // simplicity, every process will own a chunk with as many
    // elements as this process owns cells, so that the first chunk of
    // elements is stored with process zero, the next chunk with
    // process one, and so on. It is important to remark, however,
    // that these elements are not necessarily the ones we will write
    // to. This is a consequence of the order in which cells are arranged,
    // i.e., the order in which the elements of the vector correspond
    // to cells is not ordered according to the subdomain these cells
    // belong to. In other words, if on this process we compute
    // indicators for cells of a certain subdomain, we may write the
    // results to more or less random elements of the distributed
    // vector; in particular, they may not necessarily lie within the
    // chunk of vector we own on the present process. They will
    // subsequently have to be copied into another process' memory
    // space, an operation that PETSc does for us when we call the
    // <code>compress()</code> function. This inefficiency could be
    // avoided with some more code, but we refrain from it since it is
    // not a major factor in the program's total runtime.
    //
    // So here is how we do it: count how many cells belong to this
    // process, set up a distributed vector with that many elements to
    // be stored locally, copy over the elements we computed
    // locally, and finally compress the result. In fact, we really only copy
    // the elements that are nonzero, so we may miss a few that we
    // computed to zero, but this won't hurt since the original values
    // of the vector are zero anyway.

  // The final function of significant interest is the one that
  // creates graphical output. This works the same way as in step-8,
  // with two small differences. Before discussing these, let us state
  // the general philosophy this function will work: we intend for all
  // of the data to be generated on a single process, and subsequently
  // written to a file. This is, as many other parts of this program
  // already discussed, not something that will scale. Previously, we
  // had argued that we will get into trouble with triangulations,
  // DoFHandlers, and copies of the solution vector where every
  // process has to store all of the data, and that there will come to
  // be a point where each process simply doesn't have enough memory
  // to store that much data. Here, the situation is different: it's
  // not only the memory, but also the run time that's a problem. If
  // one process is responsible for processing <i>all</i> of the data
  // while all of the other processes do nothing, then this one
  // function will eventually come to dominate the overall run time of
  // the program.  In particular, the time this function takes is
  // going to be proportional to the overall size of the problem
  // (counted in the number of cells, or the number of degrees of
  // freedom), independent of the number of processes we throw at it.
  //
  // Such situations need to be avoided, and we will show in step-18
  // and step-40 how to address this issue. For the current problem,
  // the solution is to have each process generate output data only
  // for its own local cells, and write them to separate files, one
  // file per process. This is how step-18 operates. Alternatively,
  // one could simply leave everything in a set of independent files
  // and let the visualization software read all of them (possibly
  // also using multiple processors) and create a single visualization
  // out of all of them; this is the path step-40, step-32, and all
  // other parallel programs developed later on take.
  //
  // More specifically for the current function, all processes call
  // this function, but not all of them need to do the work associated
  // with generating output. In fact, they shouldn't, since we would
  // try to write to the same file multiple times at once. So we let
  // only the first process do this, and all the other ones idle
  // around during this time (or start their work for the next
  // iteration, or simply yield their CPUs to other jobs that happen
  // to run at the same time). The second thing is that we not only
  // output the solution vector, but also a vector that indicates
  // which subdomain each cell belongs to. This will make for some
  // nice pictures of partitioned domains.
  //
  // To implement this, process zero needs a complete set of solution
  // components in a local vector. Just as with the previous function,
  // the efficient way to do this would be to re-use the vector
  // already created in the <code>solve()</code> function, but to keep
  // things more self-contained, we simply re-create one here from the
  // distributed solution vector.
  //
  // An important thing to realize is that we do this localization operation
  // on all processes, not only the one that actually needs the data. This
  // can't be avoided, however, with the simplified communication model of MPI
  // we use for vectors in this tutorial program: MPI does not have a way to
  // query data on another process, both sides have to initiate a
  // communication at the same time. So even though most of the processes do
  // not need the localized solution, we have to place the statement
  // converting the distributed into a localized vector so that all processes
  // execute it.
  //
  // (Part of this work could in fact be avoided. What we do is
  // send the local parts of all processes to all other processes. What we
  // would really need to do is to initiate an operation on all processes
  // where each process simply sends its local chunk of data to process
  // zero, since this is the only one that actually needs it, i.e., we need
  // something like a gather operation. PETSc can do this, but for
  // simplicity's sake we don't attempt to make use of this here. We don't,
  // since what we do is not very expensive in the grand scheme of things:
  // it is one vector communication among all processes, which has to be
  // compared to the number of communications we have to do when solving the
