<h1>Results</h1>

This section sketches how to reproduce the validation scenarios discussed in the
SEMA paper with this code. The program expects a parameter file on the command
line; if none is provided it will generate a default `parameters.prm` matching
the current dimension and co-dimension.

<h3>Setup checklist</h3>

- Choose dimension (`dimension`, `space dimension`) and mesh generators for
  fluid, solid, and tracer particles in `Navier-Stokes Immersed Problem/`.
- Pick material parameters (`Viscosity`, `Density`, `Lame mu`, `Lame lambda`)
  consistent with the intended test.
- Prescribe boundary data in `Navier-Stokes boundary conditions` and initial
  conditions for fluid and solid.
- Set `Number of time steps`, `Final time`, and `Output frequency`.


<h3>Compressed disk recovery</h3>

A neo-Hookean disk compressed to $\lambda_0 R$ is released in a quiescent box.
Record:
- Position of the disk center over time.
- Volume of the disk versus cumulative fluid flux across the open boundary.
- Sensitivity to mesh refinement (`Initial fluid/solid refinement`).


<h3>Annulus inflation with a point source</h3>

An annulus immersed in a box is inflated by a mass source at the center. Track:
- Growth of mean normal stress and deformation of the ring.
- Difference between injected fluid volume and solid volume loss as an error
  indicator for different refinement levels.


<h3>What to report</h3>

- Plots of the metrics above versus time, including convergence with respect to
  spatial refinements.
- Wall-clock timings from `TimerOutput` to compare assembly and solver costs.
- Notes on stability of the distributed Lagrange multiplier coupling for the
  chosen parameters.
