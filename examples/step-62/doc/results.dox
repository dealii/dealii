A phononic cavity is characterized by the
[resonance frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance) and the
[the quality factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor).
The quality factor is equal to the ratio between the stored energy in the resonator and the energy
dissipated energy per cycle, which is approximately equivalent to the ratio between the
resonance frequency and the
[full width at half maximum (FWHM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_width_at_half_maximum).
The FWHM is equal to the bandwidth over which the power of vibration is greater than half the
power at the resonant frequency.
@f[
Q = \frac{f_r}{\Delta f} = \frac{\omega_r}{\Delta \omega} =
2 \pi \times \frac{\text{energy stored}}{\text{energy dissipated per cycle}}
@f]

The square of the amplitude of the mechanical resonance $a^2$ as a function of the frequency
has a gaussian shape
@f[
a^2 = a_\textrm{max}^2\frac{\omega^2\Gamma^2}{(\omega_r^2-\omega^2)^2+\Gamma^2\omega^2}
@f]
where $f_r = \frac{\omega_r}{2\pi}$ is the resonance frequency and $\Gamma=\frac{\omega_r}{Q}$ is the dissipation rate.
We used the previous equation in the Jupyter Notebook to fit the mechanical resonance.

Given the values we have chosen for the parameters, one could estimate the resonance frequency
analytically. Indeed, this is then confirmed by what we get in this program:
the phononic superlattice cavity exhibits a mechanical resonance at 20GHz and a quality factor of 5046.
The following images show the transmission amplitude and phase as a function of frequency in the
vicinity of the resonance frequency:

<img alt="Phononic superlattice cavity" src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-62.06.png" height="400" />

The images above suggest that the periodic structure has its intended effect: It really only lets waves of a very
specific frequency pass through, whereas all other waves are reflected. This is of course precisely what one builds
these sorts of devices for.
But it is not quite this easy. In practice, there is really only a "band gap", i.e., the device blocks waves other than
the desired one at 20GHz only within a certain frequency range. Indeed, to find out how large this "gap" is within
which waves are blocked, we can extend the frequency range to 16 GHz through the appropriate parameters in the
input file. We then obtain the following image:

<img alt="Phononic superlattice cavity" src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-62.07.png" height="400" />

What this image suggests is that in the range of around 18 to around 22 GHz, really only the waves with a frequency
of 20 GHz are allowed to pass through, but beyond this range, there are plenty of other frequencies that can pass
through the device.

<h3>Mode profile</h3>

We can inspect the mode profile with Paraview or VisIt.
As we have discussed, at resonance all the mechanical
energy is transmitted and the amplitude of motion is amplified inside the cavity.
It can be observed that the PMLs are quite effective to truncate the solution.
The following image shows the mode profile at resonance:

<img alt="Phononic superlattice cavity" src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-62.08.png" height="400" />

On the other hand,  out of resonance all the mechanical energy is
reflected. The following image shows the profile at 19.75 GHz.
Note the interference between the force pulse and the reflected wave
at the position $x=-8\mu\textrm{m}$.

<h3>Experimental applications</h3>

Phononic superlattice cavities find application in
[quantum optomechanics](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.86.1391).
Here we have presented the simulation of a 2D superlattice cavity,
but this code can be used as well to simulate "real world" 3D devices such as
[micropillar superlattice cavities](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.060101),
which are promising candidates to study macroscopic quantum phenomena.
The 20GHz mode of a micropillar superlattice cavity is essentially a mechanical harmonic oscillator that is very well isolated
from the environment. If the device is cooled down to 20mK in a dilution fridge, the mode would then become a
macroscopic quantum harmonic oscillator.


<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

Instead of setting the parameters in the C++ file we could set the parameters
using a Python script and save them in the HDF5 file that we will use for
the simulations. Then the deal.II program will read the parameters from the
HDF5 file.

In order to read the HDF5 parameters we have to use the
HDF5::File::FileAccessMode::open flag.
@code{.py}
      HDF5::File data_file("results.h5",
