<h1>Introduction</h1>
A phononic crystal is a periodic nanostructure that modifies the motion of
mechanical vibrations or [phonons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonon).
Phononic structures can be used to disperse, route and confine mechanical vibrations.
These structures have potential applications in
[quantum information](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.86.1391)
and have been used to study
[macroscopic quantum phenomena](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6360/203).
Phononic crystals are usually fabricated in
[cleanrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanroom).

In this tutorial we show how to a design a
[phononic superlattice cavity](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.033813)
which is a particular type of phononic crystal that can be used to confine
mechanical vibrations. A phononic superlattice cavity is formed by two
[Distributed Bragg Reflector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Bragg_reflector),
mirrors and a $\lambda/2$ cavity where $\lambda$ is the acoustic
wavelength. Acoustic DBRs are  periodic structures where a set of bilayer
stacks with contrasting physical properties (sound velocity index) is
repeated $N$ times.
Superlattice cavities are usually grown on a
[Gallium Arsenide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_arsenide)
wafer by
[Molecular Beam Epitaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular-beam_epitaxy).
The bilayers correspond to GaAs/AlAs mirror pairs.
As shown below, the thickness of the mirror layers (brown and green) is
$\lambda/4$ and the thickness of the cavity (blue) is $\lambda/2$.

In this tutorial we calculate the
[band gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap) and the
mechanical resonance of a phononic superlattice cavity but the code presented here
can be easily used to design and calculate other types of
[phononic crystals](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6360/203).

The device is a waveguide in which the wave goes from left to right.
The simulations of this tutorial are done in 2D, but the code is dimension
independent and can be easily used with 3D simulations.
The waveguide width is equal to the $y$ dimension of the domain and the
waveguide length is equal to the $x$ dimension of the domain.
There are two regimes that depend on the waveguide width:
- Single mode: In this case the width of the structure is much
  smaller than the wavelength.
  This case can be solved either with FEM (the approach that we take here) or with
  a simple semi-analytical
  [1D transfer matrix formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_matrix).
- Multimode: In this case the width of the structure is larger than the wavelength.
  This case can be solved using FEM
  or with a [scattering matrix formalism](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.033813).
  Although we do not study this case in this tutorial, it is very easy to reach the multimode
  regime by increasing the parameter waveguide width (`dimension_y` in the jupyter notebook).

The simulations of this tutorial are performed in the frequency domain.
To calculate the transmission spectrum, we use a
[procedure](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/Resonant_Modes_and_Transmission_in_a_Waveguide_Cavity/)
that is commonly used in time domain [FDTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method)
simulations. A pulse at a certain frequency is generated on the left side of the
structure and the transmitted energy is measured on the right side of the structure.
The simulation is run twice. First, we run the simulation with the phononic
structure and measure the transmitted energy:

<img alt="Phononic superlattice cavity" src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-62.02.svg" height="200" />

Then, we run the simulation without the phononic structure and measure the transmitted
energy. We use the simulation without the structure for the calibration:

<img alt="Phononic superlattice cavity" src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-62.03.svg" height="200" />

The transmission coefficient corresponds to the energy of the first simulation
divided by the calibration energy.
We repeat this procedure for each frequency step.


<h3>Elastic equations</h3>
What we want to simulate here is the transmission of elastic
waves. Consequently, the right description of the problem uses the
elastic equations, which in the time domain are given by
@f[
\rho\partial_{tt} u_i - \partial_j (c_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{kl}) = f_i,
\qquad i=0,1,2
@f]
where the stiffness tensor $c_{ijkl}$ depends on the spatial coordinates and
the strain is the symmetrized gradient of the displacement, given by
@f[
\varepsilon_{kl} =\frac{1}{2}(\partial_k u_l + \partial_l u_k)
@f]

[A perfectly matched layer (PML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer)
can be used to truncate the solution at the boundaries.
A PML is a transformation that results in a complex coordinate
stretching.

Instead of a time domain approach, this tutorial program converts the
equations above into the frequency domain by performing a Fourier
transform with regard to the time variable.
The elastic equations in the frequency domain then read as follows
@f{eqnarray*}
\nabla\cdot(\boldsymbol{\bar\sigma} \xi \boldsymbol{\Lambda})&=&-\omega^2\rho\xi\mathbf{\bar u}\\
\boldsymbol{\bar \sigma} &=&\mathbf{C}\boldsymbol{\bar\varepsilon}\\
\boldsymbol{\bar\varepsilon}&=&\frac{1}{2}[(\nabla\mathbf{\bar{u}}\boldsymbol{\Lambda}+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}^\mathrm{T}(\nabla\mathbf{\bar{u}})^\mathrm{T})]\\
\xi &=&\prod_i^\textrm{dim}s_i\\
\boldsymbol{\Lambda} &=& \operatorname{diag}(1/s_0,1/s_1,1/s_2)\qquad\textrm{for 3D}\\
\boldsymbol{\Lambda} &=& \operatorname{diag}(1/s_0,1/s_1)\qquad\textrm{for 2D}
@f}
where the coefficients $s_i = 1+is_i'(x,y,z)$ account for the absorption.
There are 3 $s_i$ coefficients in 3D and 2 in 2D.
The imaginary par of $s_i$ is equal to zero outside the PML.
The PMLs are reflectionless only for the exact wave equations.
When the set of equations is discretized the PML is no longer reflectionless.
The reflections can be made arbitrarily small as long as the
medium is slowly varying, see
[the adiabatic theorem](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.66.066608).
In the code a quadratic turn-on of the PML has been used.
A linear and cubic turn-on is also
[known to work](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.16.011376).
These equations can be expanded into
@f[
-\omega^2\rho \xi  u_m - \partial_n \left(\frac{\xi}{s_n}c_{mnkl}
\varepsilon_{kl}\right) = f_m
@f]
@f[
\varepsilon_{kl} =\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{s_k}\partial_k u_l
+ \frac{1}{s_l}\partial_l u_k\right)
@f]
where summation over repeated indices (here $n$, as well as $k$ and $l$) is as always implied.
Note that the strain is no longer symmetric after applying the complex coordinate
stretching of the PML.
This set of equations can be written as
@f[
-\omega^2\rho \xi  u_m - \partial_n \left(\frac{\xi c_{mnkl}}{2s_n s_k} \partial_k u_l
+ \frac{\xi c_{mnkl}}{2s_n s_l} \partial_l u_k\right) = f_m
@f]

The same as the strain, the stress tensor is not symmetric inside the PML ($s_j\neq 0$).
Indeed the fields inside the PML are not physical.
It is useful to introduce the tensors $\alpha_{mnkl}$ and $\beta_{mnkl}$.
@f[
-\omega^2\rho \xi  u_m - \partial_n \left(\alpha_{mnkl}\partial_k u_l
+  \beta_{mnkl}\partial_l u_k\right) = f_m
@f]

We can multiply by $\varphi_m$ and integrate over the domain $\Omega$ and integrate by parts.
@f{eqnarray*}
-\omega^2\int_\Omega\rho\xi\varphi_m u_m + \int_\Omega\partial_n\varphi_m \left(\frac{\xi c_{mnkl}}{2s_n s_k} \partial_k u_l
+ \frac{\xi c_{mnkl}}{2s_n s_l} \partial_l u_k\right) = \int_\Omega\varphi_m f_m
@f}
It is this set of equations we want to solve for a set of frequencies $\omega$ in order to compute the
transmission coefficient as function of frequency.
The linear system becomes
@f{eqnarray*}
AU&=&F\\
A_{ij} &=& -\omega^2\int_\Omega\rho \xi\varphi_m^i \varphi_m^j + \int_\Omega\partial_n\varphi_m^i \left(\frac{\xi c_{mnkl}}{2s_n s_k} \partial_k \varphi_l^j
+ \frac{\xi c_{mnkl}}{2s_n s_l} \partial_l \varphi_k^j\right)\\
F_i &=& \int_\Omega\varphi_m^i f_m
@f}

<h3>Simulation parameters</h3>
In this tutorial we use a python
[jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dealii/dealii/blob/phononic-cavity/examples/step-62/step-62.ipynb)
to set up the parameters and run the simulation.
First we create a HDF5 file where we store the parameters and the results of
the simulation.

Each of the simulations (displacement and calibration) is stored in a separate HDF5 group:
