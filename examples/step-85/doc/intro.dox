<h3>The Cut Finite Element Method</h3>

In this example, we show how to use the cut finite element method (CutFEM) in deal.II.
For illustration, we want to solve the simplest possible problem,
so we again consider Poisson's equation:
@f{align*}{
  -\Delta u &= f \qquad && \text{in }\, \Omega,
  \\
  u &= u_D       \qquad && \text{on }\, \Gamma = \partial \Omega,
@f}
where we choose $f(x) = 4$ and $u_D(x) = 1$.
CutFEM is an immersed method.
In this context,
"immersed" means that the mesh is unfitted to the geometry of the domain, $\Omega$.
Instead, $\Omega$ floats freely on top of a uniform background mesh, $\mathcal{T}^h$.
@image html step-85-background-mesh.svg
Since we no longer use the mesh to describe the geometry of the domain,
we need some other way to represent it.
This can be done in several ways but here we assume that $\Omega$ is described by a level set function,
$\psi : \mathbb{R}^{\text{dim}} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
@f{align*}{
  \Omega &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{dim}} : \psi(x) < 0 \}, \\
  \Gamma &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{dim}} : \psi(x) = 0 \}.
@f}
For simplicity, we choose $\Omega$ to be a unit disk, so that
@f{equation*}{
  \psi(x) = \| x \| - 1.
@f}
As can be seen from the figure below,
the level set function is negative for points in $\Omega$,
zero on the boundary, and positive everywhere else.
@image html step-85-level-set.png
To solve this problem,
we want to distribute degrees of freedom over the smallest submesh, $\mathcal{T}_\Omega^h$,
that completely covers the domain:
@f{equation*}{
  \mathcal{T}_\Omega^h = \{ T \in \mathcal{T}^{h} : T \cap \Omega \neq \emptyset \}.
@f}
This is usually referred to as the "active mesh".
@image html step-85-active-mesh.svg
The finite element space where we want to find our numerical solution, $u_h$, is now
@f{equation*}{
  V_\Omega^h = \{ v \in C(\mathcal{N}_\Omega^h) : v \in Q_p(T), \, T \in \mathcal{T}_\Omega^h \},
@f}
where
@f{equation*}{
  \mathcal{N}_\Omega^h = \bigcup_{T \in \mathcal{T}_\Omega^h} \overline{T},
@f}
and $\overline{T}$ denotes the closure of $T$.
The set $\mathcal{N}_\Omega^h$ is sometimes referred to as the "fictitious domain".
Since $\Omega \subset \mathcal{N}_\Omega^h$,
we see that the numerical solution is defined over a slightly larger region than the analytical solution.

In this type of immersed finite element method,
the standard way to apply boundary conditions is using Nitsche's method.
Multiplying the PDE with a test function, $v_h \in V_\Omega^h$,
and integrating by parts over $\Omega$, as usual, gives us
@f{equation*}{
  (\nabla u_h, \nabla v_h)_\Omega - (\partial_n u_h, v_h)_\Gamma = (f,v)_\Omega.
@f}
Let $\gamma_D > 0$ be a scalar penalty parameter and let $h$ be some measure of the local cell size.
We now note that the following terms are consistent with the Dirichlet boundary condition:
@f{align*}{
  -(u_h, \partial_n v_h)_\Gamma &= -(u_D, \partial_n v_h)_\Gamma, \\
  \left (\frac{\gamma_D}{h} u_h, v_h \right )_\Gamma &= \left (\frac{\gamma_D}{h}u_D, v_h \right )_\Gamma.
@f}
Thus, we can add these to the weak formulation to enforce the boundary condition.
This leads to the following weak formulation:
Find $u_h \in V_\Omega^h$ such that
@f{equation*}{
  a_h(u_h, v_h) = L_h(v_h), \quad \forall v_h \in V_\Omega^h,
@f}
where
@f{align*}{
  a_h(u_h, v_h) &=  (\nabla u_h, \nabla v_h)_\Omega
                  - (\partial_n u_h, v_h)_\Gamma
                  - (u_h, \partial_n v_h)_\Gamma
                  + \left (\frac{\gamma_D}{h} u_h, v_h \right )_\Gamma,
  \\
  L_h(v_h)      &=  (f,v)_\Omega
                  + \left (u_D, \frac{\gamma_D}{h} v_h -\partial_n v_h \right )_\Gamma.
@f}
In this formulation, there is one big difference,
compared to a standard boundary-fitted finite element method.
On each cell,
we need to integrate over the part of the domain and the part of the boundary that falls within the cell.
Thus, on each cell intersected by $\Gamma$,
we need special quadrature rules that only integrate over these parts of the cell,
that is, over $T \cap \Omega$ and $T \cap \Gamma$.
@image html immersed_quadratures.svg
Since $\Omega \cap T$ is the part of the cell that lies inside the domain,
we shall refer to the following regions
@f{align*}{
  \{x \in T : \psi(x) < 0 \}, \\
  \{x \in T : \psi(x) > 0 \}, \\
  \{x \in T : \psi(x) = 0 \},
@f}
as the "inside", "outside" and the "surface region" of the cell $T$.

The above finite element method that uses the bilinear form $a_h(\cdot, \cdot)$
is sometimes referred to as the "naive weak formulation"
because it suffers from the so-called "small cut problem".
Depending on how $\Omega$ is located relative to $\mathcal{T}_h$,
a cut between a cell, $T \in \mathcal{T}_h$, and $\Omega$ can become arbitrarily small:
$|\Omega \cap T | \rightarrow 0$.
For Neumann boundary conditions,
the consequence is that the @ref GlossStiffnessMatrix "stiffness matrix" can become arbitrarily ill-conditioned
as the cut-size approaches zero.
For a Dirichlet condition, the situation is even worse.
For any finite choice of Nitsche constant, $\gamma_D$,
the bilinear form $a_h(\cdot,\cdot)$ loses coercivity as the size of a cell cut approaches zero.
This makes the above weak formulation essentially useless
because as we refine we typically can not control how the cells intersect $\Gamma$.
One way to avoid this problem is to add a so-called ghost penalty term, $g_h$,
to the weak formulation (see e.g. @cite burman_hansbo_2012 and @cite cutfem_2015).
This leads to the stabilized cut finite element method,
which reads: Find $u_h \in V_\Omega^h$ such that
@f{equation*}{
  A_h(u_h, v_h) = L_h(v_h), \quad \forall v_h \in V_\Omega^h,
@f}
where
@f{equation*}{
  A_h(u_h,v_h) = a_h(u_h,v_h) + g_h(u_h, v_h).
@f}
The point of this ghost penalty is that it makes the numerical method essentially independent
of how $\Omega$ relates to the background mesh.
In particular, $A_h$ can be shown to be continuous and coercive,
with constants that do not depend on how $\Omega$ intersects $\mathcal{T}^h$.
To define the ghost penalty, let $\mathcal{T}_\Gamma^h$ be the set of intersected cells:
@f{equation*}{
  \mathcal{T}_{\Gamma}^h = \{ T \in \mathcal{T}_{\Omega}^{h} : T \cap \Gamma \neq \emptyset \},
@f}
and let $\mathcal{F}_h$ denote the interior faces of the intersected cells in the active mesh:
@f{equation*}{
  \mathcal{F}_h = \{ F = \overline{T}_+ \cap \overline{T}_- : \,
                     T_+ \in \mathcal{T}_{\Gamma}^h, \,
                     T_- \in \mathcal{T}_{\Omega}^h
                  \}.
@f}
@image html step-85-ghost-faces.svg
The ghost penalty acts on these faces and reads
@f{equation*}{
  g_h(u_h,v_h) = \gamma_A \sum_{F \in \mathcal{F}_h} g_F(u_h, v_h),
@f}
where $g_F$ is the face-wise ghost penalty:
@f{equation*}{
  g_F(u_h, v_h) = \gamma_A \sum_{k=0}^p \left(\frac{h_F^{2k-1}}{k!^2}[\partial_n^k u_h], [\partial_n^k v_h] \right)_F.
@f}
Here, $\gamma_A$ is a penalty parameter and $h_F$ is some measure of the face size.
We see that $g_F$ penalizes the jumps in the face-normal derivatives, $\partial_n^k$,
over $F = \overline{T}_+ \cap \overline{T}_-$.
Since we include all normal derivatives up to the polynomial degree,
we weakly force the piecewise polynomial to behave as a single polynomial over $\overline{T}_+ \cup \overline{T}_-$.
Hand-wavingly speaking,
this is the reason why we obtain a cut-independent method when we enforce $g_F(u_h, v_h) = 0$ over the faces in $\mathcal{F}_h$.

In case of a continuous space of $Q_1$-elements,
so the ghost penalty is reduced to
@f{equation*}{
  g_h(u_h,v_h) = \gamma_A \sum_{F \in \mathcal{F}_h} (h_F [\partial_n u_h], [\partial_n v_h])_F.
@f}
 
The actual assembly can be done using FEInterfaceValues:
@code
const QGauss<dim - 1>  face_quadrature(fe_degree + 1);
FEInterfaceValues<dim> fe_interface_values(fe_collection[0],
                                            face_quadrature,
                                            update_gradients |
                                              update_JxW_values |
                                              update_normal_vectors);
@endcode

 As we iterate over the local faces, we first check if the current face belongs to the set $\mathcal{F}_h$.
Assembling in this we will traverse each internal face in the mesh twice, so in order to get the penalty
constant we expect, we multiply the penalty term with a factor 1/2.

 @code
  for (const unsigned int f : cell->face_indices())
    if (face_has_ghost_penalty(cell, f))
      {
        const unsigned int invalid_subface =
          numbers::invalid_unsigned_int;

        fe_interface_values.reinit(cell,
                                    f,
                                    invalid_subface,
                                    cell->neighbor(f),
                                    cell->neighbor_of_neighbor(f),
                                    invalid_subface);

        const unsigned int n_interface_dofs =
          fe_interface_values.n_current_interface_dofs();
        FullMatrix<double> local_stabilization(n_interface_dofs,
                                                n_interface_dofs);
        for (unsigned int q = 0;
              q < fe_interface_values.n_quadrature_points;
              ++q)
          {
            const Tensor<1, dim> normal =
              fe_interface_values.normal_vector(q);
            for (unsigned int i = 0; i < n_interface_dofs; ++i)
              for (unsigned int j = 0; j < n_interface_dofs; ++j)
                {
                  local_stabilization(i, j) +=
                    .5 * ghost_parameter * cell_side_length * normal *
                    fe_interface_values.jump_in_shape_gradients(i, q) *
                    normal *
                    fe_interface_values.jump_in_shape_gradients(j, q) *
                    fe_interface_values.JxW(q);
                }
          }

        const std::vector<types::global_dof_index>
          local_interface_dof_indices =
            fe_interface_values.get_interface_dof_indices();

        stiffness_matrix.add(local_interface_dof_indices,
                              local_stabilization);
      }
@endcode

For higher order elements things get more complicated as the ghost penalty requires computing higher derivatives.
Although the implementation is more involved, deal.II provides the necessary functionality to compute up to third
order derivatives. Instead of implementing the integration of the penalty terms directly,
 we can exploit the fact that the mesh is Cartesian. On tensor product elements,
  the local ghost penalty can be computed as a Kronecker product of 1D matrices:
   $G \otimes M$ in 2D or $G \otimes M \otimes M$ in 3D, where $G$ is a 1D penalty matrix and $M$ is a 1D mass matrix.
This representation requires that the degrees of freedom on the patch of the two cells adjacent
to the face are ordered lexicographically.

<h3>Discrete Level Set Function</h3>
A typical use case of a level set method is a problem where the domain is advected in a velocity field,
such that the domain deforms with time.
For such a problem,
one would typically solve for an approximation of the level set function, $\psi_h \in V^h$,
in a separate finite element space over the whole background mesh:
@f{equation*}{
  V^h = \{ v \in C(\mathcal{N}^h) : v \in Q_p(T), \, T \in \mathcal{T}^h \},
@f}
where $\mathcal{N}^h = \bigcup_{T \in \mathcal{T}^h} \overline{T}$.
Even if we solve a much simpler problem with a stationary domain in this tutorial,
we shall, just to illustrate, still use a discrete level set function for the Poisson problem.
Technically,
this is a so-called "variational crime" because we are actually not using the bilinear form $a_h$ but instead
@f{equation*}{
  a_h^\star(u_h, v_h) = (\nabla u_h, \nabla v_h)_{\Omega_h}
                      - (\partial_n u_h, v_h)_{\Gamma_h} + \ldots
@f}
This is an approximation of $a_h$ since we integrate over the approximations of the geometry that we get via the discrete level set function:
@f{align*}{
  \Omega_h &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{dim}} : \psi_h(x) < 0 \}, \\
  \Gamma_h &= \{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{dim}} : \psi_h(x) = 0 \}.
@f}
Using $\Omega_h$ instead of $\Omega$ in the method will give rise to a larger error in the numerical solution.
This is often referred to as the "geometrical error".
However, when the same element order, $p$, is used in $V^h$ and $V_\Omega^h$,
one can often show that the method gives the same order of convergence
as if the exact domain would have been used.
Furthermore, deal.II allows us to independently choose a more accurate geometry representation
with a higher-order level set function, compared to the function space for solving the Poisson equation.

<h3>The MeshClassifier Class</h3>
Even if we have used $\mathcal{T}_\Omega^h$ to define the finite element space,
we will not create this submesh in practice. As in step-46, we shall
instead use the hp-framework. To create $V_\Omega^h$, we first add an FE_Q and an
FE_Nothing element to an hp::FECollection. We then iterate over each cell,
$T$, and depending on whether $T$ belongs to $\mathcal{T}_\Omega^h$ or not,
we set the active_fe_index to either 0 or 1. To do so, we need to
determine if a given cell is in $\mathcal{T}_\Omega^h$ or not.
For this purpose, we will use the class NonMatching::MeshClassifier.
The NonMatching::MeshClassifier takes the discrete level set function,
described as a (DoFHandler, Vector)-pair, as arguments to its constructor:
@code
  MeshClassifier(const DoFHandler<dim> &level_set_dof_handler,
                 const VectorType &     level_set);
@endcode
When we call the reclassify() function on an object of this class,
each active cell and face is associated with one of the values
{inside, outside, intersected} of the enum NonMatching::LocationToLevelSet.
Here, "inside" means that the level set function is negative over the whole cell
so that it lies completely inside the domain.
Analogously, "outside" means that $\psi$ is positive over the whole cell,
and "intersected" means that $\psi$ varies in sign over $T$
so that the zero-contour of $\psi$ goes through $T$.

| LocationToLevelSet | $\psi(x)$ for $x \in T$  | Relation to $\Omega$           |
|:------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| inside             | $\psi(x) < 0$            | $T \cap \Omega = T$            |
| outside            | $0 < \psi(x)$            | $T \cap \Omega = \emptyset$    |
| intersected        | $\psi(x)$ varies in sign | $T \cap \Gamma \neq \emptyset$ |

Each active face is classified in the same way, according to how the sign of $\psi$ varies over the face.
NonMatching::MeshClassifier lets you query this information for a given cell/face via its NonMatching::MeshClassifier::location_to_level_set() methods:
@code
  NonMatching::MeshClassifier<dim> mesh_classifier(dof_handler, level_set);
  mesh_classifier.reclassify();

  for (const auto &cell : triangulation.active_cell_iterators())
    {
      NonMatching::LocationToLevelSet cell_location =
        mesh_classifier.location_to_level_set(cell);

      for (const unsigned int f : cell->face_indices())
        {
          NonMatching::LocationToLevelSet face_location =
            mesh_classifier.location_to_level_set(cell, f);
        }
    }
@endcode
