<h1>Results</h1>

The directory in which this program is run does not contain a parameter file by
default. On the other hand, this program wants to read its parameters from a
file called parameters.prm -- and so, when you execute it the first time, you
will get an exception that no such file can be found:

@code
----------------------------------------------------
Exception on processing:

--------------------------------------------------------
An error occurred in line <74> of file <../source/base/parameter_acceptor.cc> in function
    static void dealii::ParameterAcceptor::initialize(const std::string &, const std::string &, const ParameterHandler::OutputStyle, dealii::ParameterHandler &)
The violated condition was:
    false
Additional information:
    You specified <parameters.prm> as input parameter file, but it does not exist. We created it for you.
--------------------------------------------------------

Aborting!
----------------------------------------------------
@endcode

However, as the error message already states, the code that triggers the
exception will also generate a parameters.prm file that simply contains the
default values for all parameters this program cares about. By inspection of the
parameter file, we see the following:

  end

@endcode

The rationale behind creating first `parameters.prm` file (the first time the
program is run) and then a `used_parameters.prm` (every other times you run the
program), is because you may want to leave most parameters to their default
values, and only modify a handful of them.

For example, you could use the following (perfectly valid) parameter file with
this tutorial program:
@code
subsection Distributed Lagrange<1,2>
  set Initial embedded space refinement            = 7
  set Initial embedding space refinement           = 4
  set Local refinements steps near embedded domain = 3
  subsection Embedded configuration
    set Function constants  = R=.3, Cx=.4, Cy=.4
    set Function expression = R*cos(2*pi*x)+Cx; R*sin(2*pi*x)+Cy
    set Variable names      = x,y,t
  end
  subsection Embedded value
    set Function constants  =
    set Function expression = 1
    set Variable names      = x,y,t
  end
end
@endcode

and you would obtain exactly the same results as in test case 1 below.

<h3> Test case 1: </h3>

For the default problem the value of $u$ on $\Gamma$ is set to the constant $1$:
this is like imposing a constant Dirichlet boundary condition on $\Gamma$, seen
as boundary of the portion of $\Omega$ inside $\Gamma$. Similarly on $\partial
\Omega$ we have zero Dirichlet boundary conditions.

You may notice that, in terms of CPU time, assembling the coupling system is
twice as expensive as assembling the standard Poisson system, even though the
matrix is smaller. This is due to the non-matching nature of the discretization.
Whether this is acceptable or not, depends on the applications.

If the problem was set in a three-dimensional setting, and the immersed mesh was
time dependent, it would be much more expensive to recreate the mesh at each
step rather than use the technique we present here. Moreover, you may be able to
create a very fast and optimized solver on a uniformly refined square or cubic
grid, and embed the domain where you want to perform your computation using the
technique presented here. This would require you to only have a surface
representatio of your domain (a much cheaper and easier mesh to produce).

To play around a little bit, we are going to complicate a little the fictitious
domain as well as the boundary conditions we impose on it.

<h3> Test case 2 and 3: </h3>

If we use the following parameter file:
@code
subsection Distributed Lagrange<1,2>
  set Coupling quadrature order                    = 3
  set Embedded configuration finite element degree = 1
  set Embedded space finite element degree         = 1
  set Embedding space finite element degree        = 1
  set Homogeneous Dirichlet boundary ids           = 0,1,2,3
  set Initial embedded space refinement            = 8
  set Initial embedding space refinement           = 4
  set Local refinements steps near embedded domain = 4
  set Use displacement in embedded interface       = false
  set Verbosity level                              = 10
  subsection Embedded configuration
    set Function constants  = R=.3, Cx=.5, Cy=.5, r=.1, w=12
    set Function expression = (R+r*cos(w*pi*x))*cos(2*pi*x)+Cx; (R+r*cos(w*pi*x))*sin(2*pi*x)+Cy
    set Variable names      = x,y,t
  end
  subsection Embedded value
    set Function constants  =
    set Function expression = x-.5
    set Variable names      = x,y,t
  end
  subsection Schur solver control
    set Log frequency = 1
    set Log history   = false
    set Log result    = true
    set Max steps     = 100000
    set Reduction     = 1.e-12
    set Tolerance     = 1.e-12
  end
end
@endcode

We get a "flowery" looking domain, where we impose a linear boundary condition
$g=x-.5$. This test shows that the method is actually quite accurate in
recovering an exactly linear function from its boundary conditions, and even
though the meshes are not aligned, we obtain a pretty good result.

Replacing $x-.5$ with $2(x-.5)^2-2(y-.5)^2$, i.e., modifying the parameter file
such that we have
@code
  ...
  subsection Embedded value
    set Function constants  =
    set Function expression = 2*(x-.5)^2-2*(y-.5)^2
    set Variable names      = x,y,t
  end
@endcode
produces the saddle on the right.

<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

<h4> Running with `spacedim` equal to three</h4>

While the current tutorial program is written for `spacedim` equal to two, there
are only minor changes you have to do in order for the program to run in
different combinations of dimensions.

If you want to run with `spacedim` equal to three and `dim` equal to two, then
you will almost certainly want to perform the following changes:

- use a different reference domain for the embedded grid, maybe reading it from
  a file. It is not possible to construct a smooth closed surface with one
  single parametrization of a square domain, therefore you'll most likely want
  to use a reference domain that is topologically equivalent to a the boundary
  of a sphere.

- use a displacement instead of the deformation to map $\Gamma_0$ into $\Gamma$

<h4> More general domains </h4>

We have seen in other tutorials (for example in step-5 and step-54) how to read
grids from input files. A nice generalization for this tutorial program would be
to allow the user to select a grid to read from the parameter file itself,
instead of hardcoding the mesh type in the tutorial program itself.

<h4> Preconditioner</h4>

At the moment, we have no preconditioner on the Schur complement. This is ok for
two dimensional problems, where a few hundred iterations bring the residual down
to the machine precision, but it's not going to work in three dimensions.

It is not obvious what a good preconditioner would be here. The physical problem
we are solving with the Schur complement, is to associate to the Dirichlet data
$g$, the value of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$. $\lambda$ can be
interpreted as the *jump* in the normal gradient that needs to be imposed on $u$
across $\Gamma$, in order to obtain the Dirichlet data $g$.

So $S$ is some sort of Neumann to Dirichlet map, and we would like to have a
good approximation for the Dirichlet to Neumann map. A possibility would be to
use a Boundary Element approximation of the problem on $\Gamma$, and construct a
rough approximation of the hyper-singular operator for the Poisson problem
associated to $\Gamma$, which is precisely a Dirichlet to Neumann map.

<h4> Parallel Code </h4>

The simple code proposed here can serve as a starting point for more
complex problems which, to be solved, need to be run on parallel
code, possibly using distributed meshes (see step-17, step-40, and the
documentation for parallel::shared::Triangulation and
parallel::distributed::Triangulation).

When using non-matching grids in parallel a problem arises: to compute the
matrix $C$ a process needs information about both meshes on the same portion of
real space but, when working with distributed meshes, this information may not
be available, because the locally owned part of the $\Omega$ triangulation
stored on a given processor may not be physically co-located with the locally
owned part of the $\Gamma$ triangulation stored on the same processor.

Various strategies can be implemented to tackle this problem:

- distribute the two meshes so that this constraint is satisfied;

- use communication for the parts of real space where the constraint is not
  satisfied;

- use a distributed triangulation for the embedding space, and a shared
  triangulation for the emdedded configuration.

The latter strategy is clearly the easiest to implement, as most of the
functions used in this tutorial program will work unchanged also in the parallel
case. Of course one could use the reversal strategy (that is, have a distributed
embedded Triangulation and a shared embedding Triangulation).

However, this strategy is most likely going to be more expensive, since by
definition the embedding grid is larger than the embedded grid, and it makes
more sense to distribute the largest of the two grids, maintaining the smallest
one shared among all processors.
