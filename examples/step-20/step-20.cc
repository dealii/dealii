// @sect3{Include files}

// Since this program is only an adaptation of step-4, there is not much new
// stuff in terms of header files. In deal.II, we usually list include files
// in the order base-lac-grid-dofs-fe-numerics, followed by C++ standard
// include files:
#include <deal.II/base/quadrature_lib.h>
#include <deal.II/base/logstream.h>
#include <deal.II/base/function.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/block_vector.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/full_matrix.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/block_sparse_matrix.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/solver_cg.h>
#include <deal.II/lac/precondition.h>
// For our Schur complement solver, we need two new objects. One is a matrix
// object which acts as the inverse of a matrix by calling an iterative
// solver.
#include <deal.II/lac/iterative_inverse.h>

#include <deal.II/grid/tria.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/grid_generator.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/tria_accessor.h>
#include <deal.II/grid/tria_iterator.h>
#include <deal.II/dofs/dof_handler.h>

#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

// This is the only significant new header, namely the one in which the
// Raviart-Thomas finite element is declared:
#include <deal.II/fe/fe_raviart_thomas.h>

// Finally, as a bonus in this program, we will use a tensorial
// coefficient. Since it may have a spatial dependence, we consider it a
// tensor-valued function. The following include file provides the
// <code>TensorFunction</code> class that offers such functionality:
#include <deal.II/base/tensor_function.h>

// The last step is as in all previous programs:

  // @sect3{The <code>MixedLaplaceProblem</code> class template}

  // Again, since this is an adaptation of step-6, the main class is almost
  // the same as the one in that tutorial program. In terms of member
  // functions, the main differences are that the constructor takes the degree
  // of the Raviart-Thomas element as an argument (and that there is a
  // corresponding member variable to store this value) and the addition of
  // the <code>compute_error</code> function in which, no surprise, we will
  // compute the difference between the exact and the numerical solution to
  // determine convergence of our computations:

  // later computations of the error. Note that these functions have one, one,
  // and <code>dim+1</code> components, respectively, and that we pass the
  // number of components down to the <code>Function@<dim@></code> base
  // class. For the exact solution, we only declare the function that actually
  // returns the entire solution vector (i.e. all components of it) at
  // once. Here are the respective declarations:

  // @sect3{The inverse permeability tensor}

  // In addition to the other equation data, we also want to use a
  // permeability tensor, or better -- because this is all that appears in the
  // weak form -- the inverse of the permeability tensor,
  // <code>KInverse</code>. For the purpose of verifying the exactness of the
  // solution and determining convergence orders, this tensor is more in the
  // way than helpful. We will therefore simply set it to the identity matrix.
  //
  // However, a spatially varying permeability tensor is indispensable in
  // real-life porous media flow simulations, and we would like to use the
  // opportunity to demonstrate the technique to use tensor valued functions.
  //
  // Possibly unsurprising, deal.II also has a base class not only for scalar
  // and generally vector-valued functions (the <code>Function</code> base
  // class) but also for functions that return tensors of fixed dimension and
  // rank, the <code>TensorFunction</code> template. Here, the function under
  // consideration returns a dim-by-dim matrix, i.e. a tensor of rank 2 and
  // dimension <code>dim</code>. We then choose the template arguments of the
  // base class appropriately.
  //
  // The interface that the <code>TensorFunction</code> class provides is
  // essentially equivalent to the <code>Function</code> class. In particular,
  // there exists a <code>value_list</code> function that takes a list of
  // points at which to evaluate the function, and returns the values of the
  // function in the second argument, a list of tensors:

  };


  // The implementation is less interesting. As in previous examples, we add a
  // check to the beginning of the class to make sure that the sizes of input
  // and output parameters are the same (see step-5 for a discussion of this
  // technique). Then we loop over all evaluation points, and for each one
  // first clear the output tensor and then set all its diagonal elements to
  // one (i.e. fill the tensor with the identity matrix):
  template <int dim>

  // In the constructor of this class, we first store the value that was
  // passed in concerning the degree of the finite elements we shall use (a
  // degree of zero, for example, means to use RT(0) and DG(0)), and then
  // construct the vector valued element belonging to the space $X_h$ described
  // in the introduction. The rest of the constructor is as in the early
  // tutorial programs.
  //
  // The only thing worth describing here is the constructor call of the
  // <code>fe</code> variable. The <code>FESystem</code> class to which this
  // variable belongs has a number of different constructors that all refer to
  // binding simpler elements together into one larger element. In the present
  // case, we want to couple a single RT(degree) element with a single
  // DQ(degree) element. The constructor to <code>FESystem</code> that does
  // this requires us to specify first the first base element (the
  // <code>FE_RaviartThomas</code> object of given degree) and then the number
  // of copies for this base element, and then similarly the kind and number
  // of <code>FE_DGQ</code> elements. Note that the Raviart-Thomas element
  // already has <code>dim</code> vector components, so that the coupled
  // element will have <code>dim+1</code> vector components, the first
  // <code>dim</code> of which correspond to the velocity variable whereas the
  // last one corresponds to the pressure.
  //
  // It is also worth comparing the way we constructed this element from its
  // base elements, with the way we have done so in step-8: there, we have
  // built it as <code>fe (FE_Q@<dim@>(1), dim)</code>, i.e. we have simply
  // used <code>dim</code> copies of the <code>FE_Q(1)</code> element, one
  // copy for the displacement in each coordinate direction.

    // However, then things become different. As mentioned in the
    // introduction, we want to subdivide the matrix into blocks corresponding
    // to the two different kinds of variables, velocity and pressure. To this
    // end, we first have to make sure that the indices corresponding to
    // velocities and pressures are not intermingled: First all velocity
    // degrees of freedom, then all pressure DoFs. This way, the global matrix
    // separates nicely into a $2 \times 2$ system. To achieve this, we have to
    // renumber degrees of freedom base on their vector component, an
    // operation that conveniently is already implemented:
    DoFRenumbering::component_wise (dof_handler);

    // The next thing is that we want to figure out the sizes of these blocks,

    // counts how many shape functions are non-zero for a particular vector
    // component. We have <code>dim+1</code> vector components, and we have to
    // use the knowledge that for Raviart-Thomas elements all shape functions
    // are nonzero in all components. In other words, the number of velocity
    // shape functions equals the number of overall shape functions that are
    // nonzero in the zeroth vector component. On the other hand, the number
    // of pressure variables equals the number of shape functions that are
    // nonzero in the dim-th component. Let us compute these numbers and then

    // to its correct size using the <code>n_u</code> and <code>n_p</code>
    // variables defined above that hold the number of velocity and pressure
    // variables. In this second step, we only operate on the individual
    // blocks of the system. In the third step, we therefore have to instruct

  // @sect4{The <code>SchurComplement</code> class template}

  // The next class is the Schur complement class. Its rationale has also been
  // discussed in length in the introduction. The only things we would like to
  // note is that the class, too, is derived from the <code>Subscriptor</code>
  // class and that as mentioned above it stores pointers to the entire block
  // matrix and the inverse of the mass matrix block using
  // <code>SmartPointer</code> objects.
  //
  // The <code>vmult</code> function requires two temporary vectors that we do
  // not want to re-allocate and free every time we call this function. Since
  // here, we have full control over the use of these vectors (unlike above,
  // where a class called by the <code>vmult</code> function required these
  // vectors, not the <code>vmult</code> function itself), we allocate them
  // directly, rather than going through the <code>VectorMemory</code>
  // mechanism. However, again, these member variables do not carry any state
  // between successive calls to the member functions of this class (i.e., we
  // never care what values they were set to the last time a member function
  // was called), we mark these vectors as <code>mutable</code>.
  //
  // The rest of the (short) implementation of this class is straightforward
  // if you know the order of matrix-vector multiplications performed by the
  // <code>vmult</code> function:

  // the same pattern as the Schur complement class, with the only exception
  // that we do not multiply with the inverse mass matrix in
  // <code>vmult</code>, but rather just do a single Jacobi
  // step. Consequently, the class also does not have to store a pointer to an
  // inverse mass matrix object.
  //
  // We will later use this class as a template argument to the
  // IterativeInverse class which will in turn want to use it as a
  // template argument for the PointerMatrix class. The latter class
  // has a function that requires us to also write a function that
  // provides the product with the transpose of the matrix this object
  // represents. As a consequence, in the code below, we also
  // implement a <tt>Tvmult</tt> function here that represents the
  // product of the transpose matrix with a vector. It is easy to see
  // how this needs to be implemented here: since the matrix is
  // symmetric, we can as well call <code>vmult</code> wherever the
  // product with the transpose matrix is required. (Note, however,
  // that even though we implement this function here, there will in
  // fact not be any need for it as long as we use SolverCG as the

  // @sect4{MixedLaplace::compute_errors}

  // After we have dealt with the linear solver and preconditioners, we
  // continue with the implementation of our main class. In particular, the
  // next task is to compute the errors in our numerical solution, in both the
  // pressures as well as velocities.
  //
  // To compute errors in the solution, we have already introduced the
  // <code>VectorTools::integrate_difference</code> function in step-7 and
  // step-11. However, there we only dealt with scalar solutions, whereas here
  // we have a vector-valued solution with components that even denote
  // different quantities and may have different orders of convergence (this
  // isn't the case here, by choice of the used finite elements, but is
  // frequently the case in mixed finite element applications). What we
  // therefore have to do is to `mask' the components that we are interested
  // in. This is easily done: the
  // <code>VectorTools::integrate_difference</code> function takes as its last
  // argument a pointer to a weight function (the parameter defaults to the
  // null pointer, meaning unit weights). What we simply have to do is to pass
  // a function object that equals one in the components we are interested in,
  // and zero in the other ones. For example, to compute the pressure error,
  // we should pass a function that represents the constant vector with a unit
  // value in component <code>dim</code>, whereas for the velocity the
  // constant vector should be one in the first <code>dim</code> components,
  // and zero in the location of the pressure.
  //
  // In deal.II, the <code>ComponentSelectFunction</code> does exactly this:
  // it wants to know how many vector components the function it is to
  // represent should have (in our case this would be <code>dim+1</code>, for
  // the joint velocity-pressure space) and which individual or range of
  // components should be equal to one. We therefore define two such masks at
  // the beginning of the function, following by an object representing the
  // exact solution and a vector in which we will store the cellwise errors as
  // computed by <code>integrate_difference</code>:
  template <int dim>
  void MixedLaplaceProblem<dim>::compute_errors () const
  {
    const ComponentSelectFunction<dim>
    pressure_mask (dim, dim+1);

    velocity_mask(std::make_pair(0, dim), dim+1);

    ExactSolution<dim> exact_solution;
    Vector<double> cellwise_errors (triangulation.n_active_cells());

    // As already discussed in step-7, we have to realize that it is
    // impossible to integrate the errors exactly. All we can do is
    // approximate this integral using quadrature. This actually presents a
    // slight twist here: if we naively chose an object of type
    // <code>QGauss@<dim@>(degree+1)</code> as one may be inclined to do (this
    // is what we used for integrating the linear system), one realizes that
    // the error is very small and does not follow the expected convergence
    // curves at all. What is happening is that for the mixed finite elements
    // used here, the Gauss points happen to be superconvergence points in
    // which the pointwise error is much smaller (and converges with higher
    // order) than anywhere else. These are therefore not particularly good
    // points for integration. To avoid this problem, we simply use a
    // trapezoidal rule and iterate it <code>degree+2</code> times in each
    // coordinate direction (again as explained in step-7):
