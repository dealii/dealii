// @sect3{Right hand side and boundary values}

// In the following, we declare two more classes denoting the right hand side
// and the non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary values. Both are functions of a
// dim-dimensional space variable, so we declare them as templates as well.
//
// Each of these classes is derived from a common, abstract base class
// Function, which declares the common interface which all functions have to
// follow. In particular, concrete classes have to overload the
// <code>value</code> function, which takes a point in dim-dimensional space
// as parameters and returns the value at that point as a
// <code>double</code> variable.
//
// The <code>value</code> function takes a second argument, which we have here
// named <code>component</code>: This is only meant for vector-valued
// functions, where you may want to access a certain component of the vector
// at the point <code>p</code>. However, our functions are scalar, so we need
// not worry about this parameter and we will not use it in the implementation
// of the functions. Inside the library's header files, the Function base
// class's declaration of the <code>value</code> function has a default value
// of zero for the component, so we will access the <code>value</code>
// function of the right hand side with only one parameter, namely the point
// where we want to evaluate the function. A value for the component can then
// simply be omitted for scalar functions.
//
// Function objects are used in lots of places in the library (for example, in
// step-3 we used a Functions::ZeroFunction instance as an argument to
// VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values) and this is the first tutorial
// where we define a new class that inherits from Function. Since we only ever
// call Function::value(), we could get away with just a plain function (and
// this is what is done in step-5), but since this is a tutorial we inherit from
// Function for the sake of example.

};

// If you are not familiar with what the keywords `virtual` and `override` in
// the function declarations above mean, you will probably want to take a look
// at your favorite C++ book or an online tutorial such as
// http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/polymorphism/ . In essence, what is
// happening here is that Function<dim> is an "abstract" base class that
// declares a certain "interface" -- a set of functions one can call on
// objects of this kind. But it does not actually *implement* these functions:
// it just says "this is how Function objects look like", but what kind of
// function it actually is, is left to derived classes that implement
// the `value()` function.
//
// Deriving one class from another is often called an "is-a" relationship
// function. Here, the `RightHandSide` class "is a" Function class
// because it implements the interface described by the Function base class.
// (The actual implementation of the `value()` function is in the code block
// below.) The `virtual` keyword then means "Yes, the
// function here is one that can be overridden by derived classes",
// and the `override` keyword means "Yes, this is in fact a function we know
// has been declared as part of the base class". The `override` keyword is not
// strictly necessary, but is an insurance against typos: If we get the name
// of the function or the type of one argument wrong, the compiler will warn
// us by stating "You say that this function overrides one in a base class,
// but I don't actually know any such function with this name and these
// arguments."
//
// But back to the concrete case here:
// For this tutorial, we choose as right hand side the function
// $4(x^4+y^4)$ in 2D, or $4(x^4+y^4+z^4)$ in 3D. We could write this
// distinction using an if-statement on the space dimension, but here is a
// simple way that also allows us to use the same function in 1D (or in 4D, if
// you should desire to do so), by using a short loop.  Fortunately, the
// compiler knows the size of the loop at compile time (remember that at the
// time when you define the template, the compiler doesn't know the value of
// <code>dim</code>, but when it later encounters a statement or declaration
// <code>RightHandSide@<2@></code>, it will take the template, replace all
// occurrences of dim by 2 and compile the resulting function).  In other
// words, at the time of compiling this function, the number of times the body
// will be executed is known, and the compiler can minimize the overhead
// needed for the loop; the result will be as fast as if we had used the
// formulas above right away.
//
// The last thing to note is that a <code>Point@<dim@></code> denotes a point
// in dim-dimensional space, and its individual components (i.e. $x$, $y$,
// ... coordinates) can be accessed using the () operator (in fact, the []
// operator will work just as well) with indices starting at zero as usual in
// C and C++.
template <int dim>
double RightHandSide<dim>::value(const Point<dim> &p,
                                 const unsigned int /*component*/) const
{
  double return_value = 0.0;
  for (unsigned int i = 0; i < dim; ++i)
    return_value += 4.0 * std::pow(p(i), 4.0);

  return return_value;
}


// As boundary values, we choose $x^2+y^2$ in 2D, and $x^2+y^2+z^2$ in 3D. This
// happens to be equal to the square of the vector from the origin to the
// point at which we would like to evaluate the function, irrespective of the
// dimension. So that is what we return:
template <int dim>
double BoundaryValues<dim>::value(const Point<dim> &p,
                                  const unsigned int /*component*/) const
{
  return p.square();
}



// @sect3{Implementation of the <code>Step4</code> class}

// Next for the implementation of the class template that makes use of the
// functions above. As before, we will write everything as templates that have
// a formal parameter <code>dim</code> that we assume unknown at the time we
// define the template functions. Only later, the compiler will find a
// declaration of <code>Step4@<2@></code> (in the <code>main</code> function,
// actually) and compile the entire class with <code>dim</code> replaced by 2,
// a process referred to as `instantiation of a template'. When doing so, it
// will also replace instances of <code>RightHandSide@<dim@></code> by
// <code>RightHandSide@<2@></code> and instantiate the latter class from the
// class template.
//
// In fact, the compiler will also find a declaration <code>Step4@<3@></code>
// in <code>main()</code>. This will cause it to again go back to the general
// <code>Step4@<dim@></code> template, replace all occurrences of
// <code>dim</code>, this time by 3, and compile the class a second time. Note
// that the two instantiations <code>Step4@<2@></code> and
// <code>Step4@<3@></code> are completely independent classes; their only
// common feature is that they are both instantiated from the same general
// template, but they are not convertible into each other, for example, and
// share no code (both instantiations are compiled completely independently).


// @sect4{Step4::Step4}

// After this introduction, here is the constructor of the <code>Step4</code>
// class. It specifies the desired polynomial degree of the finite elements
// and associates the DoFHandler to the triangulation just as in the previous
// example program, step-3:
template <int dim>
Step4<dim>::Step4()
  : fe(1)
  , dof_handler(triangulation)
{}


// @sect4{Step4::make_grid}

// Grid creation is something inherently dimension dependent. However, as long
// as the domains are sufficiently similar in 2D or 3D, the library can
// abstract for you. In our case, we would like to again solve on the square
// $[-1,1]\times [-1,1]$ in 2D, or on the cube $[-1,1] \times [-1,1] \times
// [-1,1]$ in 3D; both can be termed GridGenerator::hyper_cube(), so we may
// use the same function in whatever dimension we are. Of course, the
// functions that create a hypercube in two and three dimensions are very much
// different, but that is something you need not care about. Let the library
// handle the difficult things.

            << std::endl;
}

// @sect4{Step4::setup_system}

// This function looks exactly like in the previous example, although it
// performs actions that in their details are quite different if
// <code>dim</code> happens to be 3. The only significant difference from a
// user's perspective is the number of cells resulting, which is much higher
// in three than in two space dimensions!

// @sect4{Step4::assemble_system}

// Unlike in the previous example, we would now like to use a non-constant
// right hand side function and non-zero boundary values. Both are tasks that
// are readily achieved with only a few new lines of code in the assemblage of
// the matrix and right hand side.
//
// More interesting, though, is the way we assemble matrix and right hand side
// vector dimension independently: there is simply no difference to the
// two-dimensional case. Since the important objects used in this function
// (quadrature formula, FEValues) depend on the dimension by way of a template
// parameter as well, they can take care of setting up properly everything for
// the dimension for which this function is compiled. By declaring all classes
// which might depend on the dimension using a template parameter, the library
// can make nearly all work for you and you don't have to care about most
// things.
template <int dim>
void Step4<dim>::assemble_system()
{

  // We wanted to have a non-constant right hand side, so we use an object of
  // the class declared above to generate the necessary data. Since this right
  // hand side object is only used locally in the present function, we declare
  // it here as a local variable:
  RightHandSide<dim> right_hand_side;

  // Compared to the previous example, in order to evaluate the non-constant
  // right hand side function we now also need the quadrature points on the
  // cell we are presently on (previously, we only required values and
  // gradients of the shape function from the FEValues object, as well as the
  // quadrature weights, FEValues::JxW() ). We can tell the FEValues object to
  // do for us by also giving it the #update_quadrature_points flag:
  FEValues<dim> fe_values(fe,
                          quadrature_formula,
                          update_values | update_gradients |
                            update_quadrature_points | update_JxW_values);

  // We then again define the same abbreviation as in the previous program.
  // The value of this variable of course depends on the dimension which we
  // are presently using, but the FiniteElement class does all the necessary
  // work for you and you don't have to care about the dimension dependent
  // parts:
  const unsigned int dofs_per_cell = fe.dofs_per_cell;

  FullMatrix<double> cell_matrix(dofs_per_cell, dofs_per_cell);
  Vector<double>     cell_rhs(dofs_per_cell);

  std::vector<types::global_dof_index> local_dof_indices(dofs_per_cell);

  // Next, we again have to loop over all cells and assemble local
  // contributions.  Note, that a cell is a quadrilateral in two space
  // dimensions, but a hexahedron in 3D. In fact, the
  // <code>active_cell_iterator</code> data type is something different,
  // depending on the dimension we are in, but to the outside world they look
  // alike and you will probably never see a difference. In any case, the real
  // type is hidden by using `auto`:
  for (const auto &cell : dof_handler.active_cell_iterators())
    {
      fe_values.reinit(cell);
      cell_matrix = 0;
      cell_rhs    = 0;

      // Now we have to assemble the local matrix and right hand side. This is
      // done exactly like in the previous example, but now we revert the
      // order of the loops (which we can safely do since they are independent
      // of each other) and merge the loops for the local matrix and the local
      // vector as far as possible to make things a bit faster.
      //
      // Assembling the right hand side presents the only significant
      // difference to how we did things in step-3: Instead of using a
      // constant right hand side with value 1, we use the object representing
      // the right hand side and evaluate it at the quadrature points:
      for (const unsigned int q_index : fe_values.quadrature_point_indices())
        for (const unsigned int i : fe_values.dof_indices())
          {
            for (const unsigned int j : fe_values.dof_indices())
              cell_matrix(i, j) +=
                (fe_values.shape_grad(i, q_index) * // grad phi_i(x_q)
                 fe_values.shape_grad(j, q_index) * // grad phi_j(x_q)
                 fe_values.JxW(q_index));           // dx

            const auto x_q = fe_values.quadrature_point(q_index);
            cell_rhs(i) += (fe_values.shape_value(i, q_index) * // phi_i(x_q)
                            right_hand_side.value(x_q) *        // f(x_q)
                            fe_values.JxW(q_index));            // dx
          }
      // As a final remark to these loops: when we assemble the local
      // contributions into <code>cell_matrix(i,j)</code>, we have to multiply
      // the gradients of shape functions $i$ and $j$ at point number
      // q_index and
      // multiply it with the scalar weights JxW. This is what actually
      // happens: <code>fe_values.shape_grad(i,q_index)</code> returns a
      // <code>dim</code> dimensional vector, represented by a
      // <code>Tensor@<1,dim@></code> object, and the operator* that
      // multiplies it with the result of
      // <code>fe_values.shape_grad(j,q_index)</code> makes sure that the
      // <code>dim</code> components of the two vectors are properly
      // contracted, and the result is a scalar floating point number that
      // then is multiplied with the weights. Internally, this operator* makes
      // sure that this happens correctly for all <code>dim</code> components
      // of the vectors, whether <code>dim</code> be 2, 3, or any other space
      // dimension; from a user's perspective, this is not something worth
      // bothering with, however, making things a lot simpler if one wants to
      // write code dimension independently.

      // With the local systems assembled, the transfer into the global matrix
      // and right hand side is done exactly as before, but here we have again
      // merged some loops for efficiency:
      cell->get_dof_indices(local_dof_indices);
