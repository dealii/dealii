// @sect3{Right hand side and boundary values}

// In the following, we declare two more classes denoting the right hand side
// and the non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary values. Both are functions of a
// dim-dimensional space variable, so we declare them as templates as well.
//
// Each of these classes is derived from a common, abstract base class
// Function, which declares the common interface which all functions have to
// follow. In particular, concrete classes have to overload the
// <code>value</code> function, which takes a point in dim-dimensional space
// as parameters and shall return the value at that point as a
// <code>double</code> variable.
//
// The <code>value</code> function takes a second argument, which we have here
// named <code>component</code>: This is only meant for vector valued
// functions, where you may want to access a certain component of the vector
// at the point <code>p</code>. However, our functions are scalar, so we need
// not worry about this parameter and we will not use it in the implementation
// of the functions. Inside the library's header files, the Function base
// class's declaration of the <code>value</code> function has a default value
// of zero for the component, so we will access the <code>value</code>
// function of the right hand side with only one parameter, namely the point
// where we want to evaluate the function. A value for the component can then
// simply be omitted for scalar functions.
//
// Note that the C++ language forces us to declare and define a constructor to
// the following classes even though they are empty. This is due to the fact
// that the base class has no default constructor (i.e. one without
// arguments), even though it has a constructor which has default values for
// all arguments.
template <int dim>
class RightHandSide : public Function<dim>
{

  RightHandSide () : Function<dim>() {}

  virtual double value (const Point<dim>   &p,
                        const unsigned int  component = 0) const;
};




// For this example, we choose as right hand side function to function
// $4(x^4+y^4)$ in 2D, or $4(x^4+y^4+z^4)$ in 3D. We could write this
// distinction using an if-statement on the space dimension, but here is a
// simple way that also allows us to use the same function in 1D (or in 4D, if
// you should desire to do so), by using a short loop.  Fortunately, the
// compiler knows the size of the loop at compile time (remember that at the
// time when you define the template, the compiler doesn't know the value of
// <code>dim</code>, but when it later encounters a statement or declaration
// <code>RightHandSide@<2@></code>, it will take the template, replace all
// occurrences of dim by 2 and compile the resulting function); in other
// words, at the time of compiling this function, the number of times the body
// will be executed is known, and the compiler can optimize away the overhead
// needed for the loop and the result will be as fast as if we had used the
// formulas above right away.
//
// The last thing to note is that a <code>Point@<dim@></code> denotes a point
// in dim-dimensional space, and its individual components (i.e. $x$, $y$,
// ... coordinates) can be accessed using the () operator (in fact, the []
// operator will work just as well) with indices starting at zero as usual in
// C and C++.
template <int dim>

// As boundary values, we choose x*x+y*y in 2D, and x*x+y*y+z*z in 3D. This
// happens to be equal to the square of the vector from the origin to the
// point at which we would like to evaluate the function, irrespective of the

// @sect3{Implementation of the <code>Step4</code> class}

// Next for the implementation of the class template that makes use of the
// functions above. As before, we will write everything as templates that have
// a formal parameter <code>dim</code> that we assume unknown at the time we
// define the template functions. Only later, the compiler will find a
// declaration of <code>Step4@<2@></code> (in the <code>main</code> function,
// actually) and compile the entire class with <code>dim</code> replaced by 2,
// a process referred to as `instantiation of a template'. When doing so, it
// will also replace instances of <code>RightHandSide@<dim@></code> by
// <code>RightHandSide@<2@></code> and instantiate the latter class from the
// class template.
//
// In fact, the compiler will also find a declaration <code>Step4@<3@></code>
// in <code>main()</code>. This will cause it to again go back to the general
// <code>Step4@<dim@></code> template, replace all occurrences of
// <code>dim</code>, this time by 3, and compile the class a second time. Note
// that the two instantiations <code>Step4@<2@></code> and
// <code>Step4@<3@></code> are completely independent classes; their only
// common feature is that they are both instantiated from the same general
// template, but they are not convertible into each other, for example, and
// share no code (both instantiations are compiled completely independently).


// @sect4{Step4::Step4}

// After this introduction, here is the constructor of the <code>Step4</code>
// class. It specifies the desired polynomial degree of the finite elements
// and associates the DoFHandler to the triangulation just as in the previous
// example program, step-3:
template <int dim>

// @sect4{Step4::make_grid}

// Grid creation is something inherently dimension dependent. However, as long
// as the domains are sufficiently similar in 2D or 3D, the library can
// abstract for you. In our case, we would like to again solve on the square
// $[-1,1]\times [-1,1]$ in 2D, or on the cube $[-1,1] \times [-1,1] \times
// [-1,1]$ in 3D; both can be termed GridGenerator::hyper_cube(), so we may
// use the same function in whatever dimension we are. Of course, the
// functions that create a hypercube in two and three dimensions are very much
// different, but that is something you need not care about. Let the library
// handle the difficult things.

// @sect4{Step4::setup_system}

// This function looks exactly like in the previous example, although it
// performs actions that in their details are quite different if
// <code>dim</code> happens to be 3. The only significant difference from a
// user's perspective is the number of cells resulting, which is much higher
// in three than in two space dimensions!

// @sect4{Step4::assemble_system}

// Unlike in the previous example, we would now like to use a non-constant
// right hand side function and non-zero boundary values. Both are tasks that
// are readily achieved with only a few new lines of code in the assemblage of
// the matrix and right hand side.
//
// More interesting, though, is the way we assemble matrix and right hand side
// vector dimension independently: there is simply no difference to the
// two-dimensional case. Since the important objects used in this function
// (quadrature formula, FEValues) depend on the dimension by way of a template
// parameter as well, they can take care of setting up properly everything for
// the dimension for which this function is compiled. By declaring all classes
// which might depend on the dimension using a template parameter, the library
// can make nearly all work for you and you don't have to care about most
// things.
template <int dim>
void Step4<dim>::assemble_system ()
{
  QGauss<dim>  quadrature_formula(2);

  // We wanted to have a non-constant right hand side, so we use an object of
  // the class declared above to generate the necessary data. Since this right
  // hand side object is only used locally in the present function, we declare
  // it here as a local variable:
  const RightHandSide<dim> right_hand_side;

  // Compared to the previous example, in order to evaluate the non-constant
  // right hand side function we now also need the quadrature points on the
  // cell we are presently on (previously, we only required values and
  // gradients of the shape function from the FEValues object, as well as the
  // quadrature weights, FEValues::JxW() ). We can tell the FEValues object to
  // do for us by also giving it the #update_quadrature_points flag:
  FEValues<dim> fe_values (fe, quadrature_formula,
                           update_values   | update_gradients |
                           update_quadrature_points | update_JxW_values);

  // We then again define a few abbreviations. The values of these variables
  // of course depend on the dimension which we are presently using. However,
  // the FE and Quadrature classes do all the necessary work for you and you
  // don't have to care about the dimension dependent parts:
  const unsigned int   dofs_per_cell = fe.dofs_per_cell;
  const unsigned int   n_q_points    = quadrature_formula.size();

  FullMatrix<double>   cell_matrix (dofs_per_cell, dofs_per_cell);
  Vector<double>       cell_rhs (dofs_per_cell);

  std::vector<types::global_dof_index> local_dof_indices (dofs_per_cell);

  // Next, we again have to loop over all cells and assemble local
  // contributions.  Note, that a cell is a quadrilateral in two space
  // dimensions, but a hexahedron in 3D. In fact, the
  // <code>active_cell_iterator</code> data type is something different,
  // depending on the dimension we are in, but to the outside world they look
  // alike and you will probably never see a difference although the classes
  // that this typedef stands for are in fact completely unrelated:
  typename DoFHandler<dim>::active_cell_iterator
  cell = dof_handler.begin_active(),
  endc = dof_handler.end();

  for (; cell!=endc; ++cell)
    {
      fe_values.reinit (cell);
      cell_matrix = 0;
      cell_rhs = 0;

      // Now we have to assemble the local matrix and right hand side. This is
      // done exactly like in the previous example, but now we revert the
      // order of the loops (which we can safely do since they are independent
      // of each other) and merge the loops for the local matrix and the local
      // vector as far as possible to make things a bit faster.
      //
      // Assembling the right hand side presents the only significant
      // difference to how we did things in step-3: Instead of using a
      // constant right hand side with value 1, we use the object representing
      // the right hand side and evaluate it at the quadrature points:
      for (unsigned int q_index=0; q_index<n_q_points; ++q_index)
        for (unsigned int i=0; i<dofs_per_cell; ++i)
          {

                                   fe_values.JxW (q_index));

                            fe_values.JxW (q_index));
          }
      // As a final remark to these loops: when we assemble the local
      // contributions into <code>cell_matrix(i,j)</code>, we have to multiply
      // the gradients of shape functions $i$ and $j$ at point number
      // q_index and
      // multiply it with the scalar weights JxW. This is what actually
      // happens: <code>fe_values.shape_grad(i,q_index)</code> returns a
      // <code>dim</code> dimensional vector, represented by a
      // <code>Tensor@<1,dim@></code> object, and the operator* that
      // multiplies it with the result of
      // <code>fe_values.shape_grad(j,q_index)</code> makes sure that the
      // <code>dim</code> components of the two vectors are properly
      // contracted, and the result is a scalar floating point number that
      // then is multiplied with the weights. Internally, this operator* makes
      // sure that this happens correctly for all <code>dim</code> components
      // of the vectors, whether <code>dim</code> be 2, 3, or any other space
      // dimension; from a user's perspective, this is not something worth
      // bothering with, however, making things a lot simpler if one wants to
      // write code dimension independently.

      // With the local systems assembled, the transfer into the global matrix
      // and right hand side is done exactly as before, but here we have again
      // merged some loops for efficiency:
      cell->get_dof_indices (local_dof_indices);

// @sect3{The <code>main</code> function}

// And this is the main function. It also looks mostly like in step-3, but if
// you look at the code below, note how we first create a variable of type
// <code>Step4@<2@></code> (forcing the compiler to compile the class template
// with <code>dim</code> replaced by <code>2</code>) and run a 2d simulation,
// and then we do the whole thing over in 3d.
//
// In practice, this is probably not what you would do very frequently (you
// probably either want to solve a 2d problem, or one in 3d, but not both at
// the same time). However, it demonstrates the mechanism by which we can
// simply change which dimension we want in a single place, and thereby force
// the compiler to recompile the dimension independent class templates for the
// dimension we request. The emphasis here lies on the fact that we only need
// to change a single place. This makes it rather trivial to debug the program
// in 2d where computations are fast, and then switch a single place to a 3 to
// run the much more computing intensive program in 3d for `real'
// computations.
//
// Each of the two blocks is enclosed in braces to make sure that the
// <code>laplace_problem_2d</code> variable goes out of scope (and releases
// the memory it holds) before we move on to allocate memory for the 3d
// case. Without the additional braces, the <code>laplace_problem_2d</code>
// variable would only be destroyed at the end of the function, i.e. after
// running the 3d problem, and would needlessly hog memory while the 3d run
// could actually use it.
//
// Finally, the first line of the function is used to suppress some output.
// Remember that in the previous example, we had the output from the linear
// solvers about the starting residual and the number of the iteration where
// convergence was detected. This can be suppressed through the
// <code>deallog.depth_console(0)</code> call.
//
// The rationale here is the following: the deallog (i.e. deal-log, not
// de-allog) variable represents a stream to which some parts of the library
// write output. It redirects this output to the console and if required to a
// file. The output is nested in a way so that each function can use a prefix
// string (separated by colons) for each line of output; if it calls another
// function, that may also use its prefix which is then printed after the one
// of the calling function. Since output from functions which are nested deep
// below is usually not as important as top-level output, you can give the
// deallog variable a maximal depth of nested output for output to console and
// file. The depth zero which we gave here means that no output is written. By
// changing it you can get more information about the innards of the library.
