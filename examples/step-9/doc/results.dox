<h1>Results</h1>


The results of this program are not particularly spectacular. They
consist of the console output, some grid files, and the solution on
each of these grids. First for the console output:

Quite a number of cells are used on the finest level to resolve the features of
the solution. Here are the fourth and tenth grids:
<div class="twocolumn" style="width: 80%">
  <div>
    <img src="https://dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-9-grid-3.png"
         alt="Fourth grid in the refinement cycle, showing some adaptivity to features."
         width="400" height="400">
  </div>
  <div>
    <img src="https://dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-9-grid-9.png"
         alt="Tenth grid in the refinement cycle, showing that the waves are fully captured."
         width="400" height="400">
  </div>
</div>
and the fourth and tenth solutions:
<div class="twocolumn" style="width: 80%">
  <div>
    <img src="https://dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-9-solution-3.png"
         alt="Fourth solution, showing that we resolve most features but some
         are sill unresolved and appear blury."

  </div>
  <div>

         alt="Tenth solution, showing a fully resolved flow."
         width="400" height="400">
  </div>
</div>
and both the grid and solution zoomed in:

         alt="Detail of the fourth solution, showing that we resolve most
         features but some are sill unresolved and appear blury. In particular,
         the larger cells need to be refined."

         alt="Detail of the tenth solution, showing that we needed a lot more
         cells than were present in the fourth solution."

The solution is created by that part that is transported along the wiggly
advection field from the left and lower boundaries to the top right, and the
part that is created by the source in the lower left corner, and the results of
which are also transported along. The grid shown above is well-adapted to
resolve these features. The comparison between plots shows that, even though we
are using a high-order approximation, we still need adaptive mesh refinement to
fully resolve the wiggles.
