More importantly, we would like to see if the multigrid method really improved
the solver performance. Therefore, here is the textual output:

That's almost perfect multigrid performance: the linear residual gets
reduced by 6 orders of magnitude in 5 or 6 iterations, and the results
are almost independent of the mesh size. That's obviously in part due
to the simple nature of the problem solved, but it also shows the
power of multigrid methods.


<h3> Possibilities for extensions </h3>


We encourage you to generate timings for the solve() call and compare to
step-6. You will see that the multigrid method has quite an overhead
on coarse meshes, but that it always beats other methods on fine
meshes because of its optimal complexity.

A close inspection of this program's performance shows that it is mostly
dominated by matrix-vector operations. step-37 shows one way
how this can be avoided by working with matrix-free methods.

Another avenue would be to use algebraic multigrid methods. The geometric
multigrid method used here can at times be a bit awkward to implement because it
needs all those additional data structures, and it becomes even more difficult
if the program is to run in %parallel on machines coupled through MPI, for
example. In that case, it would be simpler if one could use a black-box
preconditioner that uses some sort of multigrid hierarchy for good performance
but can figure out level matrices and similar things by itself. Algebraic
multigrid methods do exactly this, and we will use them in step-31 for the
solution of a Stokes problem and in step-32 and step-40 for a parallel
variation. That said, a parallel version of this example program with MPI can be
found in step-50.

Finally, one may want to think how to use geometric multigrid for other kinds of
problems, specifically @ref vector_valued "vector valued problems". This is the
topic of step-56 where we use the techniques shown here for the Stokes equation.
