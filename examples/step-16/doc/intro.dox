<h1>Introduction</h1>


This example shows the basic usage of the multilevel functions in deal.II. It
solves almost the same problem as used in step-6, but demonstrating the things
one has to provide when using multigrid as a preconditioner. In particular, this
requires that we define a hierarchy of levels, provide transfer operators from
one level to the next and back, and provide representations of the Laplace
operator on each level.

In order to allow sufficient flexibility in conjunction with systems of
differential equations and block preconditioners, quite a few different objects
have to be created before starting the multilevel method, although
most of what needs to be done is provided by deal.II itself. These are
  - the object handling transfer between grids; we use the MGTransferPrebuilt
    class for this that does almost all of the work inside the library,
  - the solver on the coarsest level; here, we use MGCoarseGridHouseholder,
  - the smoother on all other levels, which in our case will be the
    mg::SmootherRelaxation class using SOR as the underlying method,
  - and mg::Matrix, a class having a special level multiplication, i.e. we
    basically store one matrix per grid level and allow multiplication with it.

Most of these objects will only be needed inside the function that
actually solves the linear system. There, these objects are combined
in an object of type Multigrid, containing the implementation of the
V-cycle, which is in turn used by the preconditioner PreconditionMG,
ready for plug-in into a linear solver of the LAC library.

The multigrid method implemented here for adaptively refined meshes follows the
outline in the @ref mg_paper "Multigrid paper", which describes the underlying
implementation in deal.II and also introduces a lot of the nomenclature. First,
we have to distinguish between level meshes, namely cells that have the same
refinement distance from the coarse mesh, and the leaf mesh consisting of active
cells of the hierarchy (in older work we refer to this as the global mesh, but
this term is overused). Most importantly, the leaf mesh is not identical with
the level mesh on the finest level. The following image shows what we consider
to be a "level mesh":

The fine level in this mesh consists only of the degrees of freedom that are
defined on the refined cells, but does not extend to that part of the domain
that is not refined. While this guarantees that the overall effort grows as
${\cal O}(N)$ as necessary for optimal multigrid complexity, it leads to
problems when defining where to smooth and what boundary conditions to pose for
the operators defined on individual levels if the level boundary is not an
external boundary. These questions are discussed in detail in the article cited
above.

<h3>The testcase</h3>

The problem we solve here is similar to step-6, with two main
differences: first, the multigrid preconditioner, obviously. We also
change the discontinuity of the coefficients such that the local
assembler does not look more complicated than necessary.
