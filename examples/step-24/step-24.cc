  // @sect4{TATForwardProblem::setup_system}

  // The following system is pretty much what we've already done in step-23,
  // but with two important differences. First, we have to create a circular
  // (or spherical) mesh around the origin, with a radius of 1. This nothing
  // new: we've done so before in step-6, step-10, and step-11, where we also
  // explain how to attach a boundary object to a triangulation to be used
  // whenever the triangulation needs to know where new boundary points lie
  // when a cell is refined. Following this, the mesh is refined a number of
  // times.
  //
  // One thing we had to make sure is that the time step satisfies the CFL
  // condition discussed in the introduction of step-23. Back in that program,
  // we ensured this by hand by setting a timestep that matches the mesh
  // width, but that was error prone because if we refined the mesh once more
  // we would also have to make sure the time step is changed. Here, we do
  // that automatically: we ask a library function for the minimal diameter of
  // any cell. Then we set $k=\frac h{c_0}$. The only problem is: what exactly
  // is $h$? The point is that there is really no good theory on this question
  // for the wave equation. It is known that for uniformly refined meshes
  // consisting of rectangles, $h$ is the minimal edge length. But for meshes
  // on general quadrilaterals, the exact relationship appears to be unknown,
  // i.e. it is unknown what properties of cells are relevant for the CFL
  // condition. The problem is that the CFL condition follows from knowledge
  // of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplace matrix, and that can only be
  // computed analytically for simply structured meshes.
  //
  // The upshot of all this is that we're not quite sure what exactly we
  // should take for $h$. The function GridTools::minimal_cell_diameter
  // computes the minimal diameter of all cells. If the cells were all squares
  // or cubes, then the minimal edge length would be the minimal diameter
  // divided by <code>std::sqrt(dim)</code>. We simply generalize this,
  // without theoretical justification, to the case of non-uniform meshes.
  //
  // The only other significant change is that we need to build the boundary
  // mass matrix. We will comment on this further down below.

    // The second difference, as mentioned, to step-23 is that we need to
    // build the boundary mass matrix that grew out of the absorbing boundary
    // conditions.
    //
    // A first observation would be that this matrix is much sparser than the
    // regular mass matrix, since none of the shape functions with purely
    // interior support contribute to this matrix. We could therefore
    // optimize the storage pattern to this situation and build up a second
    // sparsity pattern that only contains the nonzero entries that we
    // need. There is a trade-off to make here: first, we would have to have a
    // second sparsity pattern object, so that costs memory. Secondly, the
    // matrix attached to this sparsity pattern is going to be smaller and
    // therefore requires less memory; it would also be faster to perform
    // matrix-vector multiplications with it. The final argument, however, is
    // the one that tips the scale: we are not primarily interested in
    // performing matrix-vector with the boundary matrix alone (though we need
    // to do that for the right hand side vector once per time step), but
    // mostly wish to add it up to the other matrices used in the first of the
    // two equations since this is the one that is going to be multiplied with
    // once per iteration of the CG method, i.e. significantly more often. It
    // is now the case that the SparseMatrix::add class allows to add one
    // matrix to another, but only if they use the same sparsity pattern (the
    // reason being that we can't add nonzero entries to a matrix after the
    // sparsity pattern has been created, so we simply require that the two
    // matrices have the same sparsity pattern).
    //
    // So let's go with that:
    boundary_matrix.reinit (sparsity_pattern);

    // The second thing to do is to actually build the matrix. Here, we need
    // to integrate over faces of cells, so first we need a quadrature object
    // that works on <code>dim-1</code> dimensional objects. Secondly, the
    // FEFaceValues variant of FEValues that works on faces, as its name
    // suggest. And finally, the other variables that are part of the assembly
    // machinery. All of this we put between curly braces to limit the scope
    // of these variables to where we actually need them.
    //
    // The actual act of assembling the matrix is then fairly straightforward:
    // we loop over all cells, over all faces of each of these cells, and then
    // do something only if that particular face is at the boundary of the
