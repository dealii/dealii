// This is the only new one: in it, we declare the <code>MappingQ</code> class

  // Now, as we want to compute the value of $\pi$, we have to compare to
  // somewhat. These are the first few digits of $\pi$, which we define
  // beforehand for later use. Since we would like to compute the difference
  // between two numbers which are quite accurate, with the accuracy of the
  // computed approximation to $\pi$ being in the range of the number of
  // digits which a double variable can hold, we rather declare the reference
  // value as a <code>long double</code> and give it a number of extra digits:

  // Then, the first task will be to generate some output. Since this program
  // is so small, we do not employ object oriented techniques in it and do not

  // dimensions to conform to usual practice when using deal.II, although we
  // will only use them for two space dimensions.
