// This include file is new. Even if we are not solving a PDE in this tutorial,
// we want to use a dummy finite element with zero degrees of freedoms provided
// by the FE_Nothing class.
#include <deal.II/fe/fe_nothing.h>

// The following header file is also new: in it, we declare the MappingQ class
// which we will use for polynomial mappings of arbitrary order:
#include <deal.II/fe/mapping_q.h>

// And this again is C++:
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cmath>

// The last step is as in previous programs:

  // Now, as we want to compute the value of $\pi$, we have to compare to
  // something. These are the first few digits of $\pi$, which we define
  // beforehand for later use. Since we would like to compute the difference
  // between two numbers which are quite accurate, with the accuracy of the
  // computed approximation to $\pi$ being in the range of the number of
  // digits which a double variable can hold, we rather declare the reference
  // value as a <code>long double</code> and give it a number of extra digits:
  const long double pi = 3.141592653589793238462643L;



  // Then, the first task will be to generate some output. Since this program
  // is so small, we do not employ object oriented techniques in it and do not
  // declare classes (although, of course, we use the object oriented features
  // of the library). Rather, we just pack the functionality into separate
  // functions. We make these functions templates on the number of space
  // dimensions to conform to usual practice when using deal.II, although we
  // will only use them for two space dimensions.
  //
  // The first of these functions just generates a triangulation of a circle
  // (hyperball) and outputs the $Q_p$ mapping of its cells for different values
  // of <code>p</code>. Then, we refine the grid once and do so again.
