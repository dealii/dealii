<h3>Vibrating membrane: Point-to-point interpolation vs. Nitsche-type mortaring</h3>

We compare the results of the simulations after the last time step, i.e. at $t=8T$.
The $y$-component of the velocity field using Nitsche-type mortaring is depicted on the left.
The same field using point-to-point interpolation is depicted on the right.

Besides this, the results for the pressure and the velocity in $y$ direction
are plotted along the horizontal line that spans from (0,0.69) to (1,0.69).

While the results of the pressure are similar, $u_y$ clearly differs. At certain
positions we can see aliasing errors for the point-to-point interpolation.
For different mesh configurations and/or longer run times, the aliasing effects
of the point-to-point simulation accumulate and the simulation becomes instable.
To keep the tutorial short we have chosen one mesh that can be used for all
examples. For a configuration that yields instable results for a wide range of
polynomial degrees, see @cite heinz2022high.

<h3>Wave propagation through in-homogeneous fluid</h3>

The example that follows is just one example in which non-matching discretizations can be efficiently
used to reduce the number of DoFs. The example is nice, since results for a similar
test case are shown in multiple publications. As before, we slightly adapted the
test case to be able to use the same mesh for all simulations. The pressure field
at $t=0.3$ is depicted below.

As expected, we can easily see that the wave length in the right domain is roughly
three times times the wave length in the left domain. Hence, the wave can be
resolved with a coarser discretization.

Using the same element size in the whole domain, we can compute a reference result.
The displayed reference result is obtained by choosing the same subdivision level
for both sub-domains, i.e. @c subdiv_right = 11. In this particular example the
reference result uses $92,928$ DoFs, while the non-matching result uses $52,608$ DoFs.
The pressure result is plotted along the horizontal line that spans from (0,0.5) to (1,0.5).

The results computed using the non-matching discretization are clearly in good agreement with
the reference result.

<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

All the implementations are done with overlapping triangulations in mind. In particular the
intersections in the mortaring case are constructed such that they are computed correctly
for overlapping triangulations. For this the intersection requests are of dimension $dim-1$.
The cells which are intersected with the intersection requests are of dimension $dim$. For the
simple case of non-conforming interfaces it would be sufficient to compute the intersections
between $dim-1$ and $dim-1$ entities. Furthermore, the lambda could be adapted, such that cells are
only marked if they are connected to a certain boundary ID (in this case, e.g., 99) instead of
marking every cell that is <i>not</i> connected to the opposite boundary ID (in this case, e.g., 98).
Marking fewer cells can reduce the setup costs significantly.

Note that the use of inhomogeneous materials in this procedure is questionable, since it is not clear which
material is present in the overlapping part of the mesh.
