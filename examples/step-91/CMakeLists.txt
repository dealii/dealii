#  CMake script for the step-91 tutorial program:

# Set the name of the project and target:
set(TARGET "step-91")

# Declare all source files the target consists of. Here, this is only
# the one step-X.cc file, but as you expand your project you may wish
# to add other source files as well. If your project becomes much larger,
# you may want to either replace the following statement by something like
#    file(GLOB_RECURSE TARGET_SRC  "source/*.cc")
#    file(GLOB_RECURSE TARGET_INC  "include/*.h")
#    set(TARGET_SRC ${TARGET_SRC}  ${TARGET_INC})
# or switch altogether to the large project CMakeLists.txt file discussed
# in the "CMake in user projects" page accessible from the "User info"
# page of the documentation.
set(TARGET_SRC
  ${TARGET}.cc
  )

# Usually, you will not need to modify anything beyond this point...
