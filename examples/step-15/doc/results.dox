Obviously, the scheme converges, if not very fast. We will come back to
strategies for accelerating the method below.

One can visualize the solution after each set of five Newton
iterations, i.e., on each of the meshes on which we approximate the
solution. This yields the following set of images:

It is clearly visible, that the solution minimizes the surface
after each refinement. The solution converges to a picture one
would imagine a soap bubble to be that is located inside a wire loop
that is bent like
the boundary. Also it is visible, how the boundary
is smoothed out after each refinement. On the coarse mesh,
the boundary doesn't look like a sine, whereas it does the
finer the mesh gets.

The mesh is mostly refined near the boundary, where the solution
increases or decreases strongly, whereas it is coarsened on
the inside of the domain, where nothing interesting happens,
because there isn't much change in the solution. The ninth
solution and mesh are shown here:

<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

The program shows the basic structure of a solver for a nonlinear, stationary
problem. However, it does not converge particularly fast, for good reasons:

- The program always takes a step size of 0.1. This precludes the rapid,
  quadratic convergence for which Newton's method is typically chosen.
- It does not connect the nonlinear iteration with the mesh refinement
  iteration.

Obviously, a better program would have to address these two points.
We will discuss them in the following.


<h4> Step length control </h4>

Newton's method has two well known properties:
- It may not converge from arbitrarily chosen starting points. Rather, a
  starting point has to be close enough to the solution to guarantee
  convergence. However, we can enlarge the area from which Newton's method
  converges by damping the iteration using a <i>step length</i> 0<$\alpha^n\le
  1$.
- It exhibits rapid convergence of quadratic order if (i) the step length is
  chosen as $\alpha^n=1$, and (ii) it does in fact converge with this choice
  of step length.

A consequence of these two observations is that a successful strategy is to
choose $\alpha^n<1$ for the initial iterations until the iterate has come
close enough to allow for convergence with full step length, at which point we
want to switch to $\alpha^n=1$. The question is how to choose $\alpha^n$ in an
automatic fashion that satisfies these criteria.

We do not want to review the literature on this topic here, but only briefly
mention that there are two fundamental approaches to the problem: backtracking
line search and trust region methods. The former is more widely used for
partial differential equations and essentially does the following:
- Compute a search direction
- See if the resulting residual of $u^n + \alpha^n\;\delta u^n$ with
  $\alpha^n=1$ is "substantially smaller" than that of $u^n$ alone.
- If so, then take $\alpha^n=1$.
- If not, try whether the residual is "substantially smaller" with
  $\alpha^n=2/3$.
- If so, then take $\alpha^n=2/3$.
- If not, try whether the residual is "substantially smaller" with
  $\alpha^n=(2/3)^2$.
- Etc.
One can of course choose other factors $r, r^2, \ldots$ than the $2/3,
(2/3)^2, \ldots$ chosen above, for $0<r<1$. It is obvious where the term
"backtracking" comes from: we try a long step, but if that doesn't work we try
a shorter step, and ever shorter step, etc. The function
<code>determine_step_length()</code> is written the way it is to support
exactly this kind of use case.

Whether we accept a particular step length $\alpha^n$ depends on how we define
"substantially smaller". There are a number of ways to do so, but without
going into detail let us just mention that the most common ones are to use the
Wolfe and Armijo-Goldstein conditions. For these, one can show the following:
- There is always a step length $\alpha^n$ for which the conditions are
  satisfied, i.e., the iteration never gets stuck as long as the problem is
  convex.
- If we are close enough to the solution, then the conditions allow for
  $\alpha^n=1$, thereby enabling quadratic convergence.

We will not dwell on this here any further but leave the implementation of
such algorithms as an exercise. We note, however, that when implemented
correctly then it is a common observation that most reasonably nonlinear
problems can be solved in anywhere between 5 and 15 Newton iterations to
engineering accuracy &mdash; substantially fewer than we need with the current
version of the program.

More details on globalization methods including backtracking can be found,
for example, in @cite GNS08 and @cite NW99.

A separate point, very much worthwhile making, however, is that in practice
the implementation of efficient nonlinear solvers is about as complicated as
the implementation of efficient finite element methods. One should not
attempt to reinvent the wheel by implementing all of the necessary steps
oneself. Rather, just like building finite element solvers on libraries
such as deal.II, one should be building nonlinear solvers on libraries such
as [SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials). In fact,
deal.II has interfaces to SUNDIALS and in particular to its nonlinear solver
sub-package KINSOL through the SUNDIALS::KINSOL class. It would not be
very difficult to base the current problem on that interface.



<h4> Integrating mesh refinement and nonlinear and linear solvers </h4>

We currently do exactly 5 iterations on each mesh. But is this optimal? One
could ask the following questions:
- Maybe it is worthwhile doing more iterations on the initial meshes since
  there, computations are cheap.
- On the other hand, we do not want to do too many iterations on every mesh:
  yes, we could drive the residual to zero on every mesh, but that would only
  mean that the nonlinear iteration error is far smaller than the
  discretization error.
- Should we use solve the linear systems in each Newton step with higher or
  lower accuracy?

Ultimately, what this boils down to is that we somehow need to couple the
discretization error on the current mesh with the nonlinear residual we want
to achieve with the Newton iterations on a given mesh, and to the linear
iteration we want to achieve with the CG method within each Newton
iterations.

How to do this is, again, not entirely trivial, and we again leave it as a
future exercise.
