<h1>Introduction</h1>

The aim of this tutorial is, quite simply, to introduce the fundamentals of both
[automatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation)
and [symbolic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra)
(respectively abbreviated as AD
and SD): Ways in which one can, in source code, describe a function
$\mathbf f(\mathbf x)$ and automatically also obtain a representation of derivatives
$\nabla \mathbf f(\mathbf x)$ (the "Jacobian"),
$\nabla^2 \mathbf f(\mathbf x)$ (the "Hessian"), etc., without having
to write additional lines of code. Doing this is quite helpful in
solving nonlinear or optimization problems where one would like to
only describe the nonlinear equation or the objective function in the
code, without having to also provide their derivatives (which are
necessary for a Newton method for solving a nonlinear problem, or for
finding a minimizer).

Since AD and SD tools are somewhat independent of finite elements and boundary value
problems, this tutorial is going to be different to the others that you may have
read beforehand. It will focus specifically on how these frameworks work and
the principles and thinking behind them, and will forgo looking at them in the
direct context of a finite element simulation.

We will, in fact, look at two different sets of problems that have greatly
different levels of complexity, but when framed properly hold sufficient
similarity that the same AD and SD frameworks can be leveraged. With these
examples the aim is to build up an understanding of the steps that are required
to use the AD and SD tools, the differences between them, and hopefully identify
where they could be immediately be used in order to improve or simplify existing
code.

It's plausible that you're wondering what AD and SD are, in the first place. Well,
that question is easy to answer but without context is not very insightful. So
we're not going to cover that in this introduction, but will rather defer this
until the first introductory example where we lay out the key points as this
example unfolds. To complement this, we should mention that the core theory for
both frameworks is extensively discussed in the @ref auto_symb_diff topic, so
it bears little repeating here.

Since we have to pick *some* sufficiently interesting topic to investigate
and identify where AD and SD can be used effectively, the main problem that's
implemented in the second half of the tutorial is one of modeling a coupled
constitutive law, specifically a magneto-active material (with hysteretic effects).
As a means of an introduction to that, later in the introduction some grounding
theory for that class of materials will be presented.
Naturally, this is not a field (or even a class of materials) that is of
interest to a wide audience. Therefore, the author wishes to express up front
that this theory and any subsequent derivations mustn't be considered the focus
of this tutorial. Instead, keep in mind the complexity of the problem that arises
from the relatively innocuous description of the constitutive law, and what we
might (in the context of a boundary value problem) need to derive from that.
We will perform some computations with these constitutive laws at the level of a
representative continuum point (so, remaining in the  realm of continuum
mechanics), and will produce some benchmark results around which we can frame
a final discussion on the topic of computational performance.

Once we have the foundation upon which we can build further concepts, we
will see how AD in particular can be exploited at a finite element (rather than
continuum) level: this is a topic that is covered in step-72, as well as step-33.
But before then, let's take a moment to think about why we might want to consider
using these sorts of tools, and what benefits they can potentially offer you.


<h3>A motivation: Why would I use these tools?</h3>

The primary driver for using AD or SD is typically that there is some situation
that requires differentiation to be performed, and that doing so is sufficiently
challenging to make the prospect of using an external tool to perform that specific
task appealing. A broad categorization for the circumstances under which AD or
SD can be rendered most useful include (but are probably not limited to) the
following:
- <b>Rapid prototyping:</b> For a new class of problems where you're trying to
  implement a solution quickly, and want to remove some of the intricate details
  (in terms of both the mathematics as well as the organizational structure of
  the code itself). You might be willing to justify any additional computational
  cost, which would be offset by an increased agility in restructuring your code
  or modifying the part of the problem that is introducing some complex nonlinearity
  with minimal effort.
- <b>Complex problems:</b> It could very well be that some problems just happen to have
  a nonlinearity that is incredibly challenging to linearize or formulate by hand.
  Having this challenge taken care of for you by a tool that is, for the most part,
  robust, reliable, and accurate may alleviate some of the pains in implementing
  certain problems. Examples of this include step-15, where the
  derivative of the nonlinear PDE we solve is not incredibly difficult
  to derive, but sufficiently cumbersome that one has to pay attention
  in doing so by hand, and where implementing the corresponding finite
  element formulation of the Newton step takes more than just the few
  lines that it generally takes to implement the bilinear form;
  step-33 (where we actually use AD) is an even more extreme example.
- <b>Verification:</b> For materials and simulations that exhibit nonlinear response,
  an accurate rather than only approximate material tangent (the term mechanical engineers use for
  the derivative of a material law) can be the difference between convergent and
  divergent behavior, especially at high external (or coupling) loads.
  As the complexity of the problem increases, so do the opportunities to introduce
  subtle (or, perhaps, not-so-subtle) errors that produce predictably negative
  results.
  Additionally, there is a lot to be gained by verifying that the implementation is
  completely correct. For example, certain categories of problems are known to exhibit
  instabilities, and therefore when you start to lose quadratic convergence in a
  nonlinear solver (e.g., Newton's method) then this may not be a huge surprise to
  the investigator. However, it is hard (if not impossible) to distinguish between
  convergence behavior that is produced as you near an unstable solution and when
  you simply have an error in the material or finite element linearization, and
  start to drift off the optimal convergence path due to that. Having a
  method of verifying the correctness of the implementation of a constitutive law
  linearization, for example, is perhaps the only meaningful way that you can
  use to catch such errors, assuming that you've got nobody else to scrutinize your code.
  Thankfully, with some tactical programming it is quite straight-forward to structure
  a code for reuse, such that you can use the same classes in production code and
  directly verify them in, for instance, a unit-test framework.

This tutorial program will have two parts: One where we just introduce
the basic ideas of automatic and symbolic differentiation support in
deal.II using a simple set of examples; and one where we apply this to
a realistic but much more complicated case. For that second half, the
next section will provide some background on magneto-mechanical
materials -- you can skip this section if all you want to learn
about is what AD and SD actually are, but you probably want to read
over this section if you are interested in how to apply AD and SD for
concrete situations.


<h3>Theory for magneto-mechanical materials</h3>

<h4>Thermodynamic principles</h4>

As a prelude to introducing the coupled magneto-mechanical material law that we'll use
to model a magneto-active polymer, we'll start with a very concise summary of
the salient thermodynamics to which these constitutive laws must subscribe.
The basis for the theory, as summarized here, is described in copious detail by
Truesdell and Toupin @cite Truesdell1960a and Coleman and Noll @cite Coleman1963a,
and follows the logic laid out by Holzapfel @cite Holzapfel2007a.

Starting from the first law of thermodynamics, and following a few technical
assumptions, it can be shown the balance between the kinetic plus internal
energy rates and the power supplied to the system from external
sources is given by the following relationship that equates the rate
of change of the energy in an (arbitrary) volume $V$ on the left, and
the sum of forces acting on that volume on the right:
@f[
  D_{t} \int\limits_{V} \left[
    \frac{1}{2} \rho_{0} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v}
    + U^{*}_{0} \right] dV
= \int\limits_{V} \left[
  \rho_{0} \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{a}
  + \mathbf{P}^{\text{tot}} : \dot{\mathbf{F}}
  + \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}
  + \mathbb{E} \cdot \dot{\mathbb{D}}
  - D_{t} M^{*}_{0}
  - \nabla_{0} \cdot \mathbf{Q}
  + R_{0} \right] dV .
@f]
Here $D_{t}$ represents the total time derivative,
$\rho_{0}$ is the material density as measured in the Lagrangian reference frame,
$\mathbf{v}$ is the material velocity and $\mathbf{a}$ its acceleration,
$U^{*}_{0}$ is the internal energy per unit reference volume,
$\mathbf{P}^{\text{tot}}$ is the total Piola stress tensor and $\dot{\mathbf{F}}$ is
the time rate of the deformation gradient tensor,
$\boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}$ are, respectively, the magnetic field vector and the
magnetic induction (or magnetic flux density) vector,
$\mathbb{E}$ and $\mathbb{D}$ are the electric field vector and electric
displacement vector, and
$\mathbf{Q}$ and $R_{0}$ represent the referential thermal flux vector and thermal
source.
The material differential operator
$\nabla_{0} (\bullet) \dealcoloneq \frac{d(\bullet)}{d\mathbf{X}}$
where $\mathbf{X}$ is the material position vector.
With some rearrangement of terms, invoking the arbitrariness of the integration
volume $V$, the total internal energy density rate $\dot{E}_{0}$ can be identified as
@f[
  \dot{E}_{0}
= \mathbf{P}^{\text{tot}} : \dot{\mathbf{F}}
  + \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}
  + \mathbb{E} \cdot \dot{\mathbb{D}}
  - \nabla_{0} \cdot \mathbf{Q}
  + R_{0} .
@f]
The total internal energy includes contributions that arise not only due to
mechanical deformation (the first term), and thermal fluxes and sources (the
fourth and fifth terms), but also due to the intrinsic energy stored in the
magnetic and electric fields themselves (the second and third terms,
respectively).

The second law of thermodynamics, known also as the entropy inequality principle,
informs us that certain thermodynamic processes are irreversible. After accounting
for the total entropy and rate of entropy input, the Clausius-Duhem inequality
can be derived. In local form (and in the material configuration), this reads
@f[
  \theta \dot{\eta}_{0}
  - R_{0}
  + \nabla_{0} \cdot \mathbf{Q}
  - \frac{1}{\theta} \nabla_{0} \theta \cdot \mathbf{Q}
  \geq 0 .
@f]
The quantity $\theta$ is the absolute temperature, and
$\eta_{0}$ represents the entropy per unit reference volume.

Using this to replace $R_{0} - \nabla_{0} \cdot \mathbf{Q}$ in the result
stemming from the first law of thermodynamics, we now have the relation
@f[
  \mathbf{P}^{\text{tot}} : \dot{\mathbf{F}}
  + \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}
  + \mathbb{E} \cdot \dot{\mathbb{D}}
  + \theta \dot{\eta}_{0}
  - \dot{E}_{0}
  - \frac{1}{\theta} \nabla_{0} \theta \cdot \mathbf{Q}
  \geq 0 .
@f]
On the basis of Fourier's law, which informs us that heat flows from regions
of high temperature to low temperature, the last term is always positive and
can be ignored.
This renders the local dissipation inequality
@f[
  \mathbf{P}^{\text{tot}} : \dot{\mathbf{F}}
  + \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}
  + \mathbb{E} \cdot \dot{\mathbb{D}}
  - \left[ \dot{E}_{0} - \theta \dot{\eta}_{0}  \right]
  \geq 0 .
@f]
It is postulated @cite Holzapfel2007a that the Legendre transformation
@f[
  \psi^{*}_{0}
= \psi^{*}_{0} \left( \mathbf{F}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}, \mathbb{D}, \theta \right)
= E_{0} - \theta \eta_{0} ,
@f]
from which we may define the free energy density function $\psi^{*}_{0}$ with the stated
parameterization, exists and is valid.
Taking the material rate of this equation and substituting it into the local
dissipation inequality results in the generic expression
@f[
  \mathcal{D}_{\text{int}}
  = \mathbf{P}^{\text{tot}} : \dot{\mathbf{F}}
  + \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}
  + \mathbb{E} \cdot \dot{\mathbb{D}}
  - \dot{\theta} \eta_{0}
  - \dot{\psi}^{*}_{0} \left( \mathbf{F}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}, \mathbb{D}, \theta \right)
  \geq 0 .
@f]
Under the assumption of isothermal conditions, and that the electric field does
not excite the material in a manner that is considered non-negligible, then this
dissipation inequality reduces to
@f[
  \mathcal{D}_{\text{int}}
  = \mathbf{P}^{\text{tot}} : \dot{\mathbf{F}}
  + \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}
  - \dot{\psi}^{*}_{0} \left( \mathbf{F}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}} \right)
  \geq 0 .
@f]

<h4>Constitutive laws</h4>

When considering materials that exhibit mechanically dissipative behavior,
it can be shown that this can be captured within the dissipation inequality
through the augmentation of the material free energy density function with additional
parameters that represent internal variables @cite Holzapfel1996a. Consequently,
we write it as
@f[
  \mathcal{D}_{\text{int}}
  = \mathbf{P}^{\text{tot}} : \dot{\mathbf{F}}
  + \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}
  - \dot{\psi}^{*}_{0} \left( \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{F}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}} \right)
  \geq 0 .
@f]
where $\mathbf{F}_{v}^{i} = \mathbf{F}_{v}^{i} \left( t \right)$ represents the
internal variable (which acts like a measure of the deformation gradient)
associated with the `i`th mechanical dissipative (viscous) mechanism.
As can be inferred from its parameterization, each of these internal parameters
is considered to evolve in time.
Currently the free energy density function $\psi^{*}_{0}$ is parameterized in terms of
the magnetic induction $\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}$. This is the natural parameterization that
comes as a consequence of the considered balance laws. Should such a class of
materials to be incorporated within a finite-element model, it would be ascertained
that a certain formulation of the magnetic problem, known as the magnetic vector
potential formulation, would need to be adopted. This has its own set of challenges,
so where possible the more simple magnetic scalar potential formulation may be
preferred. In that case, the magnetic problem needs to be parameterized in terms
of the magnetic field $\boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}$. To make this re-parameterization, we execute
a final Legendre transformation
@f[
  \tilde{\psi}_{0} \left( \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{F}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  = \psi^{*}_{0} \left( \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{F}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}} \right)
  - \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}} .
@f]
At the same time, we may take advantage of the principle of material frame
indifference in order to express the energy density function in terms of symmetric
deformation measures:
@f[
  \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  = \tilde{\psi}_{0} \left( \mathbf{F}, \mathbf{F}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right) .
@f]
The upshot of these two transformations (leaving out considerable explicit and
hidden details) renders the final expression for the reduced dissipation
inequality as
@f[
  \mathcal{D}_{\text{int}}
  = \mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}} : \frac{1}{2} \dot{\mathbf{C}}
  - \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}} \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}}
  - \dot{\psi}_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  \geq 0 .
@f]
(Notice the sign change on the second term on the right hand side, and the
transfer of the time derivative to the magnetic induction vector.)
The stress quantity $\mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}}$ is known as the total Piola-Kirchhoff
stress tensor and its energy conjugate $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{F}^{T} \cdot \mathbf{F}$
is the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, and
$\mathbf{C}_{v}^{i} = \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i} \left( t \right)$ is the re-parameterized
internal variable associated with the `i`th mechanical dissipative (viscous)
mechanism.

Expansion of the material rate of the energy density function, and rearrangement of the
various terms, results in the expression
@f[
  \mathcal{D}_{\text{int}}
  = \left[ \mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}} - 2 \frac{\partial \psi_{0}}{\partial \mathbf{C}} \right] : \frac{1}{2} \dot{\mathbf{C}}
  - \sum\limits_{i}\left[ 2 \frac{\partial \psi_{0}}{\partial \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}} \right] : \frac{1}{2} \dot{\mathbf{C}}_{v}^{i}
  + \left[ - \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}} - \frac{\partial \psi_{0}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} \right] \cdot \dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}}
  \geq 0 .
@f]
At this point, its worth noting the use of the
[partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative)
$\partial \left( \bullet \right)$. This is an important detail that will be
fundamental to a certain design choice made within the tutorial.
As brief reminder of what this signifies, the partial derivative of a
multi-variate function returns the derivative of that function with respect
to one of those variables while holding the others constant:
@f[
  \frac{\partial f\left(x, y\right)}{\partial x}
  = \frac{d f\left(x, y\right)}{d x} \Big\vert_{y} .
@f]
More specific to what's encoded in the dissipation inequality (with the very general
free energy density function $\psi_{0}$ with its parameterization yet to be formalized),
if one of the input variables is a function of another, it is also held constant
and the chain rule does not propagate any further, while the computing total
derivative would imply judicious use of the chain rule. This can be better
understood by comparing the following two statements:
@f{align*}{
  \frac{\partial f\left(x, y\left(x\right)\right)}{\partial x}
  &= \frac{d f\left(x, y\left(x\right)\right)}{d x} \Big\vert_{y} \\
  \frac{d f\left(x, y\left(x\right)\right)}{d x}
  &= \frac{d f\left(x, y\left(x\right)\right)}{d x} \Big\vert_{y}
   + \frac{d f\left(x, y\left(x\right)\right)}{d y} \Big\vert_{x} \frac{d y\left(x\right)}{x} .
@f}

Returning to the thermodynamics of the problem, we next exploit the arbitrariness
of the quantities $\dot{\mathbf{C}}$ and $\dot{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}}$,
by application of the Coleman-Noll procedure @cite Coleman1963a, @cite Coleman1967a.
This leads to the identification of the kinetic conjugate quantities
@f[
  \mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}}
  = \mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  \dealcoloneq 2 \frac{\partial \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{\partial \mathbf{C}} , \\
  \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}
  = \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  \dealcoloneq - \frac{\partial \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} .
@f]
(Again, note the use of the partial derivatives to define the stress and magnetic
induction in this generalized setting.)
From what terms remain in the dissipative power (namely those related to the
mechanical dissipative mechanisms), if they are assumed to be independent of
one another then, for each mechanism `i`,
@f[
  \frac{\partial \psi_{0}}{\partial \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}} : \dot{\mathbf{C}}_{v}^{i}
  \leq 0 .
@f]
This constraint must be satisfied through the appropriate choice of free energy
function, as well as a carefully considered evolution law for the internal
variables.

In the case that there are no dissipative mechanisms to be captured within the
constitutive model (e.g., if the material to be modelled is magneto-hyperelastic)
then the free energy density function
$\psi_{0} = \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)$ reduces to a stored
energy density function, and the total stress and magnetic induction can be simplified
@f{align*}{
  \mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}}
  = \mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  &\dealcoloneq 2 \frac{d \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{d \mathbf{C}} , \\
  \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}
  = \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  &\dealcoloneq - \frac{d \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} ,
@f}
where the operator $d$ denotes the total derivative operation.

For completeness, the linearization of the stress tensor and magnetic induction
are captured within the fourth-order total referential elastic tangent tensor
$\mathcal{H}^{\text{tot}} $, the second-order magnetostatic tangent tensor $\mathbb{D}$ and the
third-order total referential magnetoelastic coupling tensor $\mathfrak{P}^{\text{tot}}$.
Irrespective of the parameterization of $\mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}$,
these quantities may be computed by
@f{align*}{
  \mathcal{H}^{\text{tot}}
  &= 2 \frac{d \mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}}}{d \mathbf{C}} , \\
  \mathbb{D}
  &= \frac{d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}{d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} , \\
  \mathfrak{P}^{\text{tot}}
  &= - \frac{d \mathbf{S}^{\text{tot}}}{d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} , \\
  \left[ \mathfrak{P}^{\text{tot}} \right]^{T}
  &= 2 \frac{d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{B}}}{d \mathbf{C}} .
@f}
For the case of rate-dependent materials, this expands to
@f{align*}{
  \mathcal{H}^{\text{tot}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  &= 4 \frac{d^{2} \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{\partial \mathbf{C} \otimes d \mathbf{C}} , \\
  \mathbb{D} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  &= -\frac{d^{2} \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \otimes d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} , \\
  \mathfrak{P}^{\text{tot}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  &= - 2 \frac{d^{2} \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \otimes d \mathbf{C}} , \\
  \left[ \mathfrak{P}^{\text{tot}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)  \right]^{T}
  &= - 2 \frac{d^{2} \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \mathbf{C}_{v}^{i}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{\partial \mathbf{C} \otimes d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} ,
@f}
while for rate-independent materials the linearizations are
@f{align*}{
  \mathcal{H}^{\text{tot}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  &= 4 \frac{d^{2} \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{d \mathbf{C} \otimes d \mathbf{C}} , \\
  \mathbb{D} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  &= -\frac{d^{2} \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \otimes d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} , \\
  \mathfrak{P}^{\text{tot}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
  &= - 2 \frac{d^{2} \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \otimes d \mathbf{C}} , \\
  \left[ \mathfrak{P}^{\text{tot}} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)  \right]^{T}
  &= - 2 \frac{d^{2} \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)}{d \mathbf{C} \otimes d \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}} .
@f}
The subtle difference between them is the application of a partial derivative during
the calculation of the first derivatives. We'll see later how this affects the choice
of AD versus SD for this specific application. For now, we'll simply introduce
the two specific materials that are implemented within this tutorial.

<h5>Magnetoelastic constitutive law</h5>

The first material that we'll consider is one that is governed by a
magneto-hyperelastic constitutive law. This material responds to both
deformation as well as immersion in a magnetic field, but exhibits no
time- or history-dependent behavior (such as dissipation through viscous
damping or magnetic hysteresis, etc.). The *stored energy density
function* for such a material is only parameterized in terms of the
(current) field variables, but not their time derivatives or past values.

We'll choose the energy density function, which captures both the energy
stored in the material due to deformation and magnetization, as well as
the energy stored in the magnetic field itself, to be
@f[
  \psi_{0} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
= \frac{1}{2} \mu_{e} f_{\mu_{e}} \left( \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
    \left[ \text{tr}(\mathbf{C}) - d - 2 \ln (\text{det}(\mathbf{F}))
    \right]
+ \lambda_{e} \ln^{2} \left(\text{det}(\mathbf{F}) \right)
- \frac{1}{2} \mu_{0} \mu_{r} \text{det}(\mathbf{F})
    \left[ \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot \mathbf{C}^{-1} \cdot
    \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right]
@f]
with
@f[
  f_{\mu_{e}} \left( \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)
= 1 + \left[ \frac{\mu_{e}^{\infty}}{\mu_{e}} - 1 \right]
    \tanh \left( 2 \frac{\boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \cdot
    \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}}}
      {\left(h_{e}^{\text{sat}}\right)^{2}} \right)
@f]
and for which the variable $d = \text{tr}(\mathbf{I})$ ($\mathbf{I}$
being the rank-2 identity tensor) represents the spatial dimension and
$\mathbf{F}$ is the deformation gradient tensor. To give some brief
background to the various components of $\psi_{0}$, the first two terms
bear a great resemblance to the stored energy density function for a
(hyperelastic) Neohookean material. The only difference between what's
used here and the Neohookean material is the scaling of the elastic shear
modulus by the magnetic field-sensitive saturation function $f_{\mu_{e}}
\left( \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)$ (see @cite Pelteret2018a, equation
29). This function will, in effect, cause the material to stiffen in the
presence of a strong magnetic field. As it is governed by a sigmoid-type
function, the shear modulus will asymptotically converge on the specified
saturation shear modulus. It can also be shown that the last term in
$\psi_{0}$ is the stored energy density function for magnetic field (as
derived from first principles), scaled by the relative permeability
constant. This definition collectively implies that the material is
linearly magnetized, i.e., the magnetization vector and magnetic field
vector are aligned. (This is certainly not obvious with the magnetic energy
stated in its current form, but when the magnetic induction and magnetization
are derived from $\psi_{0}$ and all magnetic fields are expressed in the
<em>current configuration</em> then this correlation becomes clear.)
As for the specifics of what the magnetic induction, stress tensor, and the
various material tangents look like, we'll defer presenting these to the
tutorial body where the full, unassisted implementation of the constitutive
law is defined.

<h5>Magneto-viscoelastic constitutive law</h5>

The second material that we'll formulate is one for a
magneto-viscoelastic material with a single dissipative mechanism `i`.
The *free energy density function* that we'll be considering is defined as
@f{align*}{

for the internal viscous variable.
We've chosen the magnetoelastic part of the energy
$\psi_{0}^{ME} \left( \mathbf{C}, \boldsymbol{\mathbb{H}} \right)$
to match that of the first material model that we explored, so this part
needs no further explanation. As for the viscous part $\psi_{0}^{MVE}$,
this component of the free energy (in conjunction with the evolution law for
the viscous deformation tensor) is taken from @cite Linder2011a (with the
additional scaling by the viscous saturation function described in
@cite Pelteret2018a). It is derived in a thermodynamically consistent
framework that, at its core, models the movement of polymer chains on a
micro-scale level.

To proceed beyond this point, we'll also need to consider the time
discretization of the evolution law.
Choosing the implicit first-order backwards difference scheme, then
@f[
  \dot{\mathbf{C}}_{v}
\approx \frac{\mathbf{C}_{v}^{(t)} - \mathbf{C}_{v}^{(t-1)}}{\Delta t}
= \frac{1}{\tau} \left[
      \left[\left[\text{det}\left(\mathbf{F}\right)\right]^{-\frac{2}{d}}
        \mathbf{C}\right]^{-1}
    - \mathbf{C}_{v}^{(t)} \right]
@f]
where the superscript $(t)$ denotes that the quantity is taken at the
current timestep, and $(t-1)$ denotes quantities taken at the previous
timestep (i.e., a history variable). The timestep size $\Delta t$ is the
difference between the current time and that of the previous timestep.
Rearranging the terms so that all internal variable quantities at the
current time are on the left hand side of the equation, we get
@f[
\mathbf{C}_{v}^{(t)}
= \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\Delta t}{\tau_{v}}} \left[
    \mathbf{C}_{v}^{(t-1)}
  + \frac{\Delta t}{\tau_{v}}
    \left[\left[\text{det}\left(\mathbf{F}\right)\right]^{-\frac{2}{d}}
    \mathbf{C} \right]^{-1}
  \right]
@f]
that matches @cite Linder2011a equation 54.

<h3>Rheological experiment</h3>

Now that we have shown all of these formulas for the thermodynamics and theory
governing magneto-mechanics and constitutive models, let us outline what the
program will do with all of this.
We wish to do something *meaningful* with the materials laws that we've formulated,
and so it makes sense to subject them to some mechanical and magnetic loading
conditions that are, in some way, representative of some conditions that might
be found either in an application or in a laboratory setting. One way to achieve
that aim would be to embed these constitutive laws in a finite element model to
simulate a device. In this instance, though, we'll keep things simple (we are
focusing on the automatic and symbolic differentiation concepts, after all)
and will find a concise way to faithfully replicate an industry-standard
rheological experiment using an analytical expression for the loading conditions.

The rheological experiment that we'll reproduce,
which idealizes a laboratory experiment that was used to characterize
magneto-active polymers, is detailed in @cite Pelteret2018a
(as well as @cite Pelteret2019a, in which it is documented along with the
real-world experiments). The images below provide a visual description of
the problem set up.

Under the assumptions that an incompressible medium is being tested,
and that the deformation profile through the sample thickness is linear,
then the displacement at some measurement point $\mathbf{X}$ within
the sample, expressed in radial coordinates, is
@f{align*}{
  r(\mathbf{X})
  &= \frac{R(X_{1}, X_{2})}{\sqrt{\lambda_{3}}} , \\
  \theta(\mathbf{X})
  & = \Theta(X_{1}, X_{2}) + \underbrace{\tau(t)
       \lambda_{3} X_{3}}_{\alpha(X_{3}, t)} , \\
  z(\mathbf{X})
  &= \lambda_{3} X_{3}
@f}
where
$R(X_{1}, X_{2})$ and $\Theta(X_{1}, X_{2})$ are the radius at
-- and angle of -- the sampling point,
$\lambda_{3}$ is the (constant) axial deformation,
$\tau(t) = \frac{A}{RH} \sin\left(\omega t\right)$ is the time-dependent
torsion angle per unit length that will be prescribed using a
sinusoidally repeating oscillation of fixed amplitude $A$.
The magnetic field is aligned axially, i.e., in the $X_{3}$ direction.

This summarizes everything that we need to fully characterize the idealized
loading at any point within the rheological sample. We'll set up the problem
in such a way that we "pick" a representative point with this sample, and
subject it to a harmonic shear deformation at a constant axial deformation
(by default, a compressive load) and a constant, axially applied magnetic
field. We will record the stress and magnetic induction at this point, and
will output that data to file for post-processing. Although its not necessary
for this particular problem, we will also be computing the tangents as well.
Even though they are not directly used in this particular piece of work, these
second derivatives are needed to embed the constitutive law within a
finite element model (one possible extension to this work). We'll therefore
take the opportunity to check our hand calculations for correctness using
the assisted differentiation frameworks.

<h3>Suggested literature</h3>

In addition to the already mentioned @ref auto_symb_diff topic, the following are a few
references that discuss in more detail
- magneto-mechanics, and some aspects of automated differentiation frameworks: @cite Pao1978a, @cite Pelteret2019a, and
- the automation of finite element frameworks using AD and/or SD: @cite Logg2012a, @cite Korelc2016a.
