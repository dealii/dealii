<h1>Introduction</h1>


In real life, most partial differential equations are really systems
of equations. Accordingly, the solutions are usually
vector-valued. The deal.II library supports such problems (see the
extensive documentation in the @ref vector_valued topic), and we will show
that that is mostly rather simple. The only more complicated problems
are in assembling matrix and right hand side, but these are easily
understood as well.

In this tutorial program we will want to solve the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_elasticity">elastic equations</a>.
They are an extension to Laplace's equation with a vector-valued solution that
describes the displacement in each space direction of a rigid body
which is subject to a force. Of course, the force is also
vector-valued, meaning that in each point it has a direction and an
absolute value.

One can write the elasticity equations in a number of ways. The one that shows
the symmetry with the Laplace equation in the most obvious way is to write it
as
@f[
  -
  \text{div}\,
  ({\mathbf C} \nabla \mathbf{u})
  =
  \mathbf f,
@f]
where $\mathbf u$ is the vector-valued displacement at each point,
$\mathbf f$ the force, and ${\mathbf C}$ is a rank-4 tensor (i.e., it has four
indices) that encodes the stress-strain relationship -- in essence,
it represents the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">"spring constant"</a> in
Hookes law that relates the displacement to the forces. ${\mathbf C}$ will, in many
cases, depend on $\mathbf x$ if the body whose deformation we want to
simulate is composed of different materials.

While the form of the equations above is correct, it is not the way
they are usually derived. In truth, the gradient of the displacement
$\nabla\mathbf u$ (a matrix) has no physical meaning whereas its
symmetrized version,
@f[
\varepsilon(\mathbf u)_{kl} =\frac{1}{2}(\partial_k u_l + \partial_l u_k),
@f]
does and is typically called the "strain". (Here and in the following,
$\partial_k=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}$. We will also use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation">Einstein summation
convention</a> that whenever the same index appears twice in an equation,
summation over this index is implied; we will, however, not distinguish
between upper and lower indices.)
With this definition of the strain, the elasticity equations
then read as
@f[
  -
  \text{div}\,
  ({\mathbf C} \varepsilon(\mathbf u))
  =
  \mathbf f,
@f]
which you can think of as the more natural generalization of the Laplace
equation to vector-valued problems. (The form shown first is equivalent to
this form because the tensor ${\mathbf C}$ has certain symmetries, namely that
$C_{ijkl}=C_{ijlk}$, and consequently ${\mathbf C} \varepsilon(\mathbf u)_{kl}
= {\mathbf C} \nabla\mathbf u$.)

One can of course alternatively write these equations in component form:
@f[
  -
  \partial_j (c_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{kl})
  =
  f_i,
  \qquad
  i=1\ldots d.
@f]

In many cases, one knows that the material under consideration is
isotropic, in which case by introduction of the two coefficients
$\lambda$ and $\mu$ the coefficient tensor reduces to
@f[
  c_{ijkl}
  =
  \lambda \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl} +
  \mu (\delta_{ik} \delta_{jl} + \delta_{il} \delta_{jk}).
@f]

The elastic equations can then be rewritten in much simpler a form:
@f[
   -
   \nabla \lambda (\nabla\cdot {\mathbf u})
   -
   (\nabla \cdot \mu \nabla) {\mathbf u}
   -
   \nabla\cdot \mu (\nabla {\mathbf u})^T
   =
   {\mathbf f},
@f]
and the respective bilinear form is then
@f[
  a({\mathbf u}, {\mathbf v}) =
  \left(
    \lambda \nabla\cdot {\mathbf u}, \nabla\cdot {\mathbf v}
  \right)_\Omega
  +
  \sum_{k,l}
  \left(
    \mu \partial_k u_l, \partial_k v_l
  \right)_\Omega
  +
  \sum_{k,l}
  \left(
    \mu \partial_k u_l, \partial_l v_k
  \right)_\Omega,
@f]
or also writing the first term a sum over components:
@f[
  a({\mathbf u}, {\mathbf v}) =
  \sum_{k,l}
  \left(
    \lambda \partial_l u_l, \partial_k v_k
  \right)_\Omega
  +
  \sum_{k,l}
  \left(
    \mu \partial_k u_l, \partial_k v_l
  \right)_\Omega
  +
  \sum_{k,l}
  \left(
    \mu \partial_k u_l, \partial_l v_k
  \right)_\Omega.
@f]

@note As written, the equations above are generally considered to be the right
description for the displacement of three-dimensional objects if the
displacement is small and we can assume that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookes_law">Hooke's law</a> is valid. In
that case, the indices $i,j,k,l$ above all run over the set $\{1,2,3\}$ (or,
in the C++ source, over $\{0,1,2\}$). However, as is, the program runs in 2d,
and while the equations above also make mathematical sense in that case, they
would only describe a truly two-dimensional solid. In particular, they are not
the appropriate description of an $x-y$ cross-section of a body infinite in
the $z$ direction; this is in contrast to many other two-dimensional equations
that can be obtained by assuming that the body has infinite extent in
$z$-direction and that the solution function does not depend on the $z$
coordinate. On the other hand, there are equations for two-dimensional models
of elasticity; see for example the Wikipedia article on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_strain_theory#Special_cases">plane
strain</a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiplane_shear">antiplane shear</a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_stress#Plane_stress">plan stress</a>.

But let's get back to the original problem.
How do we assemble the matrix for such an equation? A very long answer
with a number of different alternatives is given in the documentation of the
@ref vector_valued topic. Historically, the solution shown below was the only
one available in the early years of the library. It turns out to also be the
fastest. On the other hand, if a few per cent of compute time do not matter,
there are simpler and probably more intuitive ways to assemble the linear
system than the one discussed below but that weren't available until several
years after this tutorial program was first written; if you are interested in
them, take a look at the @ref vector_valued topic.

Let us go back to the question of how to assemble the linear system. The first
thing we need is some knowledge about how the shape functions work in the case
of vector-valued finite elements. Basically, this comes down to the following:
let $n$ be the number of shape functions for the scalar finite element of
which we build the vector element (for example, we will use bilinear functions
for each component of the vector-valued finite element, so the scalar finite
element is the <code>FE_Q(1)</code> element which we have used in previous
examples already, and $n=4$ in two space dimensions). Further, let $N$ be the
number of shape functions for the vector element; in two space dimensions, we
need $n$ shape functions for each component of the vector, so $N=2n$. Then,
the $i$th shape function of the vector element has the form
@f[
  \Phi_i({\mathbf x}) = \varphi_{\text{base}(i)}({\mathbf x})\ {\mathbf e}_{\text{comp}(i)},
@f]
where $e_l$ is the $l$th unit vector, $\text{comp}(i)$ is the function that tells
us which component of $\Phi_i$ is the one that is nonzero (for
each vector shape function, only one component is nonzero, and all others are
zero). $\varphi_{\text{base}(i)}(x)$ describes the space dependence of the shape
function, which is taken to be the $\text{base}(i)$-th shape function of the scalar
element. Of course, while $i$ is in the range $0,\ldots,N-1$, the functions
$\text{comp}(i)$ and $\text{base}(i)$ have the ranges $0,1$ (in 2D) and $0,\ldots,n-1$,
respectively.

For example (though this sequence of shape functions is not
guaranteed, and you should not rely on it),
the following layout could be used by the library:
@f{eqnarray*}{
  \Phi_0({\mathbf x}) &=&
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    \varphi_0({\mathbf x}) \\ 0
  \end{array}\right),
  \\
  \Phi_1({\mathbf x}) &=&
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    0 \\ \varphi_0({\mathbf x})
  \end{array}\right),
  \\
  \Phi_2({\mathbf x}) &=&
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    \varphi_1({\mathbf x}) \\ 0
  \end{array}\right),
  \\
  \Phi_3({\mathbf x}) &=&
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
    0 \\ \varphi_1({\mathbf x})
  \end{array}\right),
  \ldots
@f}
where here
@f[
  \text{comp}(0)=0, \quad  \text{comp}(1)=1, \quad  \text{comp}(2)=0, \quad  \text{comp}(3)=1, \quad  \ldots
@f]
@f[
  \text{base}(0)=0, \quad  \text{base}(1)=0, \quad  \text{base}(2)=1, \quad  \text{base}(3)=1, \quad  \ldots
@f]

In all but very rare cases, you will not need to know which shape function
$\varphi_{\text{base}(i)}$ of the scalar element belongs to a shape function $\Phi_i$
of the vector element. Let us therefore define
@f[
  \phi_i = \varphi_{\text{base}(i)}
@f]
by which we can write the vector shape function as
@f[
  \Phi_i({\mathbf x}) = \phi_{i}({\mathbf x})\ {\mathbf e}_{\text{comp}(i)}.
@f]
You can now safely forget about the function $\text{base}(i)$, at least for the rest
of this example program.

Now using this vector shape functions, we can write the discrete finite
element solution as
@f[
  {\mathbf u}_h({\mathbf x}) =
  \sum_i \Phi_i({\mathbf x})\ U_i
@f]
with scalar coefficients $U_i$. If we define an analog function ${\mathbf v}_h$ as
test function, we can write the discrete problem as follows: Find coefficients
$U_i$ such that
@f[
  a({\mathbf u}_h, {\mathbf v}_h) = ({\mathbf f}, {\mathbf v}_h)
  \qquad
  \forall {\mathbf v}_h.
@f]

If we insert the definition of the bilinear form and the representation of
${\mathbf u}_h$ and ${\mathbf v}_h$ into this formula:
@f{eqnarray*}{
  \sum_{i,j}
    U_i V_j
  \sum_{k,l}
  \left\{
  \left(
    \lambda \partial_l (\Phi_i)_l, \partial_k (\Phi_j)_k
  \right)_\Omega
  +
  \left(
    \mu \partial_l (\Phi_i)_k, \partial_l (\Phi_j)_k
  \right)_\Omega
  +
  \left(
    \mu \partial_l (\Phi_i)_k, \partial_k (\Phi_j)_l
  \right)_\Omega
  \right\}
\\
=
  \sum_j V_j
  \sum_l
  \left(
    f_l,
    (\Phi_j)_l
  \right)_\Omega.
@f}
We note that here and in the following, the indices $k,l$ run over spatial
directions, i.e. $0\le k,l < d$, and that indices $i,j$ run over degrees
of freedom.

The local @ref GlossStiffnessMatrix "stiffness matrix" on cell $K$ therefore has the following entries:
@f[
  A^K_{ij}
  =
  \sum_{k,l}
  \left\{
  \left(
    \lambda \partial_l (\Phi_i)_l, \partial_k (\Phi_j)_k
  \right)_K
  +
  \left(
    \mu \partial_l (\Phi_i)_k, \partial_l (\Phi_j)_k
  \right)_K
  +
  \left(
    \mu \partial_l (\Phi_i)_k, \partial_k (\Phi_j)_l
  \right)_K
  \right\},
@f]
where $i,j$ now are local degrees of freedom and therefore $0\le i,j < N$.
In these formulas, we always take some component of the vector shape functions
$\Phi_i$, which are of course given as follows (see their definition):
@f[
  (\Phi_i)_l = \phi_i \delta_{l,\text{comp}(i)},
@f]
with the Kronecker symbol $\delta_{nm}$. Due to this, we can delete some of
the sums over $k$ and $l$:
@f{eqnarray*}{
  A^K_{ij}
  &=&
  \sum_{k,l}
  \Bigl\{
  \left(
    \lambda \partial_l \phi_i\ \delta_{l,\text{comp}(i)},
            \partial_k \phi_j\ \delta_{k,\text{comp}(j)}
  \right)_K
\\
  &\qquad\qquad& +
  \left(
    \mu \partial_l \phi_i\ \delta_{k,\text{comp}(i)},
        \partial_l \phi_j\ \delta_{k,\text{comp}(j)}
  \right)_K
  +
  \left(
    \mu \partial_l \phi_i\ \delta_{k,\text{comp}(i)},
        \partial_k \phi_j\ \delta_{l,\text{comp}(j)}
  \right)_K
  \Bigr\}
\\
  &=&
  \left(
    \lambda \partial_{\text{comp}(i)} \phi_i,
            \partial_{\text{comp}(j)} \phi_j
  \right)_K
  +
  \sum_l
  \left(
    \mu \partial_l \phi_i,
        \partial_l \phi_j
  \right)_K
  \ \delta_{\text{comp}(i),\text{comp}(j)}
  +
  \left(
    \mu \partial_{\text{comp}(j)} \phi_i,
        \partial_{\text{comp}(i)} \phi_j
  \right)_K
\\
  &=&
  \left(
    \lambda \partial_{\text{comp}(i)} \phi_i,
            \partial_{\text{comp}(j)} \phi_j
  \right)_K
  +
  \left(
    \mu \nabla \phi_i,
        \nabla \phi_j
  \right)_K
  \ \delta_{\text{comp}(i),\text{comp}(j)}
  +
  \left(
    \mu \partial_{\text{comp}(j)} \phi_i,
        \partial_{\text{comp}(i)} \phi_j
  \right)_K.
@f}

Likewise, the contribution of cell $K$ to the right hand side vector is
@f{eqnarray*}{
  f^K_j
  &=&
  \sum_l
  \left(
    f_l,
    (\Phi_j)_l
  \right)_K
\\
  &=&
  \sum_l
  \left(
    f_l,
    \phi_j \delta_{l,\text{comp}(j)}
  \right)_K
\\
  &=&
  \left(
    f_{\text{comp}(j)},
    \phi_j
  \right)_K.
@f}

This is the form in which we will implement the local stiffness matrix and
right hand side vectors.

As a final note: in the step-17 example program, we will
revisit the elastic problem laid out here, and will show how to solve it in
%parallel on a cluster of computers. The resulting program will thus be able to
solve this problem to significantly higher accuracy, and more efficiently if
this is required. In addition, in step-20, @ref step_21
"step-21", as well as a few other of the later tutorial programs, we will
revisit some vector-valued problems and show a few techniques that may make it
simpler to actually go through all the stuff shown above, with
FiniteElement::system_to_component_index etc.
