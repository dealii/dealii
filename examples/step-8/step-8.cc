  // we will compose the vector-valued element of <code>FE_Q(1)</code>
  // objects, as shown below in the constructor of this class.

  // @sect3{Right hand side values}

  // Before going over to the implementation of the main class, we declare and
  // define the class which describes the right hand side. This time, the
  // right hand side is vector-valued, as is the solution, so we will describe
  // the changes required for this in some more detail.
  //
  // The first thing is that vector-valued functions have to have a
  // constructor, since they need to pass down to the base class of how many
  // components the function consists. The default value in the constructor of
  // the base class is one (i.e.: a scalar function), which is why we did not
  // need not define a constructor for the scalar function used in previous
  // programs.
  template <int dim>
  class RightHandSide :  public Function<dim>
  {
  public:
    RightHandSide ();

    // The next change is that we want a replacement for the
    // <code>value</code> function of the previous examples. There, a second
    // parameter <code>component</code> was given, which denoted which
    // component was requested. Here, we implement a function that returns the
    // whole vector of values at the given place at once, in the second
    // argument of the function. The obvious name for such a replacement
    // function is <code>vector_value</code>.
    //
    // Secondly, in analogy to the <code>value_list</code> function, there is
    // a function <code>vector_value_list</code>, which returns the values of
    // the vector-valued function at several points at once:
    virtual void vector_value (const Point<dim> &p,
                               Vector<double>   &values) const;

    virtual void vector_value_list (const std::vector<Point<dim> > &points,
                                    std::vector<Vector<double> >   &value_list) const;
  };


  // This is the constructor of the right hand side class. As said above, it
  // only passes down to the base class the number of components, which is
  // <code>dim</code> in the present case (one force component in each of the
  // <code>dim</code> space directions).
  //
  // Some people would have moved the definition of such a short function
  // right into the class declaration. We do not do that, as a matter of
  // style: the deal.II style guides require that class declarations contain
  // only declarations, and that definitions are always to be found
  // outside. This is, obviously, as much as matter of taste as indentation,
  // but we try to be consistent in this direction.
  template <int dim>
  RightHandSide<dim>::RightHandSide ()
    :
    Function<dim> (dim)
  {}


  // Next the function that returns the whole vector of values at the point
  // <code>p</code> at once.
  //
  // To prevent cases where the return vector has not previously been set to
  // the right size we test for this case and otherwise throw an exception at
  // the beginning of the function. Note that enforcing that output arguments
  // already have the correct size is a convention in deal.II, and enforced
  // almost everywhere. The reason is that we would otherwise have to check at
  // the beginning of the function and possibly change the size of the output
  // vector. This is expensive, and would almost always be unnecessary (the
  // first call to the function would set the vector to the right size, and
  // subsequent calls would only have to do redundant checks). In addition,
  // checking and possibly resizing the vector is an operation that can not be
  // removed if we can't rely on the assumption that the vector already has
  // the correct size; this is in contract to the <code>Assert</code> call
  // that is completely removed if the program is compiled in optimized mode.
  //
  // Likewise, if by some accident someone tried to compile and run the
  // program in only one space dimension (in which the elastic equations do
  // not make much sense since they reduce to the ordinary Laplace equation),
  // we terminate the program in the second assertion. The program will work
  // just fine in 3d, however.

    // The rest of the function implements computing force values. We will use
    // a constant (unit) force in x-direction located in two little circles
    // (or spheres, in 3d) around points (0.5,0) and (-0.5,0), and y-force in
    // an area around the origin; in 3d, the z-component of these centers is
    // zero as well.
    //
    // For this, let us first define two objects that denote the centers of
    // these areas. Note that upon construction of the <code>Point</code>
    // objects, all components are set to zero.
    Point<dim> point_1, point_2;
    point_1(0) = 0.5;
    point_2(0) = -0.5;

    // If now the point <code>p</code> is in a circle (sphere) of radius 0.2
    // around one of these points, then set the force in x-direction to one,
    // otherwise to zero:
    if (((p-point_1).norm_square() < 0.2*0.2) ||
        ((p-point_2).norm_square() < 0.2*0.2))
      values(0) = 1;
    else
      values(0) = 0;

    if (p.norm_square() < 0.2*0.2)
      values(1) = 1;
    else
      values(1) = 0;
  }



  // Now, this is the function of the right hand side class that returns the
  // values at several points at once. The function starts out with checking
  // that the number of input and output arguments is equal (the sizes of the
  // individual output vectors will be checked in the function that we call
  // further down below). Next, we define an abbreviation for the number of
  // points which we shall work on, to make some things simpler below.
  template <int dim>
  void RightHandSide<dim>::vector_value_list (const std::vector<Point<dim> > &points,
                                              std::vector<Vector<double> >   &value_list) const
  {
    Assert (value_list.size() == points.size(),
            ExcDimensionMismatch (value_list.size(), points.size()));

    const unsigned int n_points = points.size();

    // Finally we treat each of the points. In one of the previous examples,
    // we have explained why the
    // <code>value_list</code>/<code>vector_value_list</code> function had
    // been introduced: to prevent us from calling virtual functions too
    // frequently. On the other hand, we now need to implement the same
    // function twice, which can lead to confusion if one function is changed
    // but the other is not.
    //
    // We can prevent this situation by calling
    // <code>RightHandSide::vector_value</code> on each point in the input
    // list. Note that by giving the full name of the function, including the
    // class name, we instruct the compiler to explicitly call this function,
    // and not to use the virtual function call mechanism that would be used
    // if we had just called <code>vector_value</code>. This is important,
    // since the compiler generally can't make any assumptions which function
    // is called when using virtual functions, and it therefore can't inline
    // the called function into the site of the call. On the contrary, here we
    // give the fully qualified name, which bypasses the virtual function
    // call, and consequently the compiler knows exactly which function is
    // called and will inline above function into the present location. (Note
    // that we have declared the <code>vector_value</code> function above
    // <code>inline</code>, though modern compilers are also able to inline
    // functions even if they have not been declared as inline).
    //
    // It is worth noting why we go to such length explaining what we
    // do. Using this construct, we manage to avoid any inconsistency: if we
    // want to change the right hand side function, it would be difficult to
    // always remember that we always have to change two functions in the same
    // way. Using this forwarding mechanism, we only have to change a single
    // place (the <code>vector_value</code> function), and the second place
    // (the <code>vector_value_list</code> function) will always be consistent
    // with it. At the same time, using virtual function call bypassing, the
    // code is no less efficient than if we had written it twice in the first
    // place:
    for (unsigned int p=0; p<n_points; ++p)
      RightHandSide<dim>::vector_value (points[p],
                                        value_list[p]);

  // element so that each of its vector components consists of the shape
  // functions of a scalar element). Of course, the number of scalar finite
  // elements we would like to stack together equals the number of components
  // the solution function has, which is <code>dim</code> since we consider
  // displacement in each space direction. The <code>FESystem</code> class can

  // The <code>run</code> function does the same things as in step-6, for
  // example. This time, we use the square [-1,1]^d as domain, and we refine
  // it twice globally before starting the first iteration.
  //
  // The reason for refining twice is a bit accidental: we use the QGauss quadrature
  // formula with two points in each direction for integration of the right
  // hand side; that means that there are four quadrature points on each cell
  // (in 2D). If we only refine the initial grid once globally, then there
  // will be only four quadrature points in each direction on the
  // domain. However, the right hand side function was chosen to be rather
  // localized and in that case, by pure chance, it happens that all quadrature
  // points lie at points where the the right hand side function is zero (in
  // mathematical terms, the quadrature points happen to be at points outside
  // the <i>support</i> of the right hand side function). The right hand side
  // vector computed with quadrature will then contain only zeroes (even though
  // it would of course be nonzero if we had computed the right hand side vector
  // exactly using the integral) and the solution of the system of
  // equations is the zero vector, i.e., a finite element function that is zero
  // everywhere. In a sense, we
  // should not be surprised that this is happening since we have chosen
  // an initial grid that is totally unsuitable for the problem at hand.
  //
  // The unfortunate thing is that if the discrete solution is constant, then
  // the error indicators computed by the <code>KellyErrorEstimator</code>
  // class are zero for each cell as well, and the call to
  // <code>refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number</code> on the
  // <code>triangulation</code> object will not flag any cells for refinement
  // (why should it if the indicated error is zero for each cell?). The grid
  // in the next iteration will therefore consist of four cells only as well,
  // and the same problem occurs again.
  //
  // The conclusion needs to be: while of course we will not choose the
  // initial grid to be well-suited for the accurate solution of the problem,
  // we must at least choose it such that it has the chance to capture the
  // important features of the solution. In this case, it needs to be able
  // to see the right hand side. Thus, we refine twice globally. (Any larger
  // number of global refinement steps would of course also work.)
