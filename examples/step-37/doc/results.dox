<h3>Program output</h3>

Since this example solves the same problem as step-5 (except for
a different coefficient), there is little to say about the
solution. We show a picture anyway, illustrating the size of the
solution through both isocontours and volume rendering:

Of more interest is to evaluate some aspects of the multigrid solver.
When we run this program in 2D for quadratic ($Q_2$) elements, we get the
following output (when run on one core in release mode):

As in step-16, we see that the number of CG iterations remains constant with
increasing number of degrees of freedom. A constant number of iterations
(together with optimal computational properties) means that the computing time
approximately quadruples as the problem size quadruples from one cycle to the
next. The code is also very efficient in terms of storage. Around 2-4 million
degrees of freedom fit into 1 GB of memory, see also the MPI results below. An
interesting fact is that solving one linear system is cheaper than the setup,
despite not building a matrix (approximately half of which is spent in the
DoFHandler::distribute_dofs() and DoFHandler::distribute_mg_dofs()
calls). This shows the high efficiency of this approach, but also that the
deal.II data structures are quite expensive to set up and the setup cost must
be amortized over several system solves.

Not much changes if we run the program in three spatial dimensions. Since we
use uniform mesh refinement, we get eight times as many elements and
approximately eight times as many degrees of freedom with each cycle:

Since it is so easy, we look at what happens if we increase the polynomial
degree. When selecting the degree as four in 3D, i.e., on $\mathcal Q_4$
elements, by changing the line <code>const unsigned int
degree_finite_element=4;</code> at the top of the program, we get the
following program output:

Since $\mathcal Q_4$ elements on a certain mesh correspond to $\mathcal Q_2$
elements on half the mesh size, we can compare the run time at cycle 4 with
fourth degree polynomials with cycle 5 using quadratic polynomials, both at
2.1 million degrees of freedom. The surprising effect is that the solver for
$\mathcal Q_4$ element is actually slightly faster than for the quadratic
case, despite using one more linear iteration. The effect that higher-degree
polynomials are similarly fast or even faster than lower degree ones is one of
the main strengths of matrix-free operator evaluation through sum
factorization, see the <a
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compfluid.2012.04.012">matrix-free
paper</a>. This is fundamentally different to matrix-based methods that get
more expensive per unknown as the polynomial degree increases and the coupling
gets denser.

In addition, also the setup gets a bit cheaper for higher order, which is
because fewer elements need to be set up.

Finally, let us look at the timings with degree 8, which corresponds to
another round of mesh refinement in the lower order methods:

Here, the initialization seems considerably slower than before, which is
mainly due to the computation of the diagonal of the matrix, which actually
computes a 729 x 729 matrix on each cell and throws away everything but the
diagonal. The solver times, however, are again very close to the quartic case,
showing that the linear increase with the polynomial degree that is
theoretically expected is almost completely offset by better computational
characteristics and the fact that higher order methods have a smaller share of
degrees of freedom living on several cells that add to the evaluation
complexity.

<h3>Comparison with a sparse matrix</h3>

In order to understand the capabilities of the matrix-free implementation, we
compare the performance of the 3d example above with a sparse matrix
implementation based on TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix by measuring both the
computation times for the initialization of the problem (distribute DoFs,
setup and assemble matrices, setup multigrid structures) and the actual
solution for the matrix-free variant and the variant based on sparse
matrices. We base the preconditioner on float numbers and the actual matrix
and vectors on double numbers, as shown above. Tests are run on an Intel Core
i7-5500U notebook processor (two cores and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX</a>
support, i.e., four operations on doubles can be done with one CPU
instruction, which is heavily used in FEEvaluation), optimized mode, and two
MPI ranks.

The table clearly shows that the matrix-free implementation is more than twice
as fast for the solver, and more than six times as fast when it comes to
initialization costs. As the problem size is made a factor 8 larger, we note
that the times usually go up by a factor eight, too (as the solver iterations
are constant at six). The main deviation is in the sparse matrix between 5k
and 36k degrees of freedom, where the time increases by a factor 12. This is
the threshold where the (L3) cache in the processor can no longer hold all
data necessary for the matrix-vector products and all matrix elements must be
fetched from main memory.

Of course, this picture does not necessarily translate to all cases, as there
are problems where knowledge of matrix entries enables much better solvers (as
happens when the coefficient is varying more strongly than in the above
example). Moreover, it also depends on the computer system. The present system
has good memory performance, so sparse matrices perform comparably
well. Nonetheless, the matrix-free implementation gives a nice speedup already
for the <i>Q</i><sub>2</sub> elements used in this example. This becomes
particularly apparent for time-dependent or nonlinear problems where sparse
matrices would need to be reassembled over and over again, which becomes much
easier with this class. And of course, thanks to the better complexity of the
products, the method gains increasingly larger advantages when the order of the
elements increases (the matrix-free implementation has costs
4<i>d</i><sup>2</sup><i>p</i> per degree of freedom, compared to
2<i>p<sup>d</sup></i> for the sparse matrix, so it will win anyway for order 4
and higher in 3d).

<h3> Results for large-scale parallel computations on SuperMUC</h3>

As explained in the introduction and the in-code comments, this program can be
run in parallel with MPI. It turns out that geometric multigrid schemes work
really well and can scale to very large machines. To the authors' knowledge,
the geometric multigrid results shown here are the largest computations done
with deal.II as of late 2016, run on up to 147,456 cores of the <a
href="https://www.lrz.de/services/compute/supermuc/systemdescription/">complete
SuperMUC Phase 1</a>. The ingredients for scalability beyond 1000 cores are
that no data structure that depends on the global problem size is held in its
entirety on a single processor and that the communication is not too frequent
in order not to run into latency issues of the network.  For PDEs solved with
iterative solvers, the communication latency is often the limiting factor,
rather than the throughput of the network. For the example of the SuperMUC
system, the point-to-point latency between two processors is between 1e-6 and
1e-5 seconds, depending on the proximity in the MPI network. The matrix-vector
products with @p LaplaceOperator from this class involves several
point-to-point communication steps, interleaved with computations on each
core. The resulting latency of a matrix-vector product is around 1e-4
seconds. Global communication, for example an @p MPI_Allreduce operation that
accumulates the sum of a single number per rank over all ranks in the MPI
network, has a latency of 1e-4 seconds. The multigrid V-cycle used in this
program is also a form of global communication. Think about the coarse grid
solve that happens on a single processor: It accumulates the contributions
from all processors before it starts. When completed, the coarse grid solution
is transferred to finer levels, where more and more processors help in
smoothing until the fine grid. Essentially, this is a tree-like pattern over
the processors in the network and controlled by the mesh. As opposed to the
@p MPI_Allreduce operations where the tree in the reduction is optimized to the
actual links in the MPI network, the multigrid V-cycle does this according to
the partitioning of the mesh. Thus, we cannot expect the same
optimality. Furthermore, the multigrid cycle is not simply a walk up and down
the refinement tree, but also communication on each level when doing the
smoothing. In other words, the global communication in multigrid is more
challenging and related to the mesh that provides less optimization
opportunities. The measured latency of the V-cycle is between 6e-3 and 2e-2
seconds, i.e., the same as 60 to 200 MPI_Allreduce operations.

The following figure shows a scaling experiments on $\mathcal Q_3$
elements. Along the lines, the problem size is held constant as the number of
cores is increasing. When doubling the number of cores, one expects a halving
of the computational time, indicated by the dotted gray lines. The results
show that the implementation shows almost ideal behavior until an absolute
time of around 0.1 seconds is reached. The solver tolerances have been set
such that the solver performs five iterations. This way of plotting data is
the <b>strong scaling</b> of the algorithm. As we go to very large core
counts, the curves flatten out a bit earlier, which is because of the
communication network in SuperMUC where communication between processors
farther away is slightly slower.

<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-37.scaling_strong.png" alt="">

In addition, the plot also contains results for <b>weak scaling</b> that lists
how the algorithm behaves as both the number of processor cores and elements
is increased at the same pace. In this situation, we expect that the compute
time remains constant. Algorithmically, the number of CG iterations is
constant at 5, so we are good from that end. The lines in the plot are
arranged such that the top left point in each data series represents the same
size per processor, namely 131,072 elements (or approximately 3.5 million
degrees of freedom per core). The gray lines indicating ideal strong scaling
are by the same factor of 8 apart. The results show again that the scaling is
almost ideal. The parallel efficiency when going from 288 cores to 147,456
cores is at around 75% for a local problem size of 750,000 degrees of freedom
per core which takes 1.0s on 288 cores, 1.03s on 2304 cores, 1.19s on 18k
cores, and 1.35s on 147k cores. The algorithms also reach a very high
utilization of the processor. The largest computation on 147k cores reaches
around 1.7 PFLOPs/s on SuperMUC out of an arithmetic peak of 3.2 PFLOPs/s. For
an iterative PDE solver, this is a very high number and significantly more is
often only reached for dense linear algebra. Sparse linear algebra is limited
to a tenth of this value.

As mentioned in the introduction, the matrix-free method reduces the memory
consumption of the data structures. Besides the higher performance due to less
memory transfer, the algorithms also allow for very large problems to fit into
memory. The figure below shows the computational time as we increase the
problem size until an upper limit where the computation exhausts memory. We do
this for 1k cores, 8k cores, and 65k cores and see that the problem size can
be varied over almost two orders of magnitude with ideal scaling. The largest
computation shown in this picture involves 292 billion ($2.92 \cdot 10^{11}$)
degrees of freedom. On a DG computation of 147k cores, the above algorithms
were also run involving up to 549 billion (2^39) DoFs.

<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-37.scaling_size.png" alt="">

Finally, we note that while performing the tests on the large-scale system
shown above, improvements of the multigrid algorithms in deal.II have been
developed. The original version contained the sub-optimal code based on
MGSmootherPrecondition where some MPI_Allreduce commands (checking whether
all vector entries are zero) were done on each smoothing
operation on each level, which only became apparent on 65k cores and
more. However, the following picture shows that the improvement already pay
off on a smaller scale, here shown on computations on up to 14,336 cores for
$\mathcal Q_5$ elements:

<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-37.scaling_oldnew.png" alt="">


<h3> Adaptivity</h3>

As explained in the code, the algorithm presented here is prepared to run on
adaptively refined meshes. If only part of the mesh is refined, the multigrid
cycle will run with local smoothing and impose Dirichlet conditions along the
interfaces which differ in refinement level for smoothing through the
MatrixFreeOperators::Base class. Due to the way the degrees of freedom are
distributed over levels, relating the owner of the level cells to the owner of
the first descendant active cell, there can be an imbalance between different
processors in MPI, which limits scalability by a factor of around two to five.

<h3> Possibilities for extensions</h3>

<h4> Kelly error estimator </h4>

As mentioned above the code is ready for locally adaptive h-refinement.
For the Poisson equation one can employ the Kelly error indicator,
implemented in the KellyErrorEstimator class. However one needs to be careful
with the ghost indices of parallel vectors.
In order to evaluate the jump terms in the error indicator, each MPI process
needs to know locally relevant DoFs.
However MatrixFree::initialize_dof_vector() function initializes the vector only with
some locally relevant DoFs.
The ghost indices made available in the vector are a tight set of only those indices
that are touched in the cell integrals (including constraint resolution).
This choice has performance reasons, because sending all locally relevant degrees
of freedom would be too expensive compared to the matrix-vector product.
Consequently the solution vector as-is is
not suitable for the KellyErrorEstimator class.
The trick is to change the ghost part of the partition, for example using a
temporary vector and LinearAlgebra::distributed::Vector::copy_locally_owned_data_from()
as shown below.

@code
IndexSet locally_relevant_dofs;
DoFTools::extract_locally_relevant_dofs(dof_handler, locally_relevant_dofs);
LinearAlgebra::distributed::Vector<double> copy_vec(solution);
solution.reinit(dof_handler.locally_owned_dofs(),
                locally_relevant_dofs,
                triangulation.get_communicator());
solution.copy_locally_owned_data_from(copy_vec);
constraints.distribute(solution);
solution.update_ghost_values();
@endcode

<h4> Shared-memory parallelization</h4>

This program is parallelized with MPI only. As an alternative, the MatrixFree
loop can also be issued in hybrid mode, for example by using MPI parallelizing
over the nodes of a cluster and with threads through Intel TBB within the
shared memory region of one node. To use this, one would need to both set the
number of threads in the MPI_InitFinalize data structure in the main function,
and set the MatrixFree::AdditionalData::tasks_parallel_scheme to
partition_color to actually do the loop in parallel. This use case is
discussed in step-48.

<h4> Inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions </h4>

The presented program assumes homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. When
going to non-homogeneous conditions, the situation is a bit more intricate. To
understand how to implement such a setting, let us first recall how these
arise in the mathematical formulation and how they are implemented in a
matrix-based variant. In essence, an inhomogeneous Dirichlet condition sets
some of the nodal values in the solution to given values rather than
determining them through the variational principles,
@f{eqnarray*}
u_h(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i\in \mathcal N} \varphi_i(\mathbf{x}) u_i =
\sum_{i\in \mathcal N \setminus \mathcal N_D} \varphi_i(\mathbf{x}) u_i +
\sum_{i\in \mathcal N_D} \varphi_i(\mathbf{x}) g_i,
@f}
where $u_i$ denotes the nodal values of the solution and $\mathcal N$ denotes
the set of all nodes. The set $\mathcal N_D\subset \mathcal N$ is the subset
of the nodes that are subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions where the
solution is forced to equal $u_i = g_i = g(\mathbf{x}_i)$ as the interpolation
of boundary values on the Dirichlet-constrained node points $i\in \mathcal
N_D$. We then insert this solution
representation into the weak form, e.g. the Laplacian shown above, and move
the known quantities to the right hand side:
@f{eqnarray*}
(\nabla \varphi_i, \nabla u_h)_\Omega &=& (\varphi_i, f)_\Omega \quad \Rightarrow \\
\sum_{j\in \mathcal N \setminus \mathcal N_D}(\nabla \varphi_i,\nabla \varphi_j)_\Omega \, u_j &=&
(\varphi_i, f)_\Omega
-\sum_{j\in \mathcal N_D} (\nabla \varphi_i,\nabla\varphi_j)_\Omega\, g_j.
@f}
In this formula, the equations are tested for all basis functions $\varphi_i$
with $i\in N \setminus \mathcal N_D$ that are not related to the nodes
constrained by Dirichlet conditions.

In the implementation in deal.II, the integrals $(\nabla \varphi_i,\nabla \varphi_j)_\Omega$
on the right hand side are already contained in the local matrix contributions
we assemble on each cell. When using
AffineConstraints::distribute_local_to_global() as first described in the
step-6 and step-7 tutorial programs, we can account for the contribution of
inhomogeneous constraints <i>j</i> by multiplying the columns <i>j</i> and
rows <i>i</i> of the local matrix according to the integrals $(\varphi_i,
\varphi_j)_\Omega$ by the inhomogeneities and subtracting the resulting from
the position <i>i</i> in the global right-hand-side vector, see also the @ref
constraints module. In essence, we use some of the integrals that get
eliminated from the left hand side of the equation to finalize the right hand
side contribution. Similar mathematics are also involved when first writing
all entries into a left hand side matrix and then eliminating matrix rows and
columns by MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values().

In principle, the components that belong to the constrained degrees of freedom
could be eliminated from the linear system because they do not carry any
information. In practice, in deal.II we always keep the size of the linear
system the same to avoid handling two different numbering systems and avoid
confusion about the two different index sets. In order to ensure that the
linear system does not get singular when not adding anything to constrained
rows, we then add dummy entries to the matrix diagonal that are otherwise
unrelated to the real entries.

In a matrix-free method, we need to take a different approach, since the @p
LaplaceOperator class represents the matrix-vector product of a
<b>homogeneous</b> operator (the left-hand side of the last formula).  It does
not matter whether the AffineConstraints object passed to the
MatrixFree::reinit() contains inhomogeneous constraints or not, the
MatrixFree::cell_loop() call will only resolve the homogeneous part of the
constraints as long as it represents a <b>linear</b> operator.

In our matrix-free code, the right hand side computation where the
contribution of inhomogeneous conditions ends up is completely decoupled from
the matrix operator and handled by a different function above. Thus, we need
to explicitly generate the data that enters the right hand side rather than
using a byproduct of the matrix assembly. Since we already know how to apply
the operator on a vector, we could try to use those facilities for a vector
where we only set the Dirichlet values:
@code
  // interpolate boundary values on vector solution
  std::map<types::global_dof_index, double> boundary_values;
  VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values(mapping,
                                           dof_handler,
                                           0,
                                           BoundaryValueFunction<dim>(),
                                           boundary_values);
  for (const std::pair<const types::global_dof_index, double> &pair : boundary_values)
    if (solution.locally_owned_elements().is_element(pair.first))
      solution(pair.first) = pair.second;
@endcode
or, equivalently, if we already had filled the inhomogeneous constraints into
an AffineConstraints object,
@code
  solution = 0;
  constraints.distribute(solution);
@endcode

We could then pass the vector @p solution to the @p
LaplaceOperator::vmult_add() function and add the new contribution to the @p
system_rhs vector that gets filled in the @p LaplaceProblem::assemble_rhs()
function. However, this idea does not work because the
FEEvaluation::read_dof_values() call used inside the vmult() functions assumes
homogeneous values on all constraints (otherwise the operator would not be a
linear operator but an affine one). To also retrieve the values of the
inhomogeneities, we could select one of two following strategies.

<h5> Use FEEvaluation::read_dof_values_plain() to avoid resolving constraints </h5>

The class FEEvaluation has a facility that addresses precisely this
requirement: For non-homogeneous Dirichlet values, we do want to skip the
implicit imposition of homogeneous (Dirichlet) constraints upon reading the
data from the vector @p solution. For example, we could extend the @p
LaplaceProblem::assemble_rhs() function to deal with inhomogeneous Dirichlet
values as follows, assuming the Dirichlet values have been interpolated into
the object @p constraints:
@code
template <int dim>
void LaplaceProblem<dim>::assemble_rhs()
{
  solution = 0;
  constraints.distribute(solution);
  solution.update_ghost_values();
  system_rhs = 0;

  const Table<2, VectorizedArray<double>> &coefficient = system_matrix.get_coefficient();
  FEEvaluation<dim, degree_finite_element> phi(*system_matrix.get_matrix_free());
  for (unsigned int cell = 0;
       cell < system_matrix.get_matrix_free()->n_macro_cells();
       ++cell)
    {
      phi.reinit(cell);
      phi.read_dof_values_plain(solution);
      phi.evaluate(false, true);
      for (unsigned int q = 0; q < phi.n_q_points; ++q)
        {
          phi.submit_gradient(-coefficient(cell, q) * phi.get_gradient(q), q);
          phi.submit_value(make_vectorized_array<double>(1.0), q);
        }
      phi.integrate(true, true);
      phi.distribute_local_to_global(system_rhs);
    }
  system_rhs.compress(VectorOperation::add);
}
@endcode

In this code, we replaced the FEEvaluation::read_dof_values() function for the
tentative solution vector by FEEvaluation::read_dof_values_plain() that
ignores all constraints. Due to this setup, we must make sure that other
constraints, e.g. by hanging nodes, are correctly distributed to the input
vector already as they are not resolved as in
FEEvaluation::read_dof_values_plain(). Inside the loop, we then evaluate the
Laplacian and repeat the second derivative call with
FEEvaluation::submit_gradient() from the @p LaplaceOperator class, but with the
sign switched since we wanted to subtract the contribution of Dirichlet
conditions on the right hand side vector according to the formula above. When
we invoke the FEEvaluation::integrate() call, we then set both arguments
regarding the value slot and first derivative slot to true to account for both
terms added in the loop over quadrature points. Once the right hand side is
assembled, we then go on to solving the linear system for the homogeneous
problem, say involving a variable @p solution_update. After solving, we can
add @p solution_update to the @p solution vector that contains the final
(inhomogeneous) solution.

Note that the negative sign for the Laplacian alongside with a positive sign
for the forcing that we needed to build the right hand side is a more general
concept: We have implemented nothing else than Newton's method for nonlinear
equations, but applied to a linear system. We have used an initial guess for
the variable @p solution in terms of the Dirichlet boundary conditions and
computed a residual $r = f - Au_0$. The linear system was then solved as
$\Delta u = A^{-1} (f-Au)$ and we finally computed $u = u_0 + \Delta u$. For a
linear system, we obviously reach the exact solution after a single
iteration. If we wanted to extend the code to a nonlinear problem, we would
rename the @p assemble_rhs() function into a more descriptive name like @p
assemble_residual() that computes the (weak) form of the residual, whereas the
@p LaplaceOperator::apply_add() function would get the linearization of the
residual with respect to the solution variable.

<h5> Use LaplaceOperator with a second AffineConstraints object without Dirichlet conditions </h5>

A second alternative to get the right hand side that re-uses the @p
LaplaceOperator::apply_add() function is to instead add a second LaplaceOperator
that skips Dirichlet constraints. To do this, we initialize a second MatrixFree
object which does not have any boundary value constraints. This @p matrix_free
object is then passed to a @p LaplaceOperator class instance @p
inhomogeneous_operator that is only used to create the right hand side:
@code
template <int dim>
void LaplaceProblem<dim>::assemble_rhs()
{
  system_rhs = 0;
  AffineConstraints<double> no_constraints;
  no_constraints.close();
  LaplaceOperator<dim, degree_finite_element, double> inhomogeneous_operator;

  typename MatrixFree<dim, double>::AdditionalData additional_data;
  additional_data.mapping_update_flags =
    (update_gradients | update_JxW_values | update_quadrature_points);
  std::shared_ptr<MatrixFree<dim, double>> matrix_free(
    new MatrixFree<dim, double>());
  matrix_free->reinit(dof_handler,
                      no_constraints,
                      QGauss<1>(fe.degree + 1),
                      additional_data);
  inhomogeneous_operator.initialize(matrix_free);

  solution = 0.0;
  constraints.distribute(solution);
  inhomogeneous_operator.evaluate_coefficient(Coefficient<dim>());
  inhomogeneous_operator.vmult(system_rhs, solution);
  system_rhs *= -1.0;

  FEEvaluation<dim, degree_finite_element> phi(
    *inhomogeneous_operator.get_matrix_free());
  for (unsigned int cell = 0;
       cell < inhomogeneous_operator.get_matrix_free()->n_macro_cells();
       ++cell)
    {
      phi.reinit(cell);
      for (unsigned int q = 0; q < phi.n_q_points; ++q)
        phi.submit_value(make_vectorized_array<double>(1.0), q);
      phi.integrate(true, false);
      phi.distribute_local_to_global(system_rhs);
    }
  system_rhs.compress(VectorOperation::add);
}
@endcode

A more sophisticated implementation of this technique could reuse the original
MatrixFree object. This can be done by initializing the MatrixFree object with
multiple blocks, where each block corresponds to a different AffineConstraints
object. Doing this would require making substantial modifications to the
LaplaceOperator class, but the MatrixFreeOperators::LaplaceOperator class that
comes with the library can do this. See the discussion on blocks in
MatrixFreeOperators::Base for more information on how to set up blocks.
