  // @sect3{Matrix-free implementation}

  // The following class, called <code>LaplaceOperator</code>, implements the
  // differential operator. For all practical purposes, it is a matrix, i.e.,
  // you can ask it for its size (member functions <code>m(), n()</code>) and
  // you can apply it to a vector (the <code>vmult()</code> function). The
  // difference to a real matrix of course lies in the fact that this class
  // does not actually store the <i>elements</i> of the matrix, but only knows
  // how to compute the action of the operator when applied to a vector.
  //
  // The infrastructure describing the matrix size, the initialization from a
  // MatrixFree object, and the various interfaces to matrix-vector products
  // through vmult() and Tvmult() methods, is provided by the class
  // MatrixFreeOperator::Base from which this class derives. The
  // LaplaceOperator class defined here only has to provide a few interfaces,
  // namely the actual action of the operator through the apply_add() method
  // that gets used in the vmult() functions, and a method to compute the
  // diagonal entries of the underlying matrix. We need the diagonal for the
  // definition of the multigrid smoother. Since we consider a problem with
  // variable coefficient, we further implement a method that can fill the
  // coefficient values.
  //
  // Note that the file <code>include/deal.II/matrix_free/operators.h</code>
  // already contains an implementation of the Laplacian through the class
  // MatrixFreeOperators::LaplaceOperator. For educational purposes, the
  // operator is re-implemented in this tutorial program, explaining the
  // ingredients and concepts used there.
  //
  // This program makes use of the data cache for finite element operator
  // application that is integrated in deal.II. This data cache class is
  // called MatrixFree. It contains mapping information (Jacobians) and index
  // relations between local and global degrees of freedom. It also contains
  // constraints like the ones from hanging nodes or Dirichlet boundary
  // conditions. Moreover, it can issue a loop over all cells in %parallel,
  // making sure that only cells are worked on that do not share any degree of
  // freedom (this makes the loop thread-safe when writing into destination
  // vectors). This is a more advanced strategy compared to the WorkStream
  // class described in the @ref threads module. Of course, to not destroy
  // thread-safety, we have to be careful when writing into class-global
  // structures.
  //
  // The class implementing the Laplace operator has three template arguments,
  // one for the dimension (as many deal.II classes carry), one for the degree
  // of the finite element (which we need to enable efficient computations
  // through the FEEvaluation class), and one for the underlying scalar
  // type. We want to use <code>double</code> numbers (i.e., double precision,
  // 64-bit floating point) for the final matrix, but floats (single
  // precision, 32-bit floating point numbers) for the multigrid level
  // matrices (as that is only a preconditioner, and floats can be processed
  // twice as fast). The class FEEvaluation also takes a template argument for
  // the number of quadrature points in one dimension. In the code below, we
  // hard-code it to <code>fe_degree+1</code>. If we wanted to change it
  // independently of the polynomial degree, we would need to add a template
  // parameter as is done in the MatrixFreeOperators::LaplaceOperator class.
  //
  // As a sidenote, if we implemented several different operations on the same
  // grid and degrees of freedom (like a mass matrix and a Laplace matrix), we
  // would define two classes like the current one for each of the operators
  // (derived from the MatrixFreeOperators::Base class), and let both of them
  // refer to the same MatrixFree data cache from the general problem
  // class. The interface through MatrixFreeOperators::Base requires us to
  // only provide a minimal set of functions. This concept allows for writing
  // complex application codes with many matrix-free operations.
  //
  // @note Storing values of type <code>VectorizedArray<number></code>
  // requires care: Here, we use the deal.II table class which is prepared to
  // hold the data with correct alignment. However, storing e.g. an
  // <code>std::vector<VectorizedArray<number> ></code> is not possible with
  // vectorization: A certain alignment of the data with the memory address
  // boundaries is required (essentially, a VectorizedArray that is 32 bytes
  // long in case of AVX needs to start at a memory address that is divisible
  // by 32). The table class (as well as the AlignedVector class it is based
  // on) makes sure that this alignment is respected, whereas std::vector does
  // not in general, which may lead to segmentation faults at strange places
  // for some systems or suboptimal performance for other systems.

  // @sect4{Local evaluation of Laplace operator}

  // Here comes the main function of this class, the evaluation of the
  // matrix-vector product (or, in general, a finite element operator
  // evaluation). This is done in a function that takes exactly four
  // arguments, the MatrixFree object, the destination and source vectors, and
  // a range of cells that are to be worked on. The method
  // <code>cell_loop</code> in the MatrixFree class will internally call this
  // function with some range of cells that is obtained by checking which
  // cells are possible to work on simultaneously so that write operations do
  // not cause any race condition. Note that the cell range used in the loop
  // is not directly the number of (active) cells in the current mesh, but
  // rather a collection of batches of cells.  In other word, "cell" may be
  // the wrong term to begin with, since FEEvaluation groups data from several
  // cells together. This means that in the loop over quadrature points we are
  // actually seeing a group of quadrature points of several cells as one
  // block. This is done to enable a higher degree of vectorization.  The
  // number of such "cells" or "cell batches" is stored in MatrixFree and can
  // be queried through MatrixFree::n_cell_batches(). Compared to the deal.II
  // cell iterators, in this class all cells are laid out in a plain array
  // with no direct knowledge of level or neighborship relations, which makes
  // it possible to index the cells by unsigned integers.
  //
  // The implementation of the Laplace operator is quite simple: First, we
  // need to create an object FEEvaluation that contains the computational
  // kernels and has data fields to store temporary results (e.g. gradients
  // evaluated on all quadrature points on a collection of a few cells). Note
  // that temporary results do not use a lot of memory, and since we specify
  // template arguments with the element order, the data is stored on the
  // stack (without expensive memory allocation). Usually, one only needs to
  // set two template arguments, the dimension as a first argument and the
  // degree of the finite element as the second argument (this is equal to the
  // number of degrees of freedom per dimension minus one for FE_Q
  // elements). However, here we also want to be able to use float numbers for
  // the multigrid preconditioner, which is the last (fifth) template
  // argument. Therefore, we cannot rely on the default template arguments and
  // must also fill the third and fourth field, consequently. The third
  // argument specifies the number of quadrature points per direction and has
  // a default value equal to the degree of the element plus one. The fourth
  // argument sets the number of components (one can also evaluate
  // vector-valued functions in systems of PDEs, but the default is a scalar
  // element), and finally the last argument sets the number type.
  //
  // Next, we loop over the given cell range and then we continue with the
  // actual implementation: <ol> <li>Tell the FEEvaluation object the (macro)
  // cell we want to work on.  <li>Read in the values of the source vectors
  // (@p read_dof_values), including the resolution of constraints. This
  // stores $u_\mathrm{cell}$ as described in the introduction.  <li>Compute
  // the unit-cell gradient (the evaluation of finite element
  // functions). Since FEEvaluation can combine value computations with
  // gradient computations, it uses a unified interface to all kinds of
  // derivatives of order between zero and two. We only want gradients, no
  // values and no second derivatives, so we set the function arguments to
  // true in the gradient slot (second slot), and to false in the values slot
  // (first slot). There is also a third slot for the Hessian which is
  // false by default, so it needs not be given. Note that the FEEvaluation
  // class internally evaluates shape functions in an efficient way where one
  // dimension is worked on at a time (using the tensor product form of shape
  // functions and quadrature points as mentioned in the introduction). This
  // gives complexity equal to $\mathcal O(d^2 (p+1)^{d+1})$ for polynomial
  // degree $p$ in $d$ dimensions, compared to the naive approach with loops
  // over all local degrees of freedom and quadrature points that is used in
  // FEValues and costs $\mathcal O(d (p+1)^{2d})$.  <li>Next comes the
  // application of the Jacobian transformation, the multiplication by the
  // variable coefficient and the quadrature weight. FEEvaluation has an
  // access function @p get_gradient that applies the Jacobian and returns the
  // gradient in real space. Then, we just need to multiply by the (scalar)
  // coefficient, and let the function @p submit_gradient apply the second
  // Jacobian (for the test function) and the quadrature weight and Jacobian
  // determinant (JxW). Note that the submitted gradient is stored in the same
  // data field as where it is read from in @p get_gradient. Therefore, you
  // need to make sure to not read from the same quadrature point again after
  // having called @p submit_gradient on that particular quadrature point. In
  // general, it is a good idea to copy the result of @p get_gradient when it
  // is used more often than once.  <li>Next follows the summation over
  // quadrature points for all test functions that corresponds to the actual
  // integration step. For the Laplace operator, we just multiply by the
  // gradient, so we call the integrate function with the respective argument
  // set. If you have an equation where you test by both the values of the
  // test functions and the gradients, both template arguments need to be set
  // to true. Calling first the integrate function for values and then
  // gradients in a separate call leads to wrong results, since the second
  // call will internally overwrite the results from the first call. Note that
  // there is no function argument for the second derivative for integrate
  // step.  <li>Eventually, the local contributions in the vector
  // $v_\mathrm{cell}$ as mentioned in the introduction need to be added into
  // the result vector (and constraints are applied). This is done with a call
  // to @p distribute_local_to_global, the same name as the corresponding
  // function in the AffineConstraints (only that we now store the local vector
  // in the FEEvaluation object, as are the indices between local and global
  // degrees of freedom).  </ol>

  // MatrixFree, OutVector, InVector, cell_range. When working with MPI
  // parallelization (but no threading) as is done in this tutorial program,

  //
  // @code
  // src.update_ghost_values();
  // local_apply(*this->data, dst, src, std::make_pair(0U,
  //                                                   data.n_cell_batches()));
  // dst.compress(VectorOperation::add);
  // @endcode
  //
  // Here, the two calls update_ghost_values() and compress() perform the data
  // exchange on processor boundaries for MPI, once for the source vector
  // where we need to read from entries owned by remote processors, and once
  // for the destination vector where we have accumulated parts of the
  // residuals that need to be added to the respective entry of the owner
  // processor. However, MatrixFree::cell_loop does not only abstract away
  // those two calls, but also performs some additional optimizations. On the
  // one hand, it will split the update_ghost_values() and compress() calls in
  // a way to allow for overlapping communication and computation. The
  // local_apply function is then called with three cell ranges representing
  // partitions of the cell range from 0 to MatrixFree::n_cell_batches(). On
  // the other hand, cell_loop also supports thread parallelism in which case
  // the cell ranges are split into smaller chunks and scheduled in an
  // advanced way that avoids access to the same vector entry by several
  // threads. That feature is explained in step-48.
  //
  // Note that after the cell loop, the constrained degrees of freedom need to
  // be touched once more for sensible vmult() operators: Since the assembly
  // loop automatically resolves constraints (just as the
  // AffineConstraints::distribute_local_to_global() call does), it does not
  // compute any contribution for constrained degrees of freedom, leaving the
  // respective entries zero. This would represent a matrix that had empty
  // rows and columns for constrained degrees of freedom. However, iterative
  // solvers like CG only work for non-singular matrices. The easiest way to
  // do that is to set the sub-block of the matrix that corresponds to
  // constrained DoFs to an identity matrix, in which case application of the
  // matrix would simply copy the elements of the right hand side vector into
  // the left hand side. Fortunately, the vmult() implementations
  // MatrixFreeOperators::Base do this automatically for us outside the
  // apply_add() function, so we do not need to take further action here.
  //
  // When using the combination of MatrixFree and FEEvaluation in parallel
  // with MPI, there is one aspect to be careful about &mdash; the indexing
  // used for accessing the vector. For performance reasons, MatrixFree and
  // FEEvaluation are designed to access vectors in MPI-local index space also
  // when working with multiple processors. Working in local index space means
  // that no index translation needs to be performed at the place the vector
  // access happens, apart from the unavoidable indirect addressing. However,
  // local index spaces are ambiguous: While it is standard convention to
  // access the locally owned range of a vector with indices between 0 and the
  // local size, the numbering is not so clear for the ghosted entries and
  // somewhat arbitrary. For the matrix-vector product, only the indices
  // appearing on locally owned cells (plus those referenced via hanging node
  // constraints) are necessary. However, in deal.II we often set all the
  // degrees of freedom on ghosted elements as ghosted vector entries, called
  // the @ref GlossLocallyRelevantDof "locally relevant DoFs described in the
  // glossary". In that case, the MPI-local index of a ghosted vector entry
  // can in general be different in the two possible ghost sets, despite
  // referring to the same global index. To avoid problems, FEEvaluation
  // checks that the partitioning of the vector used for the matrix-vector
  // product does indeed match with the partitioning of the indices in
  // MatrixFree by a check called
  // LinearAlgebra::distributed::Vector::partitioners_are_compatible. To
  // facilitate things, the MatrixFreeOperators::Base class includes a
  // mechanism to fit the ghost set to the correct layout. This happens in the
  // ghost region of the vector, so keep in mind that the ghost region might
  // be modified in both the destination and source vector after a call to a
  // vmult() method. This is legitimate because the ghost region of a
  // distributed deal.II vector is a mutable section and filled on
  // demand. Vectors used in matrix-vector products must not be ghosted upon
  // entry of vmult() functions, so no information gets lost.

  // The following function implements the computation of the diagonal of the

  // there usually is a coupling between all degrees of freedom inside the

  //
  // We first initialize the diagonal vector to the correct parallel
  // layout. This vector is encapsulated in a member called

  // In the local compute loop, we compute the diagonal by a loop over all

  // differential operator on one unit vector at a time. The inner part
  // invoking FEEvaluation::evaluate, the loop over quadrature points, and
  // FEEvalution::integrate, is exactly the same as in the local_apply
  // function. Afterwards, we pick out the <i>i</i>th entry of the local
  // result and put it to a temporary storage (as we overwrite all entries in
  // the array behind FEEvaluation::get_dof_value() with the next loop
  // iteration). Finally, the temporary storage is written to the destination
  // vector. Note how we use FEEvaluation::get_dof_value() and
  // FEEvaluation::submit_dof_value() to read and write to the data field that
  // FEEvaluation uses for the integration on the one hand and writes into the
  // global vector on the other hand.
  //
  // Given that we are only interested in the matrix diagonal, we simply throw
  // away all other entries of the local matrix that have been computed along
  // the way. While it might seem wasteful to compute the complete cell matrix
  // and then throw away everything but the diagonal, the integration are so
  // efficient that the computation does not take too much time. Note that the
  // complexity of operator evaluation per element is $\mathcal
  // O((p+1)^{d+1})$ for polynomial degree $k$, so computing the whole matrix
  // costs us $\mathcal O((p+1)^{2d+1})$ operations, not too far away from
  // $\mathcal O((p+1)^{2d})$ complexity for computing the diagonal with
  // FEValues. Since FEEvaluation is also considerably faster due to
  // vectorization and other optimizations, the diagonal computation with this
  // function is actually the fastest (simple) variant. (It would be possible
  // to compute the diagonal with sum factorization techniques in $\mathcal
  // O((p+1)^{d+1})$ operations involving specifically adapted
  // kernels&mdash;but since such kernels are only useful in that particular
  // context and the diagonal computation is typically not on the critical
  // path, they have not been implemented in deal.II.)
  //
  // Note that the code that calls distribute_local_to_global on the vector to
  // accumulate the diagonal entries into the global matrix has some
  // limitations. For operators with hanging node constraints that distribute
  // an integral contribution of a constrained DoF to several other entries
  // inside the distribute_local_to_global call, the vector interface used
  // here does not exactly compute the diagonal entries, but lumps some
  // contributions located on the diagonal of the local matrix that would end
  // up in a off-diagonal position of the global matrix to the diagonal. The
  // result is correct up to discretization accuracy as explained in <a
  // href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4208/cicp.101214.021015a">Kormann (2016),
  // section 5.3</a>, but not mathematically equal. In this tutorial program,
  // no harm can happen because the diagonal is only used for the multigrid
  // level matrices where no hanging node constraints appear.

  //
  // The class also has a member variable to keep track of all the detailed

  // about solving the problem. In addition, there is an output stream (that
  // is disabled by default) that can be used to output details for the
  // individual setup operations instead of the summary only that is printed
  // out by default.
  //
  // Since this program is designed to be used with MPI, we also provide the
  // usual @p pcout output stream that only prints the information of the
  // processor with MPI rank 0. The grid used for this programs can either be
  // a distributed triangulation based on p4est (in case deal.II is configured
  // to use p4est), otherwise it is a serial grid that only runs without MPI.

  // LaplaceOperator class. The first thing to do is to set up the DoFHandler,
  // including the degrees of freedom for the multigrid levels, and to
  // initialize constraints from hanging nodes and homogeneous Dirichlet
  // conditions. Since we intend to use this programs in %parallel with MPI,
  // we need to make sure that the constraints get to know the locally
  // relevant degrees of freedom, otherwise the storage would explode when
  // using more than a few hundred millions of degrees of freedom, see
  // step-40.

  // Once we have created the multigrid dof_handler and the constraints, we
  // can call the reinit function for the global matrix operator as well as
  // each level of the multigrid scheme. The main action is to set up the
  // <code> MatrixFree </code> instance for the problem. The base class of the
  // <code>LaplaceOperator</code> class, MatrixFreeOperators::Base, is
  // initialized with a shared pointer to MatrixFree object. This way, we can
  // simply create it here and then pass it on to the system matrix and level
  // matrices, respectively. For setting up MatrixFree, we need to activate
  // the update flag in the AdditionalData field of MatrixFree that enables
  // the storage of quadrature point coordinates in real space (by default, it
  // only caches data for gradients (inverse transposed Jacobians) and JxW
  // values). Note that if we call the reinit function without specifying the
  // level (i.e., giving <code>level = numbers::invalid_unsigned_int</code>),
  // MatrixFree constructs a loop over the active cells. In this tutorial, we
  // do not use threads in addition to MPI, which is why we explicitly disable
  // it by setting the MatrixFree::AdditionalData::tasks_parallel_scheme to
  // MatrixFree::AdditionalData::none. Finally, the coefficient is evaluated

    // in the smoother where $\hat{\lambda}_{\max}$ is an estimate of the
    // largest eigenvalue (the factor 1.2 is applied inside
    // PreconditionChebyshev). In order to compute that eigenvalue, the
    // Chebyshev initialization performs a few steps of a CG algorithm
    // without preconditioner. Since the highest eigenvalue is usually the
    // easiest one to find and a rough estimate is enough, we choose 10
    // iterations. Finally, we also set the inner preconditioner type in the
    // Chebyshev method which is a Jacobi iteration. This is represented by
    // the DiagonalMatrix class that gets the inverse diagonal entry provided
    // by our LaplaceOperator class.
    //
    // On level zero, we initialize the smoother differently because we want
    // to use the Chebyshev iteration as a solver. PreconditionChebyshev
    // allows the user to switch to solver mode where the number of iterations
    // is internally chosen to the correct value. In the additional data
    // object, this setting is activated by choosing the polynomial degree to
    // @p numbers::invalid_unsigned_int. The algorithm will then attack all
    // eigenvalues between the smallest and largest one in the coarse level
    // matrix. The number of steps in the Chebyshev smoother are chosen such
    // that the Chebyshev convergence estimates guarantee to reduce the
    // residual by the number specified in the variable @p
    // smoothing_range. Note that for solving, @p smoothing_range is a
    // relative tolerance and chosen smaller than one, in this case, we select
    // three orders of magnitude, whereas it is a number larger than 1 when
    // only selected eigenvalues are smoothed.
    //
    // From a computational point of view, the Chebyshev iteration is a very
    // attractive coarse grid solver as long as the coarse size is
    // moderate. This is because the Chebyshev method performs only
    // matrix-vector products and vector updates, which typically parallelize
    // better to the largest cluster size with more than a few tens of

    // global mesh will be covered. At some coarser level, the whole mesh will
    // be covered. Since all level matrices in the multigrid method cover a
    // single level in the mesh, no hanging nodes appear on the level matrices.
    // At the interface between multigrid levels, homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
    // conditions are set while smoothing. When the residual is transferred to
    // the next coarser level, however, the coupling over the multigrid
    // interface needs to be taken into account. This is done by the so-called
    // interface (or edge) matrices that compute the part of the residual that
    // is missed by the level matrix with
    // homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. We refer to the @ref mg_paper
    // "Multigrid paper by Janssen and Kanschat" for more details.
    //
    // For the implementation of those interface matrices, there is already a
    // pre-defined class MatrixFreeOperators::MGInterfaceOperator that wraps
    // the routines MatrixFreeOperators::Base::vmult_interface_down() and
    // MatrixFreeOperators::Base::vmult_interface_up() in a new class with @p
    // vmult() and @p Tvmult() operations (that were originally written for
    // matrices, hence expecting those names). Note that vmult_interface_down
    // is used during the restriction phase of the multigrid V-cycle, whereas
    // vmult_interface_up is used during the prolongation phase.
    //
    // Once the interface matrix is created, we set up the remaining Multigrid
    // preconditioner infrastructure in complete analogy to step-16 to obtain
    // a @p preconditioner object that can be applied to a matrix.
