<h1>Introduction</h1>

As a follow up to the Helmholtz equation "with the nice
sign" of step-7, here we will consider the version of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_equation">equation with the
"bad sign"</a> , commonly referred as the indefinite Helmholtz equation:
@f[
  -\Delta u - \alpha u = f.
@f]
This equation naturally arises in the study of time-harmonic wave phenomena, such as electromagnetic or acoustic propagation. In particular, it corresponds to the time-independent form of the wave equation when $\alpha = \omega^2$ is the square of the angular frequency.

From a numerical perspective, solving this equation poses a number of well-known challenges, which become increasingly severe as the parameter $\alpha > 0$ grows. Notably, the oscillatory nature of the solution requires the wavelength to be adequately resolved by the discretization and $\alpha$
must not coincide with an eigenvalue of $-\Delta$ or the resulting operator will not be invertible.

Among the numerical difficulties that arise from this equation,
one that is really challenging is the indefiniteness of the
operator. It hinders the ability of classical iterative methods
to solve the linear system of equations. Furthermore, most blackbox
preconditioners fail to improve convergence as explained in details by O. Ernst
and M. J. Gander @cite ernst2012. A solution to this
problem is to make our discretized system of equations
positive definite, which brings us to the subject of this tutorial, the 
Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) method @cite demkowicz2025. This approach can be classified
as a residual minimization method and always yields an Hermitian positive
definite stiffness matrix system. It follows that using this method allows
for the use of the preconditioned conjugate gradient (CG) linear solver
instead of a direct solver.

The numerical implementation of DPG shares many similarities with hybridizable
discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods. In particular, it relies on trace
elements to couple neighboring cells and on discontinuous Galerkin elements for
the interior unknowns. The resulting linear system has a structure analogous
to that of HDG methods, allowing static condensation to reduce the system
size by eliminating interior unknowns through a Schur-complement procedure.

For readers who want to learn more about the implementation of trace
unknowns, static condensation, and HDG formulations, step-51 provides a
detailed introduction.


<h3>The time-harmonic Helmholtz equation</h3>

For our case study of the indefinite Helmholtz equation, we consider the linear
acoustic equations in a 2D square domain $[0,1] \times [0,1]$. These equations arise from the linearization of the compressible fluid equations about a quiescent background state and read :
@f{align*}{
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{U}}{\partial t} & = - \frac{1}{\rho }\nabla(P) \quad \text{in } \Omega, \qquad \text{(Linear momentum),}\\ 
    \frac{1}{K}\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} & = - \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{U}), \quad \text{in }
    \Omega \qquad \text{(Mass conservation)}.
@f} 
Here, $\mathbf{U}(\mathbf{x},t)$ denotes the velocity perturbation, $P(\mathbf{x},t)$ the pressure perturbation, $\rho$ the mean fluid density, and $K$ the bulk modulus.

We now assume that both pressure and velocity perturbations are time harmonic with angular frequency $\omega$, i.e.,
@f{align*}{
\mathbf{U}(\mathbf{x},t) &= \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x})e^{i\omega t}, \qquad
P(\mathbf{x},t) &= p(\mathbf{x})e^{i\omega t}.
@f}
Substituting this ansatz into the time-dependent equations and dividing out the common factor $e^{i\omega t}$ yields the frequency-domain system:
@f{align*}{
    i\omega \mathbf{u} + \nabla p^*                         & = 0,
    \quad \text{in } \Omega,\\ i\omega
    \frac{p^*}{c_s^2} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}     & = 0, \quad \text{in }
    \Omega.
@f} 
In the above, we introduced the kinematic pressure $p^* = p/\rho$ and the speed of
sound $c_s = \sqrt{K/\rho}$ for notational convenience.

At first glance, this first-order system does not resemble the indefinite Helmholtz equation for the acoustic pressure. However, by isolating $\mathbf{u}$ from the linear momentum equation, substituting it into the mass conservation equation, and multiplying the resulting expression by $i\omega$, we recover the classical second-order form : 
@f{align*}{
    -\Delta p^* - \omega^2 \frac{p^*}{c_s^2} & = 0,
@f} 
This corresponds to the homogeneous Helmholtz equation with $\alpha = \omega^2 / c_s^2$, i.e., the special case $f = 0$ of the general indefinite Helmholtz problem which we will keep in what follows. Nevertheless, that the source term $f$ could be reintroduced in the mass conservation equation if there is mass injection or extraction in the domain.

In what follow, we consider $c_s=1$ for simplicity and will also describe all the possible types of boundary conditions on $\Gamma$
to showcase their different implementation in the framework: 
@f{align*}{
    p^* & = g_D, \quad \text{on } \Gamma_0, \\ \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}
    & = g_N, \quad \text{on } \Gamma_2, \\ \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}  -
    \frac{ k_n }{\omega} p^* & = g_R, \quad \text{on } \Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_3,
@f} 
where the subscript numbers follow the same nomenclature as the one
for a rectangular geometry obtained from the GridGenerator::hyper_cube() function, $k_n$
is the wavenumber in the direction of the surface normal and $g_{D,N,R}$
refers to Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions terms.

To validate our implementation and study the effect of the angular frequency on
our system, we choose the boundaries so the expected solution
is a plane-wave travelling in the direction $\theta \in [0, \pi /2]$, i.e.:
@f{align*}{
    g_D &= e^{-i k y \sin(\theta)},\\ g_N &= -\sin(\theta) e^{-i
    k x \cos(\theta)},\\ g_R &= 0.
@f}
The analytical solution is therefore: 
@f{align*}{
p^*        & = e^{-i k (x \cos(\theta) + y \sin(\theta))},
\\
    \mathbf{u} & = \frac{1}{c_s} \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta)  \\ \sin(\theta)
    \end{pmatrix} e^{-i k (x \cos(\theta) + y \sin(\theta))}.
@f}
Note that the wavenumber $k$ introduced above for the plane-wave solution is chosen to satisfy $k = \omega/c_s = \sqrt{\alpha}$. In this way, the oscillation scale of the solution is consistent with the natural wavelength of the Helmholtz operator.

To solve the acoustic linear system presented above using FEM, it its
common to use the classical second-order form and multiply it by a test function $q$ to obtain the following weak variational formulation:
@f{align*}{
  \text{Find } & p^* \in H^1(\Omega) \text{ so that}\\ & (\nabla q, \nabla p^*) - \omega^2 (q, p^*) - \langle
  q, \frac{\partial p^*}{\partial n} \rangle_{\Gamma} = 0, \quad \forall q \in H^1(\Omega).  @f}
In the above, we used the following definitions for the (sesquilinear) $L^2$ complex inner products on the domain $\Omega$ and its boundary $\Gamma$ :
@f{align*}{
  (a,b)_\Omega & := \int_{\Omega} \overline{a} b
  \text{d}x \approx \sum_{K\in \Omega_h} \int_{K} \overline{a} b
  \text{d}x &  & \langle a,b \rangle_{\Gamma} := \int_{\Gamma} \overline{a}b \text{d}s \approx \sum_{L\in\Gamma_h}
  \int_{L} \overline{a}b \text{d}s ,
  @f}
where $\Omega_h = \bigcup K$ is the discretized domain, with elements $K$, and $\Gamma_h = \bigcup L$ is the discretized boundary, with elements $L$.

In the DPG literature, this weak formulation of the second-order equation is referred to as the primal formulation in the DPG literature. While widely used, there are other ways to weaken the strong form of the problem notably one that is referred to as the ultraweak form. This alternative representation is obtained by using the first-order system presented above and relaxing both equations independently. Here, we will use the vector-valued test function $\mathbf{v}$ to weaken the mass conservation equation and the scalar test function $q$ to weaken the linear momentum equation. The resulting ultraweak variational formulation of our indefinite Helmholtz problem is then:
@f{align*}{
  \text{Find } & p^* \in L^2(\Omega) \text{ and } \mathbf{u} \in
  (L^2(\Omega))^d \text{ so that} \\ & ( \mathbf{v}, i \omega \mathbf{u})_{\Omega_h}
  - (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}, p^*)_{\Omega_h} + \langle \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}, p^*
  \rangle_{\Gamma} = 0, \quad \forall
  \mathbf{v} \in H(\text{div}, K), \\
  &(q, i\omega p^*)_{\Omega_h} - (\nabla
  q, \mathbf{u})_{\Omega_h} + \langle q, \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}
  \rangle_{\Gamma} = 0, \quad \forall q \in
  H^1(K).
  @f}
This is the system of equation that we will use and solve in the tutorial since previous DPG studies showed that the problem formulated in this manner leads to better results because of its approximability properties. 

<h3>The Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin Method</h3>

There are numerous papers that describe the mathematics behind the DPG method,
here we will focus mainly on the key elements necessary to understand the
numerical implementation. Let’s start with a standard abstract problem
defined on the product of the trial and test Hilbert spaces $U \times V$
such that:
 @f{equation*}{
    \begin{cases}
        b(u,v) = l(v) \quad \forall v \in V, \\ u \in U,
    \end{cases}
@f} where $b(u,v)$ is a continuous bilinear form and $l(v)$ is a continuous
linear form. Furthermore, we assume that the problem is well-posed (i.e.,
 $b$ is coercive, or satisfies a continuous inf-sup condition). This can be reformulated as an
operator equation by defining the operator $B: U \rightarrow V'$ such that :
@f{equation*}{
    b(u,v) = \langle B u, v \rangle_{V' \times V},
@f}
where $V'$ is the dual space of $V$ and the $\langle \cdot, \cdot
\rangle_{V' \times V}$ denotes the duality pairing. This is one possible FEM discretization, typically referred to as the "Galerkin least squares method", where the residual in the dual norm is minimized over a finite-dimensional trial space.

This finite element discretization leads to the following minimal residual formulation of the problem:
@f{equation*}{
    u_h = \arg \min_{w_h \in U_h} J(w_h), \quad \text{where} \quad J(w_h)
    = \frac{1}{2} \| l - B w_h \|_{V'}^2
@f}
where $u_h$ is the discrete approximated solution. However, numerically
computing the dual norm is not always feasible, so it is avoided by introducing
a Riesz operator $R: V \rightarrow V'$. Using the inverse Riesz operator,
it is now possible to formulate an alternative discrete problem as: 
@f{equation*}{
    u_h = \arg \min_{w_h \in U_h} \frac{1}{2} \| R^{-1}(l - B w_h) \|_{V}^2.
@f}
This solves the problem of computing the norm of the dual space. Still,
we now require the inverse Riesz operator. This is not achievable numerically
because the Riesz map is related to the infinite-dimensional space $V$ and
its inversion is equivalent to solving a partial differential equation. To overcome this, the test space is "broken" between each individual element and enriched by raising its
polynomial degree by $\Delta p$ (typically chosen to be 1 or 2) compared to the
trial space. The resulting finite-dimensional space  $V^r \subset V$ is now a
truncated version of the original space, nonetheless, it can fully represent
the Riesz map on each element by the Gram matrix. The broken test functions
have no conformity assumptions across the inter-element boundaries. They leave
uncanceled interface terms, and thus require the introduction of interface
unknowns (often called trace variables, or Lagrange multipliers $\hat{u}$)
that live on the mesh skeleton and weakly enforce the continuity. The final
form of the abstract problem that needs to be solved in a DPG setting is:
@f{equation*}{
    \label{eq:DPG_abstract_problem} \begin{cases}
        \text{Find } u_h \in U_h \subset U, \quad \hat{u}_h \in \hat{U}_h \subset \hat{U} \text{ and }
        \quad \Psi^r \in V^r(\Omega_h) \text{ so that},           \\ (\Psi^r, v^r)_V + b_h(u_h,
        v^r) + \langle \hat{u}_h, v^r \rangle = l(v^r), \quad \forall v^r \in
        V^r(\Omega_h), \\ b_h(w_h, \Psi^r) = 0, \quad \forall w_h \in U_h,
        \\ \langle \hat{w}_h, \Psi^r \rangle = 0, \quad \forall \hat{w}_h
        \in \hat{U}_h,
    \end{cases}
@f}
where $\Psi^r = R^{-1}_r(l-Bu_h)$. Finally, by defining the bases for
discretized trial space $U_h \times \hat{U}_h$ and the discretized broken test
space $V^r(\Omega_h)$, such that $U_h = \text{span}\{ \phi_i \}_{i=1}^{N_u}$,
$\hat{U}_h = \text{span}\{ \hat{\phi}_i \}_{i=1}^{N_{\hat{u}}}$ and $V^r=
\text{span}\{ \Psi_i \}_{i=1}^{N_v}$, where $N_v > N_u + N_{\hat{u}}$,
the problem can be solved numerically by finding the set of coefficients: 
@f[
    \mathbf{w} = [w_i]_{i=1}^{N_u} \in \mathbb{F}^{N_u}, \quad \hat{\mathbf{w}}
    = [\hat{w}_i]_{\hat{i}=1}^{N_{\hat{u}}} \in \mathbb{F}^{N_{\hat{u}}},
    \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{q} = [q_i]_{i=1}^{N_v} \in \mathbb{F}^{N_v}
@f]
such that:
@f[
    u_h = \sum_{i=1}^{N_u} w_i \phi_i, \quad \hat{u}_h =
    \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\hat{u}}} \hat{w}_i \hat{\phi}_i, \quad \Psi^r =
    \sum_{i=1}^{N_v} q_i \Psi_i
@f] 
satisfy the following system: 
@f{equation*}{
    \begin{pmatrix}
        G               & B & \hat{B} \\ B^\dagger       & 0 & 0       \\
        \hat{B}^\dagger & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
        \Psi^r \\ u_h    \\ \hat{u}_h
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
        l \\ 0 \\ 0
    \end{pmatrix},
@f}
 where the $\dagger$ symbol is used to denote the conjugate transpose
operation. Solving this system of linear equation is analogous to solving
a general overdetermined system in a least squares sense with a residual
$\Psi^r$. This is why the DPG method always produces hermitian positive
definite systems of equations. Furthermore, it shows that $\Psi^r$ can be
used to obtain an error indicator for adaptive hp-refinement.

<h4>Polynomial space</h4>

As presented above, the DPG method is based on the idea that the test space
is not bound to the same space as the one for the trial space and that it
can be chosen to maximize the accuracy and the stability of the numerical
method. Consequently, to implement the DPG method for any set of equations,
one needs to be able to discretize the whole exact sequence of energy spaces,
which in 3D takes the form: 
@f[
    H^1 \xrightarrow{\nabla} H(\mathrm{curl}) \xrightarrow{\nabla \times}
    H(\mathrm{div}) \xrightarrow{\nabla \cdot} L^2
@f] 
These spaces are defined as: 
@f{align*}{
     & H^1(\Omega) = \{ u : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}(\mathbb{C})
     : u \in L^2(\Omega), \nabla u \in (L^2(\Omega))^3 \}
     \\ & H(\text{curl}, \Omega) = \{ \mathbf{E} : \Omega \to
     \mathbb{R}^3(\mathbb{C}^3) : \mathbf{E} \in (L^2(\Omega))^3, \nabla
     \times \mathbf{E} \in (L^2(\Omega))^3 \} \\ & H(\text{div}, \Omega) =
     \{ \mathbf{v} : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^3(\mathbb{C}^3) : \mathbf{v} \in
     (L^2(\Omega))^3, \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \in L^2(\Omega) \}       \\ &
     L^2(\Omega) = \{ q : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}(\mathbb{C}) : \|q\| < \infty \}
@f}
In addition, the continuity requirements along faces and edges (the
skeleton of the mesh), is also enforced with a different space because it
lives in $dim -1$ dimensions. Thus, we also need to define this sequence of
energy space for the skeleton:
@f{align*}{
    H^{1/2}(\partial K)               & =
    \text{tr}_{\text{grad}}(H^1(\Omega_h))
    :=  \prod_{K \in \Omega_h} u\big|_{\partial K}
    \\ H^{-1/2}(\text{curl}, \partial K) & = \text{tr}_{\text{curl},
    \top}(H(\text{curl}, \Omega_h)) := \prod_{K \in \Omega_h} (\mathbf{n}_K
    \times \mathbf{E}) \times \mathbf{n}_K \big|_{\partial K} \\
    H^{-1/2}(\text{div}, \partial K)  & = \text{tr}_{\text{curl}, \dashv
    }(H(\text{curl}, \Omega_h)) := \prod_{K \in \Omega_h} (\mathbf{n}_K \times
    \mathbf{E}) \big|_{\partial K}                  \\ H^{-1/2}(\partial
    K)              & = \text{tr}_{\text{div}}(H(\text{div}, \Omega_h)) :=
    \prod_{K \in \Omega_h}  (\mathbf{n}_K \cdot \textbf{v} ) \big|_{\partial K}
@f}

<h4>Application to the acoustic Helmholtz equation</h4>

Now if we apply the DPG method to the acoustic Helmholtz ultraweak
formulation presented above, we get the following : 
@f{align*}{ 
   \text{Find } & p^* \in L^2(\Omega) \text{ and } \mathbf{u} \in (L^2(\Omega))^d \text{ so that} \\ & (i \omega
\mathbf{u}, \overline{\mathbf{v}})_{\Omega_h} - (p^*, \overline{\nabla
\cdot \mathbf{v}})_{\Omega_h} + \langle \hat{p}^*, \overline{\mathbf{v}
\cdot \mathbf{n}} \rangle_{\partial \Omega_h} + \langle \hat{p}^*,
\overline{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n}} \rangle_{\Gamma} = 0, \quad \forall
\mathbf{v} \in H(\text{div}, K), \\
    &(i\omega p^*, \overline{q})_{\Omega_h} - (\mathbf{u}, \overline{\nabla
    q})_{\Omega_h} + \langle \hat{u}_n,\overline{q} \rangle_{\partial
    \Omega_h} + \langle \hat{u}_n,\overline{q} \rangle_{\Gamma} = (f,
    \overline{q})_{\Omega_h}, \quad \forall q \in H^1(K).
@f}
where we make explicit the difference between the mesh skeleton terms
$\hat{u}_n$ and $\hat{p}^*$ and the interior terms $\mathbf{u}$ and $p^*$
along with a distinction between the skeleton ($\partial \Omega_h$) and the
boundary ($\Gamma$). From the ultraweak formulation, we can identify the
functional space of our problem:
@f{align*}{
     & U = (L^2(\Omega))^{dim} \times L^2(\Omega) \times H^{-1/2}(\partial
     \Omega_h) \times H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega_h) , \\ & V = H(\text{div},
     \Omega_h) \times H^1(\Omega_h).
@f}
From it, we can also directly define the adjoint graph norm which will
be used to build the Gram matrix and control the residual: @f{equation*}{
     \|(\mathbf{v}, q)\|^2_V := \|A^* (\mathbf{v}, q)\|^2 + \beta^2
     (\|\mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|q\|^2 )= \|\ \overline{i\omega} \mathbf{v} -
     \nabla q \|^2 + \| \overline{i\omega} q - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}\|^2 +
     \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|q\|^2,
@f}
where $\beta = \mathcal{O}(1)$ is a scaling parameter necessary for
the stability of the method (here chosen to be one as it is commonly done
in the literature).

<h4>Implementation of the boundary conditions</h4>

When using the ultraweak form, we can readily implement both Dirichlet
and Neumann boundary conditions. The latter are in fact a Dirichlet
boundary condition on the flux variable of our problem, here the fluid
velocity. However, careful attention needs to be made with Robin boundary
conditions because they tie together the two fields of interest and we do
not want to overconstrain the system. To do so, here we will present the
method proposed by
J. Gopalakrishnan and J.  Schöberl @cite gopalakrishnan2014. We therefore add an approximate
version of the $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{n}  - \frac{ k_n }{\omega} p^* =
g_R$ into our system by adding the term: 
@f{align*}{
    \pm \bigg\langle \hat{u}_n - \frac{ k_n}{\omega} \hat{p}^*,
    \overline{\hat{w}_n - \frac{ k_n}{\omega} \hat{r}^*}  \bigg
    \rangle_{\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_3} = \pm \bigg\langle g_R,\overline{\hat{w}_n
    - \frac{ k_n}{\omega} \hat{r}^*} \bigg \rangle_{\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_3},
    \quad \forall \hat{w}_n \in H^{1/2}(\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_3), \hat{r}^*
    \in H^{-1/2}(\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_3)
@f} 
on the appropriate boundaries. This extra relation adds new terms in
the third equation of the DPG abstract formulation and change the overall
structure to the following: 
@f{equation*}{
    \begin{pmatrix}
        G               & B & \hat{B} \\ B^\dagger       & 0 & 0       \\
        \hat{B}^\dagger & 0 & D
    \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
        \Psi^r \\ u_h    \\ \hat{u}_h
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
        l \\ 0 \\ g_R
    \end{pmatrix}.
@f} 
In the above, we choose the sign so that the whole system remains positive
definite (i.e., the matrix $D$ needs to be negative semidefinite, so we choose
the sign to be the negative). As a final consequence of the Robin boundary
condition, we also want to control the residual on this boundary. Therefore,
we need to modify the adjoint graph norm to take it into account as follows:
@f{align*}{
    \|(\mathbf{v}, q)\|^2_E = \|\overline{i\omega}\mathbf{v} - \nabla q \|^2 +
    \|\overline{i\omega}q - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 +
    \|q\|^2 + \|\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{n} + \overline{\frac{k_n}{\omega}}
    q||^2_{\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_3}.
@f} 
We are now finally ready to build out the following DPG system for
our problem:


@f{equation*}{ \begin{pmatrix}
  (\mathbf{v}, \overline{\mathbf{v}})_{\Omega_h} + (\nabla \cdot
  \mathbf{v}, \overline{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}})_{\Omega_h} +

<h4>Final elementary system and condensation</h4>


Finally, because the Gramm matrix is block-diagonal where each block corresponds to a cell, it is common
to condense it in order to remove the residual unknowns. The resulting system
is: 
@f{equation*}{
    \begin{pmatrix}
        B^\dagger G^{-1}B       & B^\dagger G^{-1}\hat{B}           \\
        \hat{B}^\dagger G^{-1}B & \hat{B}^\dagger G^{-1}\hat{B} - D
    \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
        u_h \\ \hat{u}_h
    \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
        B^\dagger G^{-1}l \\ \hat{B}^\dagger G^{-1}l - g
    \end{pmatrix},
@f} 
where $u_h = \{\mathbf{u},p^*\}$ and $\hat{u}_h = \{\hat{u}_n,\hat{p}^*\}$.
To avoid extra computational cost when solving the
matrix, the system can be further condensed to solve only for the interface
degrees of freedom since the interior degrees of freedom are discontinuous
across element and can be locally condensed. By posing the following:
@f{align*}{
 & M_1 = B^\dagger G^{-1}B, & M_2 = B^\dagger G^{-1}\hat{B}, && M_3 =
 \hat{B}^\dagger G^{-1}\hat{B} - D, && M_4 = B^\dagger G^{-1} && M_5 =
 \hat{B}^\dagger G^{-1},
@f}
we can simply solve the system: 
@f{equation*}{
    (M_3 - M_2^\dagger M_1^{-1} M_2) \hat{u}_h = (M_5 - M_2^\dagger M_1^{-1}
    M_4) l - g,
@f} 
to obtain the solution on the faces of the mesh and then use it to recover the solution
$u_h$ in the interiors of cells, with the following relation:
@f{equation*}{
    u_h = M_1^{-1} (M_4 l - M_2 \hat{u}_h).
@f} 
This is the method that is presented in the code that follows.
