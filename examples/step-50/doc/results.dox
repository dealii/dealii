Here, the timing of the `solve()` function is split up in 3 parts: setting
up the multigrid preconditioner, execution of a single multigrid V-cycle, and
the CG solver. The V-cycle that is timed is unnecessary for the overall solve
and only meant to give an insight at the different costs for AMG and GMG.
Also it should be noted that when using the AMG solver, "Workload imbalance"
is not included in the output since the hierarchy of coarse meshes is not
required.

All results in this section are gathered on Intel Xeon Platinum 8280 (Cascade
Lake) nodes which have 56 cores and 192GB per node and support AVX-512 instructions,
allowing for vectorization over 8 doubles (vectorization used only in the matrix-free
computations). The code is compiled using gcc 7.1.0 with intel-mpi 17.0.3. Trilinos
12.10.1 is used for the matrix-based GMG/AMG computations.

We can then gather a variety of information by calling the program
with the input files that are provided in the directory in which
step-50 is located. Using these, and adjusting the number of mesh
refinement steps, we can produce information about how well the
program scales.

The following table gives weak scaling timings for this program on up to 256M DoFs
and 7,168 processors. (Recall that weak scaling keeps the number of
degrees of freedom per processor constant while increasing the number of
processors; i.e., it considers larger and larger problems.)
Here, $\mathbb{E}$ is the partition efficiency from the
 introduction (also equal to 1.0/workload imbalance), "Setup" is a combination
of setup, setup multigrid, assemble, and assemble multigrid from the timing blocks,
and "Prec" is the preconditioner setup. Ideally all times would stay constant
over each problem size for the individual solvers, but since the partition
efficiency decreases from 0.371 to 0.161 from largest to smallest problem size,
we expect to see an approximately $0.371/0.161=2.3$ times increase in timings
for GMG. This is, in fact, pretty close to what we really get:

On the other hand, the algebraic multigrid in the last set of columns
is relatively unaffected by the increasing imbalance of the mesh
hierarchy (because it doesn't use the mesh hierarchy) and the growth
in time is rather driven by other factors that are well documented in
the literature (most notably that the algorithmic complexity of
some parts of algebraic multigrid methods appears to be ${\cal O}(N
\log N)$ instead of ${\cal O}(N)$ for geometric multigrid).

The upshort of the table above is that the matrix-free geometric multigrid
method appears to be the fastest approach to solving this equation if
not by a huge margin. Matrix-based methods, on the other hand, are
consistently the worst.

The following figure provides strong scaling results for each method, i.e.,
we solve the same problem on more and more processors. Specifically,
we consider the problems after 16 mesh refinement cycles
(32M DoFs) and 19 cycles (256M DoFs), on between 56 to 28,672 processors:

While the matrix-based GMG solver and AMG scale similarly and have a
similar time to solution (at least as long as there is a substantial
number of unknowns per processor -- say, several 10,000), the
matrix-free GMG solver scales much better and solves the finer problem
in roughly the same time as the AMG solver for the coarser mesh with
only an eighth of the number of processors. Conversely, it can solve the
same problem on the same number of processors in about one eighth the
time.


<h3> Possible extensions </h3>

<h4> Testing convergence and higher order elements </h4>

The finite element degree is currently hard-coded as 2, see the template
arguments of the main class. It is easy to change. To test, it would be
interesting to switch to a test problem with a reference solution. This way,
you can compare error rates.

<h4> Coarse solver </h4>

A more interesting example would involve a more complicated coarse mesh (see
step-49 for inspiration). The issue in that case is that the coarsest
level of the mesh hierarchy is actually quite large, and one would
have to think about ways to solve the coarse level problem
efficiently. (This is not an issue for algebraic multigrid methods
because they would just continue to build coarser and coarser levels
of the matrix, regardless of their geometric origin.)

In the program here, we simply solve the coarse level problem with a
Conjugate Gradient method without any preconditioner. That is acceptable
if the coarse problem is really small -- for example, if the coarse
mesh had a single cell, then the coarse mesh problems has a $9\times 9$
matrix in 2d, and a $27\times 27$ matrix in 3d; for the coarse mesh we
use on the $L$-shaped domain of the current program, these sizes are
$21\times 21$ in 2d and $117\times 117$ in 3d. But if the coarse mesh
consists of hundreds or thousands of cells, this approach will no
longer work and might start to dominate the overall run-time of each V-cyle.
A common approach is then to solve the coarse mesh problem using an
algebraic multigrid preconditioner; this would then, however, require
assembling the coarse matrix (even for the matrix-free version) as
input to the AMG implementation.
