// Just this one is new: it declares a class
// <code>CompressedSparsityPattern</code>, which we will use and explain
// further down below.
#include <deal.II/lac/compressed_sparsity_pattern.h>

// We will make use of the std::find algorithm of the C++ standard library, so
// we have to include the following file for its declaration:
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>

// The last step is as in all previous programs:
namespace Step11
{
  using namespace dealii;

  // Then we declare a class which represents the solution of a Laplace
  // problem. As this example program is based on step-5, the class looks
  // rather the same, with the sole structural difference that the functions
  // <code>assemble_system</code> now calls <code>solve</code> itself, and is
  // thus called <code>assemble_and_solve</code>, and that the output function
  // was dropped since the solution function is so boring that it is not worth
  // being viewed.
  //
  // The only other noteworthy change is that the constructor takes a value
  // representing the polynomial degree of the mapping to be used later on,
  // and that it has another member variable representing exactly this
  // mapping. In general, this variable will occur in real applications at the
  // same places where the finite element is declared or used.

    // introduction, we constrain one of the nodes on the boundary by the
    // values of all other DoFs on the boundary. So, let us first pick out the
    // first boundary node from this list. We do that by searching for the
    // first <code>true</code> value in the array (note that

    // Next task is to generate a sparsity pattern. This is indeed a tricky
    // task here. Usually, we just call
    // <code>DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern</code> and condense the result
    // using the hanging node constraints. We have no hanging node constraints
    // here (since we only refine globally in this example), but we have this
    // global constraint on the boundary. This poses one severe problem in
    // this context: the <code>SparsityPattern</code> class wants us to state
    // beforehand the maximal number of entries per row, either for all rows
    // or for each row separately. There are functions in the library which
    // can tell you this number in case you just have hanging node constraints
    // (namely <code>DoFHandler::max_coupling_between_dofs</code>), but how is
    // this for the present case? The difficulty arises because the
    // elimination of the constrained degree of freedom requires a number of
    // additional entries in the matrix at places that are not so simple to
    // determine. We would therefore have a problem had we to give a maximal
    // number of entries per row here.
    //
    // Since this can be so difficult that no reasonable answer can be given
    // that allows allocation of only a reasonable amount of memory, there is
    // a class <code>CompressedSparsityPattern</code>, that can help us out
    // here. It does not require that we know in advance how many entries rows
    // could have, but allows just about any length. It is thus significantly
    // more flexible in case you do not have good estimates of row lengths,
    // however at the price that building up such a pattern is also
    // significantly more expensive than building up a pattern for which you
    // had information in advance. Nevertheless, as we have no other choice
    // here, we'll just build such an object by initializing it with the
    // dimensions of the matrix and calling another function
    // <code>DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern</code> to get the sparsity
    // pattern due to the differential operator, then condense it with the
    // constraints object which adds those positions in the sparsity pattern
    // that are required for the elimination of the constraint.

    // Finally, once we have the full pattern, we can initialize an object of
    // type <code>SparsityPattern</code> from it and in turn initialize the
    // matrix with it. Note that this is actually necessary, since the
    // <code>CompressedSparsityPattern</code> is so inefficient compared to
    // the <code>SparsityPattern</code> class due to the more flexible data
    // structures it has to use, that we can impossibly base the sparse matrix
    // class on it, but rather need an object of type
    // <code>SparsityPattern</code>, which we generate by copying from the
    // intermediate object.
    //
    // As a further sidenote, you will notice that we do not explicitly have
    // to <code>compress</code> the sparsity pattern here. This, of course, is
    // due to the fact that the <code>copy_from</code> function generates a
    // compressed object right from the start, to which you cannot add new
    // entries anymore. The <code>compress</code> call is therefore implicit
    // in the <code>copy_from</code> call.

  // whole library. But let's look at each of the steps.

  {

    // First, we have to assemble the matrix and the right hand side. In all
    // previous examples, we have investigated various ways how to do this
    // manually. However, since the Laplace matrix and simple right hand sides
    // appear so frequently in applications, the library provides functions
    // for actually doing this for you, i.e. they perform the loop over all
    // cells, setting up the local matrices and vectors, and putting them
    // together for the end result.
    //
    // The following are the two most commonly used ones: creation of the
    // Laplace matrix and creation of a right hand side vector from body or
    // boundary forces. They take the mapping object, the
    // <code>DoFHandler</code> object representing the degrees of freedom and
    // the finite element in use, a quadrature formula to be used, and the
    // output object. The function that creates a right hand side vector also
    // has to take a function object describing the (continuous) right hand
    // side function.
    //
    // Let us look at the way the matrix and body forces are integrated:
    const unsigned int gauss_degree
      = std::max (static_cast<unsigned int>(std::ceil(1.*(mapping.get_degree()+1)/2)),
                  2U);

                                        QGauss<dim>(gauss_degree),
                                        system_matrix);
    VectorTools::create_right_hand_side (mapping, dof_handler,
                                         QGauss<dim>(gauss_degree),
                                         ConstantFunction<dim>(-2),
                                         system_rhs);
    // That's quite simple, right?
    //
    // Two remarks are in order, though: First, these functions are used in a
    // lot of contexts. Maybe you want to create a Laplace or mass matrix for
    // a vector values finite element; or you want to use the default Q1
    // mapping; or you want to assembled the matrix with a coefficient in the
    // Laplace operator. For this reason, there are quite a large number of
    // variants of these functions in the <code>MatrixCreator</code> and
    // <code>MatrixTools</code> classes. Whenever you need a slightly
    // different version of these functions than the ones called above, it is
    // certainly worthwhile to take a look at the documentation and to check
    // whether something fits your needs.
    //
    // The second remark concerns the quadrature formula we use: we want to
    // integrate over bilinear shape functions, so we know that we have to use
    // at least a Gauss2 quadrature formula. On the other hand, we want to
    // have the quadrature rule to have at least the order of the boundary
    // approximation. Since the order of Gauss-r is 2r, and the order of the
    // boundary approximation using polynomials of degree p is p+1, we know
    // that 2r@>=p+1. Since r has to be an integer and (as mentioned above)
    // has to be at least 2, this makes up for the formula above computing
    // <code>gauss_degree</code>.
    //
    // Since the generation of the body force contributions to the right hand
    // side vector was so simple, we do that all over again for the boundary
    // forces as well: allocate a vector of the right size and call the right
    // function. The boundary function has constant values, so we can generate
    // an object from the library on the fly, and we use the same quadrature
    // formula as above, but this time of lower dimension since we integrate
    // over faces now instead of cells:
    Vector<double> tmp (system_rhs.size());
    VectorTools::create_boundary_right_hand_side (mapping, dof_handler,
                                                  QGauss<dim-1>(gauss_degree),
                                                  ConstantFunction<dim>(1),
                                                  tmp);
    // Then add the contributions from the boundary to those from the interior
    // of the domain:
    system_rhs += tmp;
    // For assembling the right hand side, we had to use two different vector
    // objects, and later add them together. The reason we had to do so is
    // that the <code>VectorTools::create_right_hand_side</code> and
    // <code>VectorTools::create_boundary_right_hand_side</code> functions
    // first clear the output vector, rather than adding up their results to
    // previous contents. This can reasonably be called a design flaw in the
    // library made in its infancy, but unfortunately things are as they are
    // for some time now and it is difficult to change such things that
    // silently break existing code, so we have to live with that.

    // Now, the linear system is set up, so we can eliminate the one degree of
    // freedom which we constrained to the other DoFs on the boundary for the
    // mean value constraint from matrix and right hand side vector, and solve
    // the system. After that, distribute the constraints again, which in this
    // case means setting the constrained degree of freedom to its proper
    // value

    // Finally, evaluate what we got as solution. As stated in the
    // introduction, we are interested in the H1 semi-norm of the
    // solution. Here, as well, we have a function in the library that does
    // this, although in a slightly non-obvious way: the
    // <code>VectorTools::integrate_difference</code> function integrates the
    // norm of the difference between a finite element function and a
    // continuous function. If we therefore want the norm of a finite element
    // field, we just put the continuous function to zero. Note that this
    // function, just as so many other ones in the library as well, has at
    // least two versions, one which takes a mapping as argument (which we
    // make us of here), and the one which we have used in previous examples
    // which implicitly uses <code>MappingQ1</code>.  Also note that we take a
    // quadrature formula of one degree higher, in order to avoid
    // superconvergence effects where the solution happens to be especially
    // close to the exact solution at certain points (we don't know whether
    // this might be the case here, but there are cases known of this, and we
