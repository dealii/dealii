// The following, however, will be new or be used in new roles. Let's walk
// through them. The first of these will provide the tools of the
// Utilities::System namespace that we will use to query things like the
// number of processors associated with the current MPI universe, or the
// number within this universe the processor this job runs on is:
#include <deal.II/base/utilities.h>
// The next one provides a class, ConditionOStream that allows us to write
// code that would output things to a stream (such as <code>std::cout</code>
// on every processor but throws the text away on all but one of them. We
// could achieve the same by simply putting an <code>if</code> statement in
// front of each place where we may generate output, but this doesn't make the
// code any prettier. In addition, the condition whether this processor should
// or should not produce output to the screen is the same every time -- and
// consequently it should be simple enough to put it into the statements that
// generate output itself.
#include <deal.II/base/conditional_ostream.h>
// After these preliminaries, here is where it becomes more interesting. As
// mentioned in the @ref distributed module, one of the fundamental truths of
// solving problems on large numbers of processors is that there is no way for
// any processor to store everything (e.g. information about all cells in the
// mesh, all degrees of freedom, or the values of all elements of the solution
// vector). Rather, every processor will <i>own</i> a few of each of these
// and, if necessary, may <i>know</i> about a few more, for example the ones
// that are located on cells adjacent to the ones this processor owns
// itself. We typically call the latter <i>ghost cells</i>, <i>ghost nodes</i>
// or <i>ghost elements of a vector</i>. The point of this discussion here is
// that we need to have a way to indicate which elements a particular
// processor owns or need to know of. This is the realm of the IndexSet class:
// if there are a total of $N$ cells, degrees of freedom, or vector elements,
// associated with (non-negative) integral indices $[0,N)$, then both the set
// of elements the current processor owns as well as the (possibly larger) set
// of indices it needs to know about are subsets of the set $[0,N)$. IndexSet
// is a class that stores subsets of this set in an efficient format:
#include <deal.II/base/index_set.h>
// The next header file is necessary for a single function,
// SparsityTools::distribute_sparsity_pattern. The role of this function will
// be explained below.
#include <deal.II/lac/sparsity_tools.h>
// The final two, new header files provide the class
// parallel::distributed::Triangulation that provides meshes distributed
// across a potentially very large number of processors, while the second
// provides the namespace parallel::distributed::GridRefinement that offers
// functions that can adaptively refine such distributed meshes:

  // Next let's declare the main class of this program. Its structure is
  // almost exactly that of the step-6 tutorial program. The only significant
  // differences are:
  // - The <code>mpi_communicator</code> variable that
  //   describes the set of processors we want this code to run on. In practice,
  //   this will be MPI_COMM_WORLD, i.e. all processors the batch scheduling
  //   system has assigned to this particular job.
  // - The presence of the <code>pcout</code> variable of type ConditionOStream.
  // - The obvious use of parallel::distributed::Triangulation instead of
  // Triangulation.
  // - The presence of two IndexSet objects that denote which sets of degrees of
  //   freedom (and associated elements of solution and right hand side vectors)
  //   we own on the current processor and which we need (as ghost elements) for
  //   the algorithms in this program to work.
  // - The fact that all matrices and vectors are now distributed. We use
  //   either the PETSc or Trilinos wrapper classes so that we can use one of
  //   the sophisticated preconditioners offered by Hypre (with PETSc) or ML
  //   (with Trilinos). Note that as part of this class, we store a solution
  //   vector that does not only contain the degrees of freedom the current
  //   processor owns, but also (as ghost elements) all those vector elements
  //   that correspond to "locally relevant" degrees of freedom (i.e. all

  // @sect4{LaplaceProblem::assemble_system}

  // The function that then assembles the linear system is comparatively
  // boring, being almost exactly what we've seen before. The points to watch
  // out for are:
  // - Assembly must only loop over locally owned cells. There
  //   are multiple ways to test that; for example, we could compare a cell's
  //   subdomain_id against information from the triangulation as in
  //   <code>cell->subdomain_id() ==
  //   triangulation.locally_owned_subdomain()</code>, or skip all cells for
  //   which the condition <code>cell->is_ghost() ||
  //   cell->is_artificial()</code> is true. The simplest way, however, is to
  //   simply ask the cell whether it is owned by the local processor.
  // - Copying local contributions into the global matrix must include
  //   distributing constraints and boundary values. In other words, we cannot
  //   (as we did in step-6) first copy every local contribution into the global
  //   matrix and only in a later step take care of hanging node constraints and
  //   boundary values. The reason is, as discussed in step-17, that the
  //   parallel vector classes do not provide access to arbitrary elements of
  //   the matrix once they have been assembled into it -- in parts because they
  //   may simply no longer reside on the current processor but have instead
  //   been shipped to a different machine.
  // - The way we compute the right hand side (given the
  //   formula stated in the introduction) may not be the most elegant but will
  //   do for a program whose focus lies somewhere entirely different.

  // @sect4{LaplaceProblem::solve}

  // Even though solving linear systems on potentially tens of thousands of
  // processors is by far not a trivial job, the function that does this is --
  // at least at the outside -- relatively simple. Most of the parts you've
  // seen before. There are really only two things worth mentioning:
  // - Solvers and preconditioners are built on the deal.II wrappers of PETSc
  //   and Trilinos functionality. It is relatively well known that the
  //   primary bottleneck of massively %parallel linear solvers is not
  //   actually the communication between processors, but the fact that it is
  //   difficult to produce preconditioners that scale well to large numbers
  //   of processors. Over the second half of the first decade of the 21st
  //   century, it has become clear that algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods
  //   turn out to be extremely efficient in this context, and we will use one
  //   of them -- either the BoomerAMG implementation of the Hypre package
  //   that can be interfaced to through PETSc, or a preconditioner provided
  //   by ML, which is part of Trilinos -- for the current program. The rest
  //   of the solver itself is boilerplate and has been shown before. Since
  //   the linear system is symmetric and positive definite, we can use the CG
  //   method as the outer solver.
  // - Ultimately, we want a vector that stores not only the elements
  //   of the solution for degrees of freedom the current processor owns, but
  //   also all other locally relevant degrees of freedom. On the other hand,
  //   the solver itself needs a vector that is uniquely split between
  //   processors, without any overlap. We therefore create a vector at the
  //   beginning of this function that has these properties, use it to solve the
  //   linear system, and only assign it to the vector we want at the very
  //   end. This last step ensures that all ghost elements are also copied as

  // @sect4{LaplaceProblem::output_results}

  // Compared to the corresponding function in step-6, the one here is a tad
  // more complicated. There are two reasons: the first one is that we do not
  // just want to output the solution but also for each cell which processor
  // owns it (i.e. which "subdomain" it is in). Secondly, as discussed at
  // length in step-17 and step-18, generating graphical data can be a
  // bottleneck in parallelizing. In step-18, we have moved this step out of
  // the actual computation but shifted it into a separate program that later
  // combined the output from various processors into a single file. But this
  // doesn't scale: if the number of processors is large, this may mean that
  // the step of combining data on a single processor later becomes the
  // longest running part of the program, or it may produce a file that's so
  // large that it can't be visualized any more. We here follow a more
  // sensible approach, namely creating individual files for each MPI process
  // and leaving it to the visualization program to make sense of that.
  //
  // To start, the top of the function looks like it usually does. In addition
  // to attaching the solution vector (the one that has entries for all locally
  // relevant, not only the locally owned, elements), we attach a data vector
  // that stores, for each cell, the subdomain the cell belongs to. This is
  // slightly tricky, because of course not every processor knows about every
  // cell. The vector we attach therefore has an entry for every cell that the
  // current processor has in its mesh (locally owned ones, ghost cells, and
  // artificial cells), but the DataOut class will ignore all entries that
  // correspond to cells that are not owned by the current processor. As a
  // consequence, it doesn't actually matter what values we write into these
  // vector entries: we simply fill the entire vector with the number of the
  // current MPI process (i.e. the subdomain_id of the current process); this
  // correctly sets the values we care for, i.e. the entries that correspond
  // to locally owned cells, while providing the wrong value for all other
  // elements -- but these are then ignored anyway.

  // at most 32 processors are involved. Without this limit, it would be just

  // first to bring down the cluster interconnect and fill any file system
  // available :-)

  // just isn't much of a point showing a massively %parallel program starting

// The final function, <code>main()</code>, again has the same structure as in

// MPI, we have to initialize and finalize MPI, which is done using the helper
// object Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize. The constructor of that class also
// initializes libraries that depend on MPI, such as p4est, PETSc, SLEPc, and
// Zoltan (though the last two are not used in this tutorial). The order here
// is important: we cannot use any of these libraries until they are
// initialized, so it does not make sense to do anything before creating an
// instance of Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize.
//
// After the solver finishes, the LaplaceProblem destructor will run followed
// by Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize::~MPI_InitFinalize(). This order is
// also important: Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize::~MPI_InitFinalize() calls
// <code>PetscFinalize</code> (and finalization functions for other
// libraries), which will delete any in-use PETSc objects. This must be done
// after we destruct the Laplace solver to avoid double deletion
// errors. Fortunately, due to the order of destructor call rules of C++, we
// do not need to worry about any of this: everything happens in the correct
// order (i.e., the reverse of the order of construction). The last function
// called by Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize::~MPI_InitFinalize() is
// <code>MPI_Finalize</code>: i.e., once this object is destructed the program
// should exit since MPI will no longer be available.
