# Work around an issue where gcc emits a note that the warning
# -Wmisleading-indentation will be disabled due to a humongous line of over
# 100k characters produced by one of the CGAL headers. Unfortunately,
# guarding the include by DEAL_II_DISABLE_EXTRA_DIAGNOSTICS is not enough
# due to a longstanding bug in gcc. Thus, simply set
# -Wno-misleading-indentation on the command line for the
# grid_generator_cgal.cc compilation unit.
