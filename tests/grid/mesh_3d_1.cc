// the real reason why coarsening_3d failed: take three cells to form an
// L, and we end up with an external face between two of them, which
// however has edges that are shared by the two cells. this creates a
// major upheaval in the data structures later on (as testified by
// coarsening_3d), but we can check this fact much earlier already (done
// here)
