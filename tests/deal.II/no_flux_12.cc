// The problem comes down to this: The domain (a box with a cylinder
// through it) is discretized with eight cells that go around the
// perimeter of the cylinder and are extruded to full height in
// z-direction. In particular, for the top and bottom surfaces, there
// is a cell edge from the circle to the corners of the top and bottom
// outer squares (as well as an edge from the circle to the midpoints
// of the sides of the squares).
//
// now, we try to compute the boundary conditions for no normal flux
// with a set of boundary indicators that includes the top part of the
// domain plus one of the four outer sides of the box. consider what
// happens at one of the vertices of the box that are part of both the
// top and the selected side: there, one of the eight cells of the
// mesh contributes two normal vectors (one from its top face and from
// its "side" face) but since at each of the eight vertices of the box
// two cells come together, there is also a cell that contributes only
// one normal vector (because it has one face at the top surface, but
// its other outer face does not have a selected boundary
// indicator). we used to be unable to deal with this situation where
// one cell contributed twice and another only once. this has been
// fixed now by simply ignoring the one that contributes only once.
