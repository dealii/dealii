// for surfaces, we need some sort of mapping also for interior cells
// and faces, but at the time of writing this, we can only set
// boundary_indicators of faces and edges that are truly at the
// boundary of the domain. to work around this, we use the material_id
// field that one can set on cells, and copy it also to the adjacent
// faces. initially, however, we also copied the material_id to the
// boundary_indicator of adjacent faces that truly were at the
// boundary of the domain, and which might have had something
// purposefully set already
//
// this test verifies that this is now fixed.
