// DataOut::build_patches appeared to have a problem with outputting
// lines in 2d where nodes were numbered differently when writing data
// vectors as opposed to writing node locations. in the end this
// turned out to be a feature: the mesh was a circle of lines, so
// there are equally many cells as their were nodes, and consequently
// DataOut assumed that it had cell_data, rather than
// dof_data. passing the correct argument fixed the problem, but it
// won't hurt to have this test anyway.
