// Trilinos ML is non-deterministic up to Trilinos 12.4 and then only when the
// random seed is initialized correctly. This test checks this. Like _01 but
// using our deal.II data structures.

// Note that we need to increase the size of the matrix to be >2000 from
// amg_nondeterministic_01, otherwise the default settings will just apply the
// coarse solver due to the default settings.
