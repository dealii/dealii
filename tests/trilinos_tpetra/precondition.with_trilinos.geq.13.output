DEAL:01089:CustomIGLOO::Error: 
    You tried to select the preconditioner type <IGLOO>
but this preconditioner is not supported by Trilinos/Ifpack22
due to one of the following reasons:
* This preconditioner does not exist
* This preconditioner has a specialized constructor not supported by the Ifpack2 Factory.
* This preconditioner is not (yet) supported by Trilinos/Ifpack2
* Trilinos/Ifpack2 was not configured for its use.
