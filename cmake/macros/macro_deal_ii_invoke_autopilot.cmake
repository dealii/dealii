# This file implements the DEAL_II_INVOKE_AUTOPILOT macro, which is
# part of the deal.II library.
#
# Usage:
#       DEAL_II_INVOKE_AUTOPILOT()
#
# where it is assumed that the following variables are defined:
#
#       TARGET         -  a string used for the project and target name
#       TARGET_SRC     -  a list of source file to compile for target
#                         ${TARGET}
#       TARGET_RUN     -  (optional) the command line that should be
#                         invoked by "make run", will be set to default
#                         values if undefined. If no run target should be
#                         created, set it to an empty string.
#       CLEAN_UP_FILES -  (optional) a list of files (globs) that will be
#                         removed with "make runclean" and "make
#                         distclean", will be set to default values if
#                         empty
#
