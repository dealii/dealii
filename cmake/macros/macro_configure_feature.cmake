#
# This macro is used for the feature configuration in deal.II
#
# Usage:
#     CONFIGURE_FEATURE(feature)
#
#
# This macro uses the following optional variables and macros:
#
# FEATURE_${feature}_DEPENDS    (a variable)
#    a variable which contains an optional list of other features
#    this feature depends on (and which have to be enbled for this feature
#    to work.)
#    Features must be given with short name, i.e. without DEAL_II_WITH_
#
# FEATURE_${feature}_after      (a variable)
#    a variable which contains an optional list of other features
#    that have to be configured prior to this feature
#    Features must be given with short name, i.e. without DEAL_II_WITH_
#
# FEATURE_${feature}_HAVE_BUNDLED   (a variable)
#    which should either be set to TRUE if all necessary libraries of the
#    features comes bundled with deal.II and hence can be supported
#    without external dependencies, or unset.
#
# FEATURE_${feature}_CONFIGURE_BUNDLED()   (a macro)
#    which should setup all necessary configuration for the feature with
#    bundled source dependencies. If something goes wrong this macro must
#    issue a FATAL_ERROR.
#
# FEATURE_${feature}_FIND_EXTERNAL(var)   (a macro)
#    which should set var to TRUE if all dependencies for the feature are
#    fullfilled. In this case all necessary variables for
#    FEATURE_${feature}_CONFIGURE_EXTERNAL must be set. Otherwise
#    var should remain unset.
#    If not defined, FIND_PACKAGE(${feature}) is called.
#
# FEATURE_${feature}_CONFIGURE_EXTERNAL()   (macro)
#    which should setup all necessary configuration for the feature with
#    external dependencies.
#
# FEATURE_${feature}_ERROR_MESSAGE()  (macro)
#    which should print a meaningfull error message (with FATAL_ERROR) for
#    the case that no usable library was found.
#    If not defined, a suitable default error message will be printed.
