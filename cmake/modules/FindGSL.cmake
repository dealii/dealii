# OK... It could be all so easy by just calling FindGSL.cmake (shipped with
# CMake around 3.2 onwards). Unfortunately this module sets up imported
# targets for the library it found (a feature). Unfortunately, portions of
# the target information seem to be cached and are thus incompatible with
# our notion of disabling and clearing a feature *sigh*.
#
# Further we support CMake from version 2.8.8 onwards and would have to do
# the manual work anyway.
