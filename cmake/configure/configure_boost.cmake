  # Boost version 1.62 - 1.63 checks for the availability of "emplace_hint"
  # incorrectly: It tests for the preprocessor define
  # BOOST_NO_CXX11_HDR_UNORDERED_MAP in .../boost/serialization/map.h
  # thinking that that this define is characteristic for the presence of
  # std::(multi)map::emplace_hint. This is generally correct, except for
  # GCC before 4.8, for which the preprocessor variable is defined, but the
  # function does not exist [1].
  #
  # Thus, simply define a BOOST_NO_CXX11_HDR_UNORDERED_MAP if the gcc
  # compiler version is less than 4.8.
