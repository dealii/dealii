# This is a small worker to run a single test in the testsuite
#
# The following variables must be set:
#
#   TRGT - the name of the target that should be invoked
#   TEST - the test name (used for status messages)
#   BINARY_DIR - the build directory that contains the target
#
# Optional options:
#   EXPECT - the stage this test must reach to be considered successful
#            (return value 0)
#            Possible values are CONFIGURE, BUILD, RUN, DIFF, PASSED
#
#   GUARD_FILE - used to detect a forced interruption of this script: On
#                startup the backed up file ${GUARD_FILE}_bck is put back
#                in place as ${GUARD_FILE} and on exit ${GUARD_FILE} is
#                backed up as ${GUARD_FILE}_bck. If on startup a stale
#                ${GUARD_FILE} is found, it is deleted.
