This is a shell with PATHs and \${EXTERNAL_LIB}_DIR setup to work with Deal.II.
All external libraries are located in 

    $DEAL_II_RESOURCES/@DEAL_II_CPACK_EXTERNAL_LIBS@/

If you are new to Deal.II you probably want to have a look at

    $DEAL_II_RESOURCES/examples/

If you want to set up your daily Terminal to work with deal.II, add
these lines to your ~/.profile file (the first line turns off this message):

   export DEAL_II_CONF_SILENT=ON
   . $DEAL_II_RESOURCES/@DEAL_II_SHARE_RELDIR@/dealii.conf
