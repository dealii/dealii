/**
 * Collection of functions controlling refinement and coarsening of

 * The functions in this namespace form two categories. There are the
 * auxiliary functions refine() and coarsen(). More important for users are
 * the other functions, which implement refinement strategies, as being found
 * in the literature on adaptive finite element methods. For mathematical
 * discussion of these methods, consider works by D&ouml;rfler, Morin,
 * Nochetto, Rannacher, Stevenson and many more.

  /**
   * This function provides a refinement strategy with predictable growth of
   * the mesh.
   *
   * The function takes a vector of refinement @p criteria and two values
   * between zero and one denoting the fractions of cells to be refined and
   * coarsened. It flags cells for further processing by
   * Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement() according to the
   * following greedy algorithm:
   *
   * <ol>
   *
   * <li> Sort the cells according to descending values of @p criteria.
   *
   * <li> Set the refinement threshold to be the criterion belonging to the
   * cell at position @p top_fraction_of_cells times
   * Triangulation::n_active_cells().
   *
   * <li> Set the coarsening threshold accordingly using the cell @p
   * bottom_fraction_of_cells times Triangulation::n_active_cells() from the
   * end of the sorted list.
   *
   * <li> Use these two thresholds in calls to refine() and coarsen(),
   * respectively.
   *
   * </ol>
   *
   * As an example, with no coarsening, setting @p top_fraction_of_cells to
   * 1/3 will result in approximately doubling the number of cells in two
   * dimensions. The same effect in three dimensions is achieved by refining
   * 1/7th of the cells. These values are good initial guesses, but should be
   * adjusted depending on the singularity of approximated function.
   *
   * The sorting of criteria is not done actually, since we only need the
   * threshold values in order to call refine() and coarsen(). The order of
   * cells with higher and of those with lower criteria is irrelevant. Getting
   * this value is accomplished by the @p nth_element function of the
   * <tt>C++</tt> standard library, which takes only linear time in the number
   * of elements, rather than <tt>N log N</tt> for sorting all values.
   *
   * @warning This function only sets the coarsening and refinement flags. The
   * mesh is not changed until you call
   * Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement().
   *
   * @arg @p criteria: the refinement criterion computed on each mesh cell.
   * Entries may not be negative.
   *
   * @arg @p top_fraction_of_cells is the fraction of cells to be refined. If
   * this number is zero, no cells will be refined. If it equals one, the
   * result will be flagging for global refinement.
   *
   * @arg @p bottom_fraction_of_cells is the fraction of cells to be
   * coarsened. If this number is zero, no cells will be coarsened.
   *
   * @arg @p max_n_cells can be used to specify a maximal number of cells. If
   * this number is going to be exceeded upon refinement, then refinement and
   * coarsening fractions are going to be adjusted in an attempt to reach the
   * maximum number of cells. Be aware though that through proliferation of
   * refinement due to Triangulation::MeshSmoothing, this number is only an
   * indicator. The default value of this argument is to impose no limit on
   * the number of cells.

   * This function provides a refinement strategy controlling the reduction of

   *
   * Also known as the <b>bulk criterion</b>, this function computes the
   * thresholds for refinement and coarsening such that the @p criteria of
   * cells getting flagged for refinement make up for a certain fraction of
   * the total error. We explain its operation for refinement, coarsening
   * works analogously.
   *
   * Let <i>c<sub>K</sub></i> be the criterion of cell <i>K</i>. Then the
   * total error estimate is computed by the formula
   * @f[
   * E = \sum_{K\in \cal T} c_K.

   * @f]
   *
   * The algorithm is performed by the greedy algorithm described in

   *
   * @note The often used formula with squares on the left and right is
   * recovered by actually storing the square of <i>c<sub>K</sub></i> in the

   *
   * From the point of view of implementation, this time we really need to

  /**
   * Refine the triangulation by flagging certain cells to reach a grid that
   * is optimal with respect to an objective function that tries to balance
   * reducing the error and increasing the numerical cost when the mesh is
   * refined. Specifically, this function makes the assumption that if you
   * refine a cell $K$ with error indicator $\eta_K$ provided by the second
   * argument to this function, then the error on the children (for all
   * children together) will only be $2^{-\text{order}}\eta_K$ where
   * <code>order</code> is the third argument of this function. This makes the
   * assumption that the error is only a local property on a mesh and can be
   * reduced by local refinement -- an assumption that is true for the
   * interpolation operator, but not for the usual Galerkin projection,
   * although it is approximately true for elliptic problems where the Greens
   * function decays quickly and the error here is not too much affected by a
   * too coarse mesh somewhere else.
   *
   * With this, we can define the objective function this function tries to
   * optimize. Let us assume that the mesh currently has $N_0$ cells. Then, if
   * we refine the $m$ cells with the largest errors, we expect to get (in $d$
   * space dimensions)
   * @f[
   *   N(m) = (N_0-m) + 2^d m = N_0 + (2^d-1)m
   * @f]
   * cells ($N_0-m$ are not refined, and each of the $m$ cells we refine yield
   * $2^d$ child cells. On the other hand, with refining $m$ cells, and using
   * the assumptions above, we expect that the error will be
   * @f[
   *   \eta^\text{exp}(m)
   *   =
   *   \sum_{K, K\; \text{will not be refined}} \eta_K
   *   +
   *   \sum_{K, K\; \text{will be refined}} 2^{-\text{order}}\eta_K
   * @f]
   * where the first sum extends over $N_0-m$ cells and the second over the
   * $m$ cells that will be refined. Note that $N(m)$ is an increasing
   * function of $m$ whereas $\eta^\text{exp}(m)$ is a decreasing function.
   *
   * This function then tries to find that number $m$ of cells to refine for
   * which the objective function
   * @f[
   *   J(m) = N(m)^{\text{order}/d} \eta^\text{exp}(m)
   * @f]
   * is minimal.
   *
   * The rationale for this function is two-fold. First, compared to the
   * refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction() and refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number()
   * functions, this function has the property that if all refinement
   * indicators are the same (i.e., we have achieved a mesh where the error
   * per cell is equilibrated), then the entire mesh is refined. This is based
   * on the observation that a mesh with equilibrated error indicators is the
   * optimal mesh (i.e., has the least overall error) among all meshes with
   * the same number of cells. (For proofs of this, see R. Becker, M. Braack,
   * R. Rannacher: "Numerical simulation of laminar flames at low Mach number
   * with adaptive finite elements", Combustion Theory and Modelling, Vol. 3,
   * Nr. 3, p. 503-534 1999; and W. Bangerth, R. Rannacher: "Adaptive Finite
   * Element Methods for Differential Equations", Birkhauser, 2003.)
   *
   * Second, the function uses the observation that ideally, the error behaves
   * like $e \approx c N^{-\alpha}$ with some constant $\alpha$ that depends
   * on the dimension and the finite element degree. It should - given optimal
   * mesh refinement - not depend so much on the regularity of the solution,
   * as it is based on the idea, that all singularities can be resolved by
   * refinement. Mesh refinement is then based on the idea that we want to
   * make $c=e N^\alpha$ small. This corresponds to the functional $J(m)$
   * above.
   *
   * @note This function was originally implemented by Thomas Richter. It
   * follows a strategy described in T. Richter, "Parallel Multigrid Method
   * for Adaptive Finite Elements with Application to 3D Flow Problems", PhD
   * thesis, University of Heidelberg, 2005. See in particular Section 4.3,
   * pp. 42-43.
