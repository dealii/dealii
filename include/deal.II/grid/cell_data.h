/**
 * The CellData class (and the related SubCellData class) is used to
 * provide a comprehensive, but minimal, description of the cells when
 * creating a triangulation via Triangulation::create_triangulation().
 * Specifically, each CellData object -- describing one cell in a
 * triangulation -- has member variables for indices of the $2^d$ vertices
 * (the actual coordinates of the vertices are described in a separate
 * vector passed to Triangulation::create_triangulation(), so the CellData
 * object only needs to store indices into that vector), the material
 * id of the cell that can be used in applications to describe which
 * part of the domain a cell belongs to (see
 * @ref GlossMaterialId "the glossary entry on material ids"),
 * and a manifold id that is used to describe the geometry object
 * that is responsible for this cell (see
 * @ref GlossManifoldIndicator "the glossary entry on manifold ids")
 * to describe the manifold this object belongs to.
 *
 * This structure is also used to represent data for faces and edges when used
 * as a member of the SubCellData class. In this case, the template argument
 * @p structdim of an object will be less than the dimension @p dim of the
 * triangulation. If this is so, then #vertices array represents the indices of
 * the vertices of one face or edge of one of the cells passed to
 * Triangulation::create_triangulation(). Furthermore, for faces the
 * material id has no meaning, and the @p material_id field is reused
 * to store a @p boundary_id instead to designate which part of the boundary
 * the face or edge belongs to (see
 * @ref GlossBoundaryIndicator "the glossary entry on boundary ids").
 *
 * An example showing how this class can be used is in the
 * <code>create_coarse_grid()</code> function of step-14. There are also
 * many more use cases in the implementation of the functions of the
 * GridGenerator namespace.

/**
 * The SubCellData class is used to describe information about faces and
 * edges at the boundary of a mesh when creating a triangulation via
 * Triangulation::create_triangulation(). It contains member variables
 * that describe boundary edges and boundary quads.
 *
 * The class has no template argument and is used both in the description
 * of boundary edges in 2d (in which case the contents of the
 * @p boundary_quads member variable are ignored), as well as in the
 * description of boundary edges and faces in 3d (in which case both the
 * @p boundary_lines and @p boundary_quads members may be used). It is also
 * used as the argument to Triangulation::create_triangulation() in 1d,
 * where the contents of objects of the current type are simply ignored.
 *
 * By default, Triangulation::create_triangulation() simply assigns
 * default boundary indicators and manifold indicators to edges and
 * quads at the boundary of the mesh. (See the glossary entries on
 * @ref GlossBoundaryIndicator "boundary ids"
 * and
 * @ref GlossManifoldIndicator "manifold ids"
 * for more information on what they represent.) As a consequence,
 * it is not <i>necessary</i> to explicitly describe the properties
 * of boundary objects. In all cases, these properties can also be
 * set at a later time, once the triangulation has already been
 * created. On the other hand, it is sometimes convenient to describe
 * boundary indicators or manifold ids at the time of creation. In
 * these cases, the current class can be used by filling the
 * @p boundary_lines and @p boundary_quads vectors with
 * CellData<1> and CellData<2> objects that correspond to boundary
 * edges and quads for which properties other than the default
 * values should be used.
 *
 * Each entry in the @p boundary_lines and @p boundary_quads vectors
 * then needs to correspond to an edge or quad of the cells that
 * are described by the vector of CellData objects passed to
 * Triangulation::create_triangulation(). I.e., the vertex indices
 * stored in each entry need to correspond to an edge or face
 * of the triangulation that has the same set of vertex indices,
 * and in the same order. For these boundary edges or quads, one can
 * then set either or both the CellData::boundary_id and
 * CellData::manifold_id.
 *
 * There are also use cases where one may want to set the manifold id
 * of an <i>interior</i> edge or face. Such faces, identified by
 * their vertex indices, may also appear in the
 * @p boundary_lines and @p boundary_quads vectors (despite the names of
 * these member variables). However, it is then obviously not allowed
 * to set a boundary id (because the object is not actually part of
 * the boundary). As a consequence, to be valid, the CellData::boundary_id
 * of interior edges or faces needs to equal
 * numbers::internal_face_boundary_id.
