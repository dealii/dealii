/**
 * Manifolds are used to describe the geometry of boundaries of domains as
 * well as the geometry of the interior. Manifold objects are therefore
 * associated with cells, faces, and/or edges, either by direct user action
 * or, if a user program does not do this explicitly, a default manifold
 * object is used.
 *
 * Manifolds are best understood by using the language of differential
 * geometry, but their common uses can be easily described simply through
 * examples.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Common use case: Creating a new vertex</h3>
 *
 * In the most essential use of manifolds, manifold descriptions are used
 * to create a "point between other points". For example, when a triangulation
 * creates a new vertex on a cell, face, or edge, it determines the new
 * vertex' coordinates through the following function call:
 *   @code
 *     ...
 *     Point<spacedim> new_vertex = manifold.get_new_point (points,weights);
 *     ...
 *   @endcode
 * Here, @p points is a collection of points in @p spacedim dimension,
 * and @p a collection of corresponding weights. The points
 * in this context will then be the vertices of the cell, face, or edge, and
 * the weights are typically one over the number of points when a new midpoint
 * of the cell, face, or edge is needed. Derived classes then will implement the
 * Manifold::get_new_point() function in a way that computes the location of this
 * new point. In the simplest case, for example in the FlatManifold class, the
 * function simply computes the arithmetic average (with given weights) of
 * the given points. However, other classes do something differently; for example,
 * the SphericalManifold class, which is used to describe domains that form (part of) the
 * sphere, will ensure that, given the two vertices of an edge at
 * the boundary, the new returned point will lie on the grand circle that connects
 * the two points, rather than choosing a point that is half-way between the
 * two points in ${\mathbb R}^d$.
 *
 *
 * @note Unlike almost all other cases in the library, we here interpret the points
 * to be in real space, not on the reference cell.
 *
 * Manifold::get_new_point() has a default implementation that can
 * simplify this process somewhat: Internally, the function calls the
 * Manifold::get_intermediate_point() to compute pair-wise
 * intermediate points. Internally the
 * Manifold::get_intermediate_point() calls the
 * Manifold::project_to_manifold() function after computing the convex
 * conbination of the given points.  This allows derived classes to
 * only overload Manifold::project_to_manifold() for simple
 * situations. This is often useful when describing manifolds that are
 * embedded in higher dimensional space, e.g., the surface of a
 * sphere.  In those cases, the desired new point may be computed
 * simply by the (weighted) average of the provided points, projected
 * back out onto the sphere.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Common use case: Computing tangent vectors</h3>
 *
 * The second use of this class is in computing directions on domains and
 * boundaries. For example, we may need to compute the normal vector to a
 * face in order to impose the no-flow boundary condition
 * $\mathbf u \cdot \mathbf n = 0$ (see the
 * VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints() as an example). Similarly,
 * we may need normal vectors in the computation of the normal component of
 * the gradient of the numerical solution in order to compute the jump in the
 * gradient of the solution in error estimators (see, for example, the
 * KellyErrorEstimator class).
 *
 * To make this possible, the Manifold class provides a member function
 * (to be implemented by derived classes) that computes a "vector tangent
 * to the manifold at one point, in direction of another point" via the
 * Manifold::get_tangent_vector() function. For example, in 2d, one would
 * use this function with the two vertices of an edge at the boundary
 * to compute a "tangential" vector along the edge, and then get the normal
 * vector by rotation by 90 degrees. In 3d, one would compute the two
 * vectors "tangential" to the two edges of a boundary face adjacent to a
 * boundary vertex, and then take the cross product of these two to
 * obtain a vector normal to the boundary.
 *
 * For reasons that are more
 * difficult to understand, these direction vectors are normalized in a very
 * specific way, rather than to have unit norm. See the documentation of
 * Manifold::get_tangent_vector(), as well as below, for more information.
 *
 * In the simplest case (namely, the FlatManifold class), these tangent
 * vectors are just the difference vector between the two given points.
 * However, in more complicated (and more interesting) cases, the direction may
 * be different. For example, for the SphericalManifold case, if the two given
 * points lie on a common grand circle around the origin, then the tangent
 * vector will be tangential to the grand circle, rather than pointing straight
 * from one point to the other.
 *
 *
 * <h3>A unified description</h3>
 *
 * The "real" way to understand what this class does is to see it in the
 * framework of differential geometry. More specifically, differential geometry
 * is fundamentally based on the assumption that two sufficiently close points
 * are connected via a line of "shortest distance". This line is called a
 * "geodesic", and it is selected from all other lines that connect the two
 * points by the property that it is shortest if distances are measured in
 * terms of the "metric" that describes a manifold. To give examples, recall
 * that the geodesics of a flat manifold (implemented in the FlatManifold
 * class) are simply the straight lines connecting two points, whereas for
 * spherical manifolds (see the SphericalManifold class) geodesics between
 * two points of same distance are the grand circles, and are in general
 * curved lines when connecting two lines of different distance from the
 * origin.
 *
 * In the following discussion, and for the purposes of implementing the
 * current class, the concept of "metrics" that is so fundamental to
 * differential geometry is no longer of great importance to us. Rather,
 * everything can simply be described by postulating the existence of
 * geodesics connecting points on a manifold.
 *
 * Given geodesics, the operations discussed in the previous two sections
 * can be described in a more formal way. In essence, they rely on the
 * fact that we can assume that a geodesic is parameterized by a "time"
 * like variable $t$ so that $\mathbf s(t)$ describes the curve and so
 * that $\mathbf s(0)$ is the location of the first and $\mathbf s(1)$
 * the location of the second point. Furthermore, $\mathbf s(t)$ traces
 * out the geodesic at constant speed, covering equal distance in equal
 * time (as measured by the metric). Note that this parameterization
 * uses time, not arc length to denote progress along the geodesic.
 *
 * In this picture, computing a mid-point between points $\mathbf x_1$
 * and $\mathbf x_2$, with weights $w_1$ and $w_2=1-w_1$, simply
 * requires computing the point $\mathbf s(w_1)$. Computing a new
 * point as a weighted average of more than two points can be done
 * by considering pairwise geodetics, finding suitable points on
 * the geodetic between the first two points, then on the geodetic
 * between this new point and the third given point, etc.
 *
 * Likewise, the "tangential" vector described above is simply the
 * velocity vector, $\mathbf s'(t)$, evaluated at one of the end
 * points of a geodesic (i.e., at $t=0$ or $t=1$). In the case of a flat
 * manifold, the geodesic is simply the straight line connecting two points,
 * and the velocity vector is just the connecting vector in that
 * case. On the other hand, for two points on a spherical manifold,
 * the geodesic is a grand circle, and the velocity vector is
 * tangent to the spherical surface.
 *
 * Note that if we wanted to, we could use this to compute the length
 * of the geodesic that connects two points $\mathbf x_1$
 * and $\mathbf x_2$ by computing $\int_0^1 \|\mathbf s'(t)\| dt$
 * along the geodesic that connects them, but this operation will
 * not be of use to us in practice. One could also conceive
 * computing the direction vector using the "new point" operation
 * above, using the formula $\mathbf s'(0)=\lim_{w\rightarrow 0}
 * \frac{\mathbf s(w)-\mathbf s(0)}{w}$ where all we need to do
 * is compute the new point $\mathbf s(w)$ with weights $w$ and
 * $1-w$ along the geodesic connecting $\mathbf x_1$ and $\mathbf x_2$.
 * The default implementation of the function does this, by evaluating
 * the quotient for a small but finite weight $w$.
 * In practice, however, it is almost always possible to explicitly
 * compute the direction vector, i.e., without the need to numerically
 * approximate the limit process, and derived classes should do so.

   * (spacedim-dim+1)-dimensional tangent space of vectors that
   * are all both normal to the face and normal to the dim-dimensional
   * surface that lives in spacedim-dimensional space. For example,
   * think of a two-dimensional mesh that covers a two-dimensional
   * surface in three-dimensional space. In that case, each
   * face (edge) is one-dimensional, and there are two linearly independent
   * vectors that are both normal to the edge: one is normal to the
   * edge and tangent to the surface (intuitively, that would be the
   * one that points from the current cell to the neighboring one,
   * if the surface was locally flat), and the other one is rooted
   * in the edge but points perpendicular to the surface (which is
   * also perpendicular to the edge that lives within the surface).
   * Thus, because there are no obviously correct semantics for this function
   * if spacedim is greater than dim, the function will simply throw
   * an error in that situation.
   *
   * The face iterator gives an indication which face this function is
   * supposed to compute the normal vector for.  This is useful if the
   * boundary of the domain is composed of different nondifferential
   * pieces (for example when using the StraightBoundary class to
   * approximate a geometry that is completely described by the coarse
   * mesh, with piecewise (bi-)linear components between the vertices,
   * but where the boundary may have a kink at the vertices itself).
   *
   * @note In 2d, the default implementation of this function computes the
   * normal vector by taking the tangent direction from p to
   * the further one of the two vertices that make up an edge, and then
   * rotates it outward (with respect to the coordinate system of the edge)
   * by 90 degrees. In 3d, the default implementation is more
   * complicated, aiming at avoiding problems with numerical round-off
   * for points close to one of the vertices. If the point p is closer
   * to the center of the face than to any of the vertices, the
   * normal vector is computed by the cross product of the tangent
   * vectors from p to either vertex zero and one of the face (if
   * the closest vertex is either vertex two or three), or of the tangent
   * vectors from p to vertices two and three (if the closest vertex is
   * either vertex zero or one). On the other hand, if the point p
   * is closer to one of the vertices than to the center of the face,
   * then we take the cross product of the tangent vectors from p
   * to the two vertices that are adjacent to the closest one.

/**
 * This class describes mappings that can be expressed in terms of charts.
 * Specifically, this class with its template arguments describes a chart of
 * dimension chartdim, which is part of a Manifold<dim,spacedim> and is used
 * in an object of type Triangulation<dim,spacedim>:  It specializes a
 * Manifold of dimension chartdim embedded in a manifold of dimension
 * spacedim, for which you have explicit pull_back() and push_forward()
 * transformations. Its use is explained in great detail in step-53.
 *
 * This is a helper class which is useful when you have an explicit map from
 * an Euclidean space of dimension chartdim to an Euclidean space of dimension
 * spacedim which represents your manifold, i.e., when your manifold
 * $\mathcal{M}$ can be represented by a map \f[ F: \mathcal{B} \subset
 * R^{\text{chartdim}} \mapsto \mathcal{M} \subset R^{\text{spacedim}} \f]
 * (the push_forward() function) and that admits the inverse transformation
 * \f[ F^{-1}: \mathcal{M} \subset R^{\text{spacedim}} \mapsto \mathcal{B}
 * \subset R^{\text{chartdim}} \f] (the pull_back() function).
 *
 * The get_new_point() function of the ChartManifold class is implemented by
 * calling the pull_back() method for all <tt>surrounding_points</tt>,
 * computing their weighted average in the chartdim Euclidean space, and
 * calling the push_forward() method with the resulting point, i.e., \f[
 * \mathbf x^{\text{new}} = F(\sum_i w_i F^{-1}(\mathbf x_i)).  \f]
 *
 * Derived classes are required to implement the push_forward() and the
 * pull_back() methods. All other functions (with the exception of the
 * push_forward_gradient() function, see below) that are required by mappings
 * will then be provided by this class.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Providing function gradients</h3>
 *
 * In order to compute vectors that are tangent to the manifold (for example,
 * tangent to a surface embedded in higher dimensional space, or simply the
 * three unit vectors of ${\mathbb R}^3$), one needs to also have access
 * to the <i>gradient</i> of the push-forward function $F$. The gradient
 * is the matrix $(\nabla F)_{ij}=\partial_j F_i$, where we take the derivative
 * with regard to the chartdim reference coordinates on the flat Euclidean
 * space in which $\mathcal B$ is located. In other words, at a point
 * $\mathbf x$, $\nabla F(\mathbf x)$ is a matrix of size @p spacedim
 * times @p chartdim.
 *
 * Only the ChartManifold::get_tangent_vector() function uses the gradient
 * of the push-forward, but only a subset of all finite element codes
 * actually require the computation of tangent vectors. Consequently,
 * while derived classes need to implement the abstract virtual push_forward()
 * and pull_back() functions of this class, they do not need to implement
 * the virtual push_forward_gradient() function. Rather, that function has a
 * default implementation (and consequently is not abstract, therefore not
 * forcing derived classes to overload it), but the default implementation
 * clearly can not compute anything useful and therefore simply triggers
 * and exception.
 *
 *
 * <h3>A note on the template arguments</h3>
 *
 * The dimension arguments @p chartdim, @p dim and @p spacedim must satisfy
 * the following relationships:
 *   @code
 *      dim <= spacedim
 *      chartdim <= spacedim
 *   @endcode
 * However, there is no a priori relationship between @p dim and @p chartdim.
 * For example, if you want to describe a mapping for an edge (a 1d object) in
 * a 2d triangulation embedded in 3d space, you could do so by parameterizing
 * it via a line
 *   @f[
 *      F: [0,1] \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3
 *   @f]
 * in which case @p chartdim is 1. On the other hand, there is no reason why
 * one can't describe this as a mapping
 *   @f[
 *      F: {\mathbb R}^3 \rightarrow {\mathbb R}^3
 *   @f]
 * in such a way that the line $[0,1]\times \{0\}\times \{0\}$ happens to be
 * mapped onto the edge in question. Here, @p chartdim is 3. This may seem
 * cumbersome but satisfies the requirements of an invertible function $F$
 * just fine as long as it is possible to get from the edge to the pull-back
 * space and then back again. Finally, given that we are dealing with a 2d
 * triangulation in 3d, one will often have a mapping from, say, the 2d unit
 * square or unit disk to the domain in 3d space, and the edge in question may
 * simply be the mapped edge of the unit domain in 2d space. In this case, @p
 * chartdim is 2.
