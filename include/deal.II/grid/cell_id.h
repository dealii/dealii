/**
 * A class to represent a unique ID for a cell in a Triangulation. It is
 * returned by `cell->id()` (i.e., CellAccessor::id()) where
 * `cell` is assumed to be a cell iterator.
 *
 * This class stores the index of the coarse cell from which a cell is
 * descendant (or, more specifically, the
 * entry on
 * @ref GlossCoarseCellId "coarse cell IDs"),
 * together with information on how to reach the cell from that coarse cell
 * (i.e., which child index to take on each level of the triangulation when
 * moving from one cell to its children). The important point about this
 * class is that an object of
 * the current class uniquely identifies a cell in triangulation, and it even
 * does so in the context of objects of type
 * parallel::distributed::Triangulation where the local portion of a mesh may
 * not store all cells. For example, the CellId computed for a ghost cell on
 * one processor will be exactly the same as the CellId computed for the very
 * same cell on the processor that actually owns the cell, although the level
 * and index of the iterators pointing to that cell <i>within the
 * triangulation stored on each of the processors</i> may (and in general
 * will) be different. In other words, CellId provides the tool with which it
 * is possible to globally and uniquely identify cells in a parallel
 * triangulation, and consequently makes it possible to exchange, between
 * processors, data tied to individual cells.
 *
 * @note How this data is internally represented is not of importance (and not
 * exposed on purpose).
