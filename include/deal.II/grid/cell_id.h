/**
 * A class to represent a unique ID for a cell in a Triangulation.  This class
 * stores the index of the coarse cell from which a cell is descendant,
 * together with information on how to reach the cell from that coarse cell
 * (i.e., which child index to take on each level when moving from one cell to
 * its children). The important point about this class is that an object of
 * the current class uniquely identifies a cell in triangulation, and it even
 * does so in the context of objects of type
 * parallel::distributed::Triangulation where the local portion of a mesh may
 * not store all cells. For example, the CellId computed for a ghost cell on
 * one processor will be exactly the same as the CellId computed for the very
 * same cell on the processor that actually owns the cell, although the level
 * and index of the iterators pointing to that cell <i>within the
 * triangulation stored on each of the processors</i> may (and in general
 * will) be different. In other words, CellId provides the tool with which it
 * is possible to uniquely identify cells in a parallel triangulation, and
 * consequently makes it possible to exchange data between processors tied to
 * individual cells.
 *
 * @note How this data is internally represented is not of importance (and not
 * exposed on purpose).
 *
 * @todo Does it make sense to implement a more efficient representation
 * (internally and/or as a string)? If yes, something like a 64bit int as in
 * p4est would be a good option.
