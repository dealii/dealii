   *
   * The difference to the previous function is the second argument, a
   * sparsity pattern that represents the connectivity pattern between cells.
   *
   * While the function above builds it directly from the triangulation by
   * considering which cells neighbor each other, this function can take a
   * more refined connectivity graph. The sparsity pattern needs to be of size
   * $N\times N$, where $N$ is the number of active cells in the
   * triangulation. If the sparsity pattern contains an entry at position
   * $(i,j)$, then this means that cells $i$ and $j$ (in the order in which
   * they are traversed by active cell iterators) are to be considered
   * connected; METIS will then try to partition the domain in such a way that
   * (i) the subdomains are of roughly equal size, and (ii) a minimal number
   * of connections are broken.
   *
   * This function is mainly useful in cases where connections between cells
   * exist that are not present in the triangulation alone (otherwise the
   * previous function would be the simpler one to use). Such connections may
   * include that certain parts of the boundary of a domain are coupled
   * through symmetric boundary conditions or integrals (e.g. friction contact
   * between the two sides of a crack in the domain), or if a numerical scheme
   * is used that not only connects immediate neighbors but a larger
   * neighborhood of cells (e.g. when solving integral equations).
   *
   * In addition, this function may be useful in cases where the default
   * sparsity pattern is not entirely sufficient. This can happen because the
   * default is to just consider face neighbors, not neighboring cells that
   * are connected by edges or vertices. While the latter couple when using
   * continuous finite elements, they are typically still closely connected in
   * the neighborship graph, and METIS will not usually cut important
   * connections in this case. However, if there are vertices in the mesh
   * where many cells (many more than the common 4 or 6 in 2d and 3d,
   * respectively) come together, then there will be a significant number of
   * cells that are connected across a vertex, but several degrees removed in
   * the connectivity graph built only using face neighbors. In a case like
   * this, METIS may sometimes make bad decisions and you may want to build
   * your own connectivity graph.

   * (and potentially a minimum number of additional cells required to form a
   * valid Triangulation). The function also returns a map that allows to
   * identify the cells in the output Triangulation and corresponding cells in
   * the input list.
   *
   * The function copies the location of vertices of cells from the cells of the
   * source triangulation to the triangulation that is built from the list of
   * patch cells.  This adds support for triangulations which have been
   * perturbed or smoothed in some manner which makes the triangulation
   * deviate from the standard deal.ii refinement strategy of placing new
   * vertices at midpoints of faces or edges.
   *
   * The operation implemented by this function is frequently used in the
   * definition of error estimators that need to solve "local" problems on
   * each cell and its neighbors. A similar construction is necessary in the
   * definition of the Clement interpolation operator in which one needs to
   * solve a local problem on all cells within the support of a shape
   * function. This function then builds a complete Triangulation from a list
   * of cells that make up such a patch; one can then later attach a
   * DoFHandler to such a Triangulation.
   *
   * If the list of input cells contains only cells at the same refinement
   * level, then the output Triangulation simply consists of a Triangulation
   * containing only exactly these patch cells. On the other hand, if the
   * input cells live on different refinement levels, i.e., the Triangulation
   * of which they are part is adaptively refined, then the construction of
   * the output Triangulation is not so simple because the coarsest level of a
   * Triangulation can not contain hanging nodes. Rather, we first have to
   * find the common refinement level of all input cells, along with their
   * common parents (see GridTools::get_cells_at_coarsest_common_level()),
   * build a Triangulation from those, and then adaptively refine it so that
   * the input cells all also exist in the output Triangulation.
   *
   * A consequence of this procedure is that that output Triangulation may
   * contain more active cells than the ones that exist in the input vector.
   * On the other hand, one typically wants to solve the local problem not on
   * the entire output Triangulation, but only on those cells of it that
   * correspond to cells in the input list.  In this case, a user typically
   * wants to assign degrees of freedom only on cells that are part of the
   * "patch", and somehow ignore those excessive cells. The current function
   * supports this common requirement by setting the user flag for the cells
   * in the output Triangulation that match with cells in the input list.
   * Cells which are not part of the original patch will not have their @p
   * user_flag set; we can then avoid assigning degrees of freedom using the
   * FE_Nothing<dim> element.
   *
   * @tparam Container In C++, the compiler can not determine the type of
   * <code>Container</code> from the function call. You need to specify it as
   * an explicit template argument following the function name. This type that
   * satisfies the requirements of a mesh container (see
   * @ref ConceptMeshType).
   *
