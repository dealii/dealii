  /**
   * This function does the same as the previous one, i.e. it partitions a
   * triangulation using METIS into a number of subdomains identified by the
   * <code>cell-@>subdomain_id()</code> flag.
   *
   * The difference to the previous function is the second argument, a
   * sparsity pattern that represents the connectivity pattern between cells.
   *
   * While the function above builds it directly from the triangulation by
   * considering which cells neighbor each other, this function can take a
   * more refined connectivity graph. The sparsity pattern needs to be of size
   * $N\times N$, where $N$ is the number of active cells in the
   * triangulation. If the sparsity pattern contains an entry at position
   * $(i,j)$, then this means that cells $i$ and $j$ (in the order in which
   * they are traversed by active cell iterators) are to be considered
   * connected; METIS will then try to partition the domain in such a way that
   * (i) the subdomains are of roughly equal size, and (ii) a minimal number
   * of connections are broken.
   *
   * This function is mainly useful in cases where connections between cells
   * exist that are not present in the triangulation alone (otherwise the
   * previous function would be the simpler one to use). Such connections may
   * include that certain parts of the boundary of a domain are coupled
   * through symmetric boundary conditions or integrals (e.g. friction contact
   * between the two sides of a crack in the domain), or if a numerical scheme
   * is used that not only connects immediate neighbors but a larger
   * neighborhood of cells (e.g. when solving integral equations).
   *
   * In addition, this function may be useful in cases where the default
   * sparsity pattern is not entirely sufficient. This can happen because the
   * default is to just consider face neighbors, not neighboring cells that
   * are connected by edges or vertices. While the latter couple when using
   * continuous finite elements, they are typically still closely connected in
   * the neighborship graph, and METIS will not usually cut important
   * connections in this case. However, if there are vertices in the mesh
   * where many cells (many more than the common 4 or 6 in 2d and 3d,
   * respectively) come together, then there will be a significant number of
   * cells that are connected across a vertex, but several degrees removed in
   * the connectivity graph built only using face neighbors. In a case like
   * this, METIS may sometimes make bad decisions and you may want to build
   * your own connectivity graph.

   *
   * When reading a Triangulation from a supported input format, typical
   * informations that can be stored in a file are boundary conditions for
   * boundary faces (which we store in the boundary_id of the faces), material
   * types for cells (which we store in the material_id of the cells) and in

   *
   * If you read one of these grids into a Triangulation, you might still want
   * to use the material_id specified in the input file as a manifold_id
   * description. In this case you can associate a Manifold object to internal
   * cells, and this object will be used by the Triangulation to query
   * Manifold objects for new points. This function iterates over active cells
   * and copies the material_ids to the manifold_ids.
   *
   * The optional parameter @p compute_face_ids, indicates wether this
   * function should also set the manifold_ids of the faces (both for internal
   * faces and for faces on the boundary). If set to true, then each face will
   * get a manifold_id equal to the minimum of the surrounding manifold_ids,
   * ensuring that a unique manifold id is selected for each face of the
   * Triangulation. By default, face manifold_ids are not computed.
