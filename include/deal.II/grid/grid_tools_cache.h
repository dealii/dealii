   * some of the data structures constructed using functions in the GridTools
   * namespace which are computed only once, and then cached inside this class
   * for faster access whenever the triangulation has not changed.
   *
   * Notice that this class only notices if the underlying Triangulation has
   * changed due to a Triangulation::Signals::any_change() signal being
   * triggered.
   *
   * If the triangulation changes for other reasons, for example because you
   * use it in conjunction with a MappingQEulerian object that sees the
   * vertices through its own transformation, or because you manually change
   * some vertex locations, then some of the structures in this class become
   * obsolete, and you will have to mark them as outdated, by calling the
