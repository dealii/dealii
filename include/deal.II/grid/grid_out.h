 * @endcode
 * The function <tt>get_output_format_names()</tt> provides a list of possible
 * names of output formats in a string that is understandable by the
 * ParameterHandler class.
 *
 * Note that here, we have created an unnamed object of type GridOut and
 * called one of its <tt>write_*</tt> functions. This looks like as if the
 * respective function could really be made @p static. This was not done in
 * order to allow for parameters to be passed to the different output
 * functions in a way compatible with the scheme of allowing the right output
 * format to be selected at run-time through the generic @p write function.
 *
 * In order to explain this, consider each function had one or more additional
 * parameters giving the details of output, for example position of the
 * spectator for 3d meshed, line thicknesses, etc. While this would allow each
 * output function any flexibility it needs, it would not allow us to use the
 * generic function @p write which is given a parameter determining the output
 * format, since it is impractical to give it a list of parameters for each
 * and every output format supported which it may then pass on to the
 * respective output function.
 *
 * Rather, we have chosen to let each object of this class GridOut have a set
 * of parameters for each supported output format. These are collected in
 * structures GridOutFlags::Eps(), GridOutFlags::Gnuplot(), etc declared in
 * the GridOutFlags namespace, and you can set your preferred flags like this:
 * @code
 *   GridOut grid_out;
 *   GridOutFlags::Ucd ucd_flags;
 *   ...    // set some fields in ucd_flags
 *   grid_out.set_flags (ucd_flags);
 *   ...
 *   ...    // write some file with data_out
 * @endcode
 * The respective output function then use the so-set flags. By default, they
 * are set to reasonable values as described above and in the documentation of
 * the different flags structures. Resetting the flags can be done by calling
 * <tt>grid_out.set_flags (GridOutFlags::Ucd());</tt>, since the default
 * constructor of each of the flags structures sets the parameters to their
 * initial values.
 *
 * The advantage of this approach is that it is possible to change the flags
 * of one or more output formats according to your needs and later use the
 * generic @p write function; the actual output function then called will use
 * the flags as set before.
 *
 * Note that some of the structures describing the flags of the different
 * output formats are empty since the respective format does not support any
 * flags. The structure and the @p set_flags function are provided anyway.
 * Note also that some of the structures may differ between the dimensions
 * supported by this class; they then have a template parameter, as usual.

   * In GNUPLOT format, each cell is written as a sequence of its confining
   * lines. Apart from the coordinates of the line's end points, the level and
   * the material of the cell are appended to each line of output. Therefore,
   * if you let GNUPLOT draw a 2d grid as a 3d plot, you will see more refined
   * cells being raised against cells with less refinement.  Also, if you draw
   * a cut through a 3d grid, you can extrude the refinement level in the
   * direction orthogonal to the cut plane. The same can be done with the
   * material id, which is plotted after the level.
   *
   * A more useful application of this feature is the following: if you use
   * the GNUPLOT command (for a 2d grid here)
   * @verbatim
   * splot [:][:][2.5:3.5] "grid_file.gnuplot" *
   * @endverbatim
   * then the whole x- and y-range will be plotted, i.e. the whole grid, but
   * only those lines with a z-value between 2.5 and 3.5. Since the z-values
   * were chosen to be the level to which a cell belongs, this results in a
   * plot of those cells only that belong to level 3 in this example. This
   * way, it is easy to produce plots of the different levels of grid.
