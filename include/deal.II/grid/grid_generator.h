/**
 * This namespace provides a collection of functions for generating

 *
 * Some of these functions receive a flag @p colorize (see
 * @ref GlossColorization "the glossary entry on colorization").
 * If this is set, parts of the boundary receive different
 * @ref GlossBoundaryIndicator "boundary indicators"
 * allowing them to be distinguished for the purpose of evaluating
 * different boundary conditions.
 *
 * If the domain is curved, each of the domain parts that should be
 * refined by following an appropriate Manifold description will
 * receive a different
 * @ref GlossManifoldIndicator "manifold indicator",
 * and the correct Manifold descriptor will be attached to
 * the Triangulation. Notice that if you later transform the
 * triangulation, you have to make sure you attach the correct new Manifold
 * to the triangulation.

   * used in step-6.
   *
   * In order to avoid degenerate cells at the boundaries, the circle is
   * triangulated by five cells, whereas in 3d the ball is subdivided by
   * seven cells. Specifically, these
   * cells are one cell in the center plus one "cap" cell on each of the faces
   * of this center cell. This ensures that under repeated refinement, none
   * of the cells at the outer boundary will degenerate to have an interior
   * angle approaching 180 degrees, as opposed to the case where one might
   * start with just one square (or cube) to approximate the domain.
   * The diameter of the
   * center cell is chosen so that the aspect ratio of the boundary cells
   * after one refinement is optimized.
   *
   * This function is declared to exist for triangulations of all space
   * dimensions, but throws an error if called in 1d.
   *
   * By default, the manifold_id is set to 0 on the boundary faces, 1 on the
   * boundary cells, and numbers::flat_manifold_id on the central cell and on
   * internal faces.
   *
   * A SphericalManifold is attached by default to the boundary faces for
   * correct placement of boundary vertices upon refinement and to be able to
   * use higher order mappings. However, it turns out that this strategy may
   * not be the optimal one to create a good a mesh for a hyperball. The
   * "Possibilities for extensions" section of step-6 has an extensive
   * discussion of how one would construct better meshes and what one needs to
   * do for it. Setting the argument
   * `attach_spherical_manifold_on_boundary_cells` to true attaches a
   * SphericalManifold manifold also to the cells adjacent to the boundary, and
   * not only to the boundary faces.
   *
   * @note Since this is likely one of the earliest functions users typically
   *   consider to create meshes with curved boundaries, let us also comment
   *   on one aspect that is often confusing: Namely, that what one sees is not
   *   always what is actually happening. Specifically, if you output the coarse
   *   mesh with a function such as GridOut::write_vtk() using default options,
   *   then one doesn't generally get to see curved faces at the boundary.
   *   That's because most file formats by default only store vertex locations,
   *   with the implicit understanding that cells are composed from these
   *   vertices and bounded by straight edges. At the same time, the fact
   *   that this function attaches a SphericalManifold object to the boundary
   *   faces means that at least *internally*, edges really are curved. If
   *   you want to see them that way, you need to make sure that the function
   *   you use to output the mesh actually plots boundary faces as curved
   *   lines rather than straight lines characterized by only the locations
   *   of the two end points. For example, GridOut::write_gnuplot() can do
   *   that if you set the corresponding flag in the GridOutFlags::Gnuplot
   *   structure. It is, however, an entirely separate consideration whether
   *   you are actually *computing* on curved cells. In typical finite
   *   element computations, one has to compute integrals and these are
   *   computed by transforming back actual cells using a mapping to the
   *   reference cell. What mapping is used determines what shape the
   *   cells have for these internal computations: For example, with the
   *   widely used $Q_1$ mapping (implicitly used in step-6), integration
   *   always happens on cells that are assumed to have straight boundaries
   *   described by only the vertex locations. In other words, if such a
   *   mapping is used, then the cells of the domain really do have
   *   straight edges, regardless of the manifold description attached
   *   to these edges and regardless of the flags given when generating
   *   output. As a consequence of all of this, it is important to
   *   distinguish three things: (i) the manifold description attached to an
   *   object in the mesh; (ii) the mapping used in integration; and (iii) the
   *   style used in outputting graphical information about the mesh. All of
   *   these can be chosen more or less independently of each other, and
   *   what you see visualized is not necessarily exactly what is
   *   happening.

   * Produce a grid consisting of concentric shells. The primary difference
   * between this function and GridGenerator::hyper_shell() is that this
   * function permits unevenly spaced (in the radial direction)
   * @ref GlossCoarseMesh "coarse level cells".
   *
   * The parameters @p center, @p inner_radius, and @p outer_radius behave in
   * the same way as the first three arguments to
   * GridGenerator::hyper_shell. @p n_shells gives the total number of shells
   * to use (i.e., the number of cells in the radial direction). The outer
   * radius of the $k$th shell is given by
   *
   * @f[
   *     r = r_{\mathrm{inner}} + (r_\mathrm{outer} - r_\mathrm{inner})
   *     \frac{1 - \tanh(\mathrm{skewness}(1 - k/\mathrm{n\_shells}))}
   *          {\tanh(\mathrm{skewness})}
   * @f]
   *
   * where @p skewness is a parameter controlling the shell spacing in the
   * radial direction: values of @p skewness close to zero correspond to even
   * spacing, while larger values of @p skewness (such as $2$ or $3$)
   * correspond to shells biased to the inner radius.
   *
   * @p n_cells_per_shell is the same as in GridGenerator::hyper_shell: in 2d
   * the default choice of zero will result in 8 cells per shell (and 12 in
   * 3d). The only valid values in 3d are 6 (the default), 12, and 96 cells:
   * see the documentation of GridGenerator::hyper_shell for more information.
   *
   * If @p colorize is <code>true</code> then the outer boundary of the merged
   * shells has a boundary id of $1$ and the inner boundary has a boundary id
   * of $0$.

   *
   * In particular, since TransfiniteInterpolationManifold interpolates

  /**
   * This function implements a boundary subgrid extraction.  Given a
   * <dim,spacedim>-Triangulation (the "volume mesh") the function extracts a
   * subset of its boundary (the "surface mesh").  The boundary to be
   * extracted is specified by a list of boundary_ids.  If none is specified
   * the whole boundary will be extracted. The function is used in step-38.
   *
   * The function also builds a mapping linking the cells on the surface mesh
   * to the corresponding faces on the volume one. This mapping is the return
   * value of the function.
   *
   * @note The function builds the surface mesh by creating a
   * @ref GlossCoarseMesh "coarse mesh"
   * from
   * the selected faces of the coarse cells of the volume mesh. It copies the
   * boundary indicators of these faces to the cells of the coarse surface
   * mesh. The surface mesh is then refined in the same way as the faces of
   * the volume mesh are. In order to ensure that the surface mesh has the
   * same vertices as the volume mesh, it is therefore important that you
   * assign appropriate boundary descriptions through
   * Triangulation::set_manifold() to the surface mesh object before calling
   * this function. If you don't, the refinement will happen under the
   * assumption that all faces are straight (i.e using the FlatManifold class)
   * rather than utilizing the Manifold object you may want to use to determine
   * the location of new vertices.
   *
   * @tparam MeshType A type that satisfies the requirements of the
   * @ref ConceptMeshType "MeshType concept".
   * The map that is returned will be between cell iterators pointing into the
   * container describing the surface mesh and face iterators of the volume
   * mesh container. If MeshType is DoFHandler, then the function will re-build
   * the triangulation underlying the second argument and return a map between
   * appropriate iterators into the MeshType arguments. However, the function
   * will not actually distribute degrees of freedom on this newly created
   * surface mesh.
   *
   * @tparam dim The dimension of the cells of the volume mesh. For example,
   * if dim==2, then the cells are quadrilaterals that either live in the
   * plane, or form a surface in a higher-dimensional space. The dimension of
   * the cells of the surface mesh is consequently dim-1.
   * @tparam spacedim The dimension of the space in which both the volume and
   * the surface mesh live.
   *
   * @param[in] volume_mesh A container of cells that define the volume mesh.
   * @param[out] surface_mesh A container whose associated triangulation will
   * be built to consist of the cells that correspond to the (selected portion
   * of) the boundary of the volume mesh.
   * @param[in] boundary_ids A list of boundary indicators denoting that
   * subset of faces of volume cells for which this function should extract
   * the surface mesh. If left at its default, i.e., if the set is empty, then
   * the function operates on <i>all</i> boundary faces.
   *
   * @return A map that for each cell of the surface mesh (key) returns an
   * iterator to the corresponding face of a cell of the volume mesh (value).
   * The keys include both active and non-active cells of the surface mesh.
   * The order of vertices of surface cells and the corresponding
   * volume faces may not match in order to ensure that each surface cell is
   * associated with an outward facing normal.
   * As a consequence, if you want to match quantities on the faces of the
   * domain cells and on the cells of the surface mesh, you may have to
   * translate between vertex locations or quadrature points.
   *
   * @note The algorithm outlined above assumes that all faces on higher
   * refinement levels always have exactly the same boundary indicator as
   * their parent face. Consequently, we can start with coarse level faces and
   * build the surface mesh based on that. It would not be very difficult to
   * extend the function to also copy boundary indicators from finer level
   * faces to their corresponding surface mesh cells, for example to
   * accommodate different geometry descriptions in the case of curved
   * boundaries (but this is not currently implemented).
   *
   * @note Since @p volume_mesh and @p surface_mesh have different spatial
   * dimensions no manifold objects are copied by this function: you must
   * attach new manifold objects to @p surface_mesh.
