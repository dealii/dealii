/**
 * This class implements an input mechanism for grid data. It allows to read a
 * grid structure into a triangulation object. At present, UCD (unstructured
 * cell data), DB Mesh, XDA, Gmsh, Tecplot, NetCDF, UNV, VTK, and Cubit are
 * supported as input format for grid data. Any numerical data other than
 * geometric (vertex locations) and topological (how vertices form cells)
 * information is ignored.
 *
 * @note Since deal.II only supports line, quadrilateral and hexahedral
 * meshes, the functions in this class can only read meshes that consist
 * exclusively of such cells. If you absolutely need to work with a mesh that
 * uses triangles or tetrahedra, then your only option is to convert the mesh
 * to quadrilaterals and hexahedra. A tool that can do this is tethex, see
 * http://code.google.com/p/tethex/wiki/Tethex .
 *
 * The mesh you read will form the coarsest level of a @p Triangulation
 * object. As such, it must not contain hanging nodes or other forms or
 * adaptive refinement and strange things will happen if the mesh represented
 * by the input file does in fact have them. This is due to the fact that most
 * mesh description formats do not store neighborship information between
 * cells, so the grid reading functions have to regenerate it. They do so by
 * checking whether two cells have a common face. If there are hanging nodes
 * in a triangulation, adjacent cells have no common (complete) face, so the
 * grid reader concludes that the adjacent cells have no neighbors along these
 * faces and must therefore be at the boundary. In effect, an internal crack
 * of the domain is introduced this way. Since such cases are very hard to
 * detect (how is GridIn supposed to decide whether a place where the faces of
 * two small cells coincide with the face or a larger cell is in fact a
 * hanging node associated with local refinement, or is indeed meant to be a
 * crack in the domain?), the library does not make any attempt to catch such
 * situations, and you will get a triangulation that probably does not do what
 * you want. If your goal is to save and later read again a triangulation that
 * has been adaptively refined, then this class is not your solution; rather
 * take a look at the PersistentTriangulation class.
 *
 * @note It is not uncommon to experience unexpected problems when reading
 * generated meshes for the first time using this class. If this applies to
 * you, be sure to read the documentation right until the end, and also read
 * the documentation of the GridReordering class.
 *
 * To read grid data, the triangulation to be fed with has to be empty. When
 * giving a file which does not contain the assumed information or which does
 * not keep to the right format, the state of the triangulation will be
 * undefined afterwards. Upon input, only lines in one dimension and line and
 * quads in two dimensions are accepted. All other cell types (e.g. triangles
 * in two dimensions, quads and hexes in 3d) are rejected. The vertex and cell
 * numbering in the input file, which need not be consecutively, is lost upon
 * transfer to the triangulation object, since this one needs consecutively
 * numbered elements.
 *
 * Material indicators are accepted to denote the material ID of cells and to
 * denote boundary part indication for lines in 2D. Read the according
 * sections in the documentation of the Triangulation class for further
 * details.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Supported input formats</h3>
 *
 * At present, the following input formats are supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li> @p UCD (unstructured cell data) format: this format is used for grid
 * input as well as data output. If there are data vectors in the input file,
 * they are ignored, as we are only interested in the grid in this class. The
 * UCD format requires the vertices to be in following ordering: in 2d
 * @verbatim
 *      3-----2
 *      |     |
 *      |     |
 *      |     |
 *      0-----1
 * @endverbatim
 * and in 3d
 * @verbatim
 *         7-------6        7-------6
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *       / |       |      /       / |
 *      /  |       |     /       /  |
 *     3   |       |    3-------2   |
 *     |   4-------5    |       |   5
 *     |  /       /     |       |  /
 *     | /       /      |       | /
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     0-------1        0-------1
 * @endverbatim
 * Note, that this ordering is different from the deal.II numbering scheme,
 * see the Triangulation class.  The exact description of the UCD format can
 * be found in the AVS Explorer manual (see http://www.avs.com).  The @p UCD
 * format can be read by the read_ucd() function.
 *
 * <li> <tt>DB mesh</tt> format: this format is used by the @p BAMG mesh
 * generator (see http://www-rocq.inria.fr/gamma/cdrom/www/bamg/eng.htm. The
 * documentation of the format in the @p BAMG manual is very incomplete, so we
 * don't actually parse many of the fields of the output since we don't know
 * their meaning, but the data that is read is enough to build up the mesh as
 * intended by the mesh generator. This format can be read by the
 * read_dbmesh() function.
 *
 * <li> @p XDA format: this is a rather simple format used by the MGF code. We
 * don't have an exact specification of the format, but the reader can read in
 * several example files. If the reader does not grok your files, it should be
 * fairly simple to extend it.
 *
 * <li> <tt>Gmsh 1.0 mesh</tt> format: this format is used by the @p GMSH mesh
 * generator (see http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/). The documentation in the @p GMSH
 * manual explains how to generate meshes compatible with the deal.II library
 * (i.e. quads rather than triangles). In order to use this format, Gmsh has
 * to output the file in the old format 1.0. This is done adding the line
 * "Mesh.MshFileVersion = 1" to the input file.
 *
 * <li> <tt>Gmsh 2.0 mesh</tt> format: this is a variant of the above format.
 * The read_msh() function automatically determines whether an input file is
 * version 1 or version 2.
 *
 * <li> <tt>Tecplot</tt> format: this format is used by @p TECPLOT and often
 * serves as a basis for data exchange between different applications. Note,
 * that currently only the ASCII format is supported, binary data cannot be
 * read.
 *
 * <li> <tt>UNV</tt> format: this format is generated by the Salome mesh
 * generator, see http://www.salome-platform.org/ . The sections of the format
 * that the GridIn::read_unv function supports are documented here:
 * <ul>
 * <li> section 2411: http://www.sdrl.uc.edu/universal-file-formats-for-modal-
 * analysis-testing-1/file-format-storehouse/unv_2411.htm
 * <li> section 2412: http://www.sdrl.uc.edu/universal-file-formats-for-modal-
 * analysis-testing-1/file-format-storehouse/unv_2412.htm
 * <li> section 2467: http://www.sdrl.uc.edu/universal-file-formats-for-modal-
 * analysis-testing-1/file-format-storehouse/unv_2467.htm
 * <li> all sections of this format, even if they may not be supported in our
 * reader, can be found here: http://www.sdrl.uc.edu/universal-file-formats-
 * for-modal-analysis-testing-1/file-format-storehouse/file-formats
 * </ul>
 * Note that Salome, let's say in 2D, can only make a quad mesh on an object
 * that has exactly 4 edges (or 4 pieces of the boundary). That means, that if
 * you have a more complicated object and would like to mesh it with quads,
 * you will need to decompose the object into >= 2 separate objects. Then 1)
 * each of these separate objects is meshed, 2) the appropriate groups of
 * cells and/or faces associated with each of these separate objects are
 * created, 3) a compound mesh is built up, and 4) all numbers that might be
 * associated with some of the internal faces of this compound mesh are
 * removed.
 *
 * <li> <tt>VTK</tt> format: VTK Unstructured Grid Legacy file reader
 * generator. The reader can handle only Unstructured Grid format of data at
 * present for 2D & 3D geometries. The documentation for the general legacy
 * vtk file, including Unstructured Grid format can be found here:
 * http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/~slombey/asci/vtk/vtk_formats.simple.html
 *
 * The VTK format requires the vertices to be in following ordering: in 2d
 * @verbatim
 *      3-----2
 *      |     |
 *      |     |
 *      |     |
 *      0-----1
 * @endverbatim
 * and in 3d
 * @verbatim
 *         7-------6        7-------6
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *       / |       |      /       / |
 *      /  |       |     /       /  |
 *     4   |       |    4-------5   |
 *     |   3-------2    |       |   2
 *     |  /       /     |       |  /
 *     | /       /      |       | /
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     0-------1        0-------1
 * @endverbatim
 *
 *
 * <li> <tt>Cubit</tt> format: deal.II doesn't directly support importing from
 * Cubit at this time. However, Cubit can export in UCD format using a simple
 * plug-in, and the resulting UCD file can then be read by this class. The
 * plug-in script can be found on the deal.II wiki page,
 * http://code.google.com/p/dealii/wiki/MeshInputAndOutput .
 *
 * There is also a little program <code>bin/mesh_conversion</code> (in the
 * directory where deal.II was installed), written by Jean-Paul Pelteret, that
 * can convert Cubit ABAQUS files into the UCD format that can be read in as
 * discussed above. The program was designed with the intention of exporting
 * geometries with complex boundary condition surfaces and multiple materials
 * from Cubit - information which is currently not easily obtained through
 * Cubit's python interface. Using the the program is simple: to use it, it
 * needs to be built and run with the command
 * @code
 *  /path/to/deal.II/bin/mesh_conversion <spatial_dimension> /path/to/input_file.inp /path/to/output_file.ucd
 * @endcode.
 * More information is available in the readme file included with the program
 * and located in the <code>contrib/mesh_conversion/README.txt</code> file in
 * the deal.II source directory tree. Note that the program's copyright
 * remains with its author and that it is under a separate license than the
 * rest of the library.
 *
 * To build the program, see the <code>doc/readmes.html</code> and
 * <code>doc/development/cmake.html</code> files.
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Structure of input grid data. The GridReordering class</h3>
 *
 * It is your duty to use a correct numbering of vertices in the cell list,
 * i.e. for lines in 1d, you have to first give the vertex with the lower
 * coordinate value, then that with the higher coordinate value. For
 * quadrilaterals in two dimensions, the vertex indices in the @p quad list
 * have to be such that the vertices are numbered in counter-clockwise sense.
 *
 * In two dimensions, another difficulty occurs, which has to do with the
 * sense of a quadrilateral. A quad consists of four lines which have a
 * direction, which is per definitionem as follows:
 * @verbatim
 *   3-->--2
 *   |     |
 *   ^     ^
 *   |     |
 *   0-->--1
 * @endverbatim
 * Now, two adjacent cells must have a vertex numbering such that the
 * direction of the common side is the same. For example, the following two
 * quads
 * @verbatim
 *   3---4---5
 *   |   |   |
 *   0---1---2
 * @endverbatim
 * may be characterised by the vertex numbers <tt>(0 1 4 3)</tt> and <tt>(1 2
 * 5 4)</tt>, since the middle line would get the direction <tt>1->4</tt> when
 * viewed from both cells.  The numbering <tt>(0 1 4 3)</tt> and <tt>(5 4 1
 * 2)</tt> would not be allowed, since the left quad would give the common
 * line the direction <tt>1->4</tt>, while the right one would want to use
 * <tt>4->1</tt>, leading to an ambiguity. The Triangulation object is capable
 * of detecting this special case, which can be eliminated by rotating the
 * indices of the right quad by two. However, it would not know what to do if
 * you gave the vertex indices <tt>(4 1 2 5)</tt>, since then it would have to
 * rotate by one element or three, the decision which to take is not yet
 * implemented.
 *
 * There are more ambiguous cases, where the triangulation may not know what
 * to do at all without the use of sophisticated algorithms. Furthermore,
 * similar problems exist in three space dimensions, where faces and lines
 * have orientations that need to be taken care of.
 *
 * For this reason, the <tt>read_*</tt> functions of this class that read in
 * grids in various input formats call the GridReordering class to bring the
 * order of vertices that define the cells into an ordering that satisfies the
 * requiremenets of the Triangulation class. Be sure to read the documentation
 * of that class if you experience unexpected problems when reading grids
 * through this class.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Dealing with distorted mesh cells</h3>
 *
 * For each of the mesh reading functions, the last call is always to
 * Triangulation::create_triangulation(). That function checks whether all the
 * cells it creates as part of the coarse mesh are distorted or not (where
 * distortion here means that the Jacobian of the mapping from the reference
 * cell to the real cell has a non-positive determinant, i.e. the cell is
 * pinched or twisted; see the entry on
 * @ref GlossDistorted "distorted cells"
 * in the glossary). If it finds any such cells, it throws an exception. This
 * exception is not caught in the grid reader functions of the current class,
 * and so will propagate through to the function that called it. There, you
 * can catch and ignore the exception if you are certain that there is no harm
 * in dealing with such cells. If you were not aware that your mesh had such
 * cells, your results will likely be of dubious quality at best if you ignore
 * the exception.
