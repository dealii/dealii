     * Store all information which belongs to one level of the multilevel

     *
     * In TriaLevel, all cell data is stored which is not dependent on the
     * dimension, e.g. a field to store the refinement flag for the cells
     * (what a cell actually is is declared elsewhere), etc. See also
     * TriaObjects for non level-oriented data.
     *
     * There is another field, which may fit in here, namely the material data
     * (for cells) or the boundary indicators (for faces), but since we need
     * for a line or quad either boundary information or material data, we
     * store them with the lines and quads rather than with the common data.
     * Likewise, in 3d, we need boundary indicators for lines and quads (we
     * need to know how to refine a line if the two adjacent faces have
     * different boundary indicators), and material data for cells.
