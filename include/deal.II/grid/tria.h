/**
 * Triangulations denote a hierarchy of levels of elements which together form
 * a @p dim -dimensional manifold in @p spacedim spatial dimensions (if
 * spacedim is not specified it takes the default value @p spacedim=dim).
 *
 * Thus, for example, an object of type @p Triangulation<1,1> (or simply @p
 * Triangulation<1> since @p spacedim==dim by default) is used to represent
 * and handle the usual one-dimensional triangulation used in the finite
 * element method (so, segments on a straight line). On the other hand,
 * objects such as @p Triangulation<1,2> or @p Triangulation<2,3> (that are
 * associated with curves in 2D or surfaces in 3D) are the ones one wants to
 * use in the boundary element method.
 *
 * This class is written to be as independent of the dimension as possible
 * (thus the complex construction of the
 * dealii::internal::Triangulation::TriaLevel classes) to allow code-sharing,
 * to allow reducing the need to mirror changes in the code for one dimension
 * to the code for other dimensions. Nonetheless, some of the functions are
 * dependent of the dimension and there only exist specialized versions for
 * distinct dimensions.
 *
 * This class satisfies the requirements outlined in
 * @ref GlossMeshAsAContainer "Meshes as containers".
 *
 *
 * <h3>Structure and iterators</h3>
 *
 * The actual data structure of a Triangulation object is rather complex and
 * quite inconvenient if one attempted to operate on it directly, since data
 * is spread over quite a lot of arrays and other places. However, there are
 * ways powerful enough to work on these data structures without knowing their
 * exact relations. This is done through the concept of iterators (see the STL
 * documentation and TriaIterator). In order to make things as easy and
 * dimension independent as possible, use of class local typedefs is made, see
 * below.
 *
 * The Triangulation class provides iterator which enable looping over all
 * cells without knowing the exact representation used to describe them. Their
 * names are typedefs imported from the Iterators class (thus making them
 * local types to this class) and are as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> <tt>cell_iterator</tt>: loop over all cells used in the Triangulation
 * <li> <tt>active_cell_iterator</tt>: loop over all active cells
 * </ul>
 *
 * For <tt>dim==1</tt>, these iterators are mapped as follows:
 *  @code
 *    typedef line_iterator        cell_iterator;
 *    typedef active_line_iterator active_cell_iterator;
 *  @endcode
 * while for @p dim==2 we have the additional face iterator:
 *  @code
 *    typedef quad_iterator        cell_iterator;
 *    typedef active_quad_iterator active_cell_iterator;
 *
 *    typedef line_iterator        face_iterator;
 *    typedef active_line_iterator active_face_iterator;
 *  @endcode
 *
 * By using the cell iterators, you can write code independent of the spatial
 * dimension. The same applies for substructure iterators, where a
 * substructure is defined as a face of a cell. The face of a cell is a vertex
 * in 1D and a line in 2D; however, vertices are handled in a different way
 * and therefore lines have no faces.
 *
 * The Triangulation class offers functions like begin_active() which gives
 * you an iterator to the first active cell. There are quite a lot of
 * functions returning iterators. Take a look at the class doc to get an
 * overview.
 *
 * Usage of these iterators works mostly like with the STL iterators. Some
 * examples taken from the Triangulation source code follow (notice that in
 * the last two examples the template parameter @p spacedim has been omitted,
 * so it takes the default value <code>dim</code>).
 * <ul>
 * <li> <em>Counting the number of cells on a specific level</em>
 *    @code
 *     template <int dim, int spacedim>
 *     int Triangulation<dim, spacedim>::n_cells (const int level) const {
 *        cell_iterator cell = begin (level),
 *                      endc = end(level);
 *        int n=0;
 *        for (; cell!=endc; ++cell)
 *          ++n;
 *        return n;
 *      };
 *    @endcode
 * Another way which uses the STL @p distance function would be to write
 *    @code
 *      template <int dim>
 *      int Triangulation<dim>::n_cells (const int level) const {
 *        int n=0;
 *        distance (begin(level),
 *                  (level == levels.size()-1 ?
 *                   cell_iterator(end()) :
 *                   begin (level+1)),
 *                  n);
 *        return n;
 *      };
 *    @endcode
 *
 * <li> <em>Refining all cells of a triangulation</em>
 *    @code
 *      template <int dim>
 *      void Triangulation<dim>::refine_global () {
 *        active_cell_iterator cell = begin_active(),
 *                             endc = end();
 *
 *        for (; cell != endc; ++cell)
 *          cell->set_refine_flag ();
 *        execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *      };
 *    @endcode
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Usage of a Triangulation is mainly done through the use of iterators. An
 * example probably shows best how to use it:
 *  @code
 *  void main () {
 *    Triangulation<2> tria;
 *
 *    // read in a coarse grid file
 *
 *                                     // we want to log the
 *                                     // refinement history
 *    ofstream history ("mesh.history");
 *
 *                                     // refine first cell
 *    tria.begin_active()->set_refine_flag();
 *    tria.save_refine_flags (history);
 *    tria.execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *
 *                                     // refine first active cell
 *                                     // on coarsest level
 *    tria.begin_active()->set_refine_flag ();
 *    tria.save_refine_flags (history);
 *    tria.execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *
 *    Triangulation<2>::active_cell_iterator cell;
 *    for (int i=0; i<17; ++i)
 *      {
 *                                         // refine the presently
 *                                         // second last cell 17
 *                                         // times
 *        cell = tria.last_active(tria.n_levels()-1);
 *        --cell;
 *        cell->set_refine_flag ();
 *        tria.save_refine_flags (history);
 *        tria.execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *      };
 *                                       // output the grid
 *    ofstream out("grid.1");
 *    GridOut::write_gnuplot (tria, out);
 *  };
 *  @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h3>Creating a triangulation</h3>
 *
 * There are several possibilities to create a triangulation:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The most common domains, such as hypercubes (i.e. lines, squares,
 * cubes, etc), hyper-balls (circles, balls, ...) and some other, more weird
 * domains such as the L-shape region and higher dimensional generalizations
 * and others, are provided by the GridGenerator class which takes a
 * triangulation and fills it by a division of the required domain.
 *
 * <li> Reading in a triangulation: By using an object of the GridIn class,
 * you can read in fairly general triangulations. See there for more
 * information. The mentioned class uses the interface described directly
 * below to transfer the data into the triangulation.
 *
 * <li> Explicitly creating a triangulation: you can create a triangulation by
 * providing a list of vertices and a list of cells. Each such cell consists
 * of a vector storing the indices of the vertices of this cell in the vertex
 * list. To see how this works, you can take a look at the GridIn<dim>::read_*
 * functions. The appropriate function to be called is create_triangulation().
 *
 * Creating the hierarchical information needed for this library from cells
 * storing only vertex information can be quite a complex task.  For example
 * in 2D, we have to create lines between vertices (but only once, though
 * there are two cells which link these two vertices) and we have to create
 * neighborhood information. Grids being read in should therefore not be too
 * large, reading refined grids would be inefficient (although there is
 * technically no problem in reading grids with several 10.000 or 100.000
 * cells; the library can handle this without much problems). Apart from the
 * performance aspect, refined grids do not lend too well to multigrid
 * algorithms, since solving on the coarsest level is expensive. It is wiser
 * in any case to read in a grid as coarse as possible and then do the needed
 * refinement steps.
 *
 * It is your duty to guarantee that cells have the correct orientation. To
 * guarantee this, in the input vector keeping the cell list, the vertex
 * indices for each cell have to be in a defined order, see the documentation
 * of GeometryInfo<dim>. In one dimension, the first vertex index must refer
 * to that vertex with the lower coordinate value. In 2D and 3D, the
 * corresponding conditions are not easy to verify and no full attempt to do
 * so is made. If you violate this condition, you may end up with matrix
 * entries having the wrong sign (clockwise vertex numbering, which results in
 * a negative area element) of with wrong matrix elements (twisted
 * quadrilaterals, i.e. two vertices interchanged; this results in a wrong
 * area element).
 *
 * There are more subtle conditions which must be imposed upon the vertex
 * numbering within cells. They do not only hold for the data read from an UCD
 * or any other input file, but also for the data passed to
 * create_triangulation(). See the documentation for the GridIn class for more
 * details on this, and above all to the GridReordering class that explains
 * many of the problems and an algorithm to reorder cells such that they
 * satisfy the conditions outlined above.
 *
 * <li> Copying a triangulation: when computing on time dependent meshes or
 * when using adaptive refinement, you will often want to create a new
 * triangulation to be the same as another one. This is facilitated by the @p
 * copy_triangulation function.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that vertex, line or cell numbers in the two
 * triangulations are the same and that two iterators walking on the two
 * triangulations visit matching cells if they are incremented in parallel. It
 * may be conceivable to implement a clean-up in the copy operation, which
 * eliminates holes of unused memory, re-joins scattered data and so on. In
 * principle this would be a useful operation but guaranteeing some
 * parallelism in the two triangulations seems more important since usually
 * data will have to be transferred between the grids.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Finally, there is a special function for folks who like bad grids:
 * distort_random(). It moves all the vertices in the grid a bit around by a
 * random value, leaving behind a distorted mesh. Note that you should apply
 * this function to the final mesh, since refinement smoothes the mesh a bit.
 *
 * The function will make sure that vertices on restricted faces (hanging
 * nodes) will end up in the correct place, i.e. in the middle of the two
 * other vertices of the mother line, and the analogue in higher space
 * dimensions (vertices on the boundary are not corrected, so don't distort
 * boundary vertices in more than two space dimension, i.e. in dimensions
 * where boundary vertices can be hanging nodes). Applying the algorithm has
 * another drawback related to the placement of cells, however: the children
 * of a cell will not occupy the same region of the domain as the mother cell
 * does. While this is the usual behavior with cells at the boundary, here you
 * may get into trouble when using multigrid algorithms or when transferring
 * solutions from coarse to fine grids and back. In general, the use of this
 * function is only safe if you only use the most refined level of the
 * triangulation for computations.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3>Refinement and coarsening of a triangulation</h3>
 *
 * Refinement of a triangulation may be done through several ways. The most
 * low-level way is directly through iterators: let @p i be an iterator to an
 * active cell (i.e. the cell pointed to has no children), then the function
 * call <tt>i->set_refine_flag()</tt> marks the respective cell for
 * refinement. Marking non-active cells results in an error.
 *
 * After all the cells you wanted to mark for refinement, call
 * execute_coarsening_and_refinement() to actually perform the refinement.
 * This function itself first calls the @p prepare_coarsening_and_refinement
 * function to regularize the resulting triangulation: since a face between
 * two adjacent cells may only be subdivided once (i.e. the levels of two
 * adjacent cells may differ by one at most; it is not possible to have a cell
 * refined twice while the neighboring one is not refined), some additional
 * cells are flagged for refinement to smooth the grid. This enlarges the
 * number of resulting cells but makes the grid more regular, thus leading to
 * better approximation properties and, above all, making the handling of data
 * structures and algorithms much much easier. To be honest, this is mostly an
 * algorithmic step than one needed by the finite element method.
 *
 * To coarsen a grid, the same way as above is possible by using
 * <tt>i->set_coarsen_flag</tt> and calling
 * execute_coarsening_and_refinement().
 *
 * The reason for first coarsening, then refining is that the refinement
 * usually adds some additional cells to keep the triangulation regular and
 * thus satisfies all refinement requests, while the coarsening does not
 * delete cells not requested for; therefore the refinement will often revert
 * some effects of coarsening while the opposite is not true. The stated order
 * of coarsening before refinement will thus normally lead to a result closer
 * to the intended one.
 *
 * Marking cells for refinement 'by hand' through iterators is one way to
 * produce a new grid, especially if you know what kind of grid you are
 * looking for, e.g. if you want to have a grid successively refined towards
 * the boundary or always at the center (see the example programs, they do
 * exactly these things). There are more advanced functions, however, which
 * are more suitable for automatic generation of hierarchical grids in the
 * context of a posteriori error estimation and adaptive finite elements.
 * These functions can be found in the GridRefinement class.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Smoothing of a triangulation</h3>
 *
 * Some degradation of approximation properties has been observed for grids
 * which are too unstructured. Therefore, prepare_coarsening_and_refinement()
 * which is automatically called by execute_coarsening_and_refinement() can do
 * some smoothing of the triangulation. Note that mesh smoothing is only done
 * for two or more space dimensions, no smoothing is available at present for
 * one spatial dimension. In the following, let <tt>execute_*</tt> stand for
 * execute_coarsening_and_refinement().
 *
 * For the purpose of smoothing, the Triangulation constructor takes an
 * argument specifying whether a smoothing step shall be performed on the grid
 * each time <tt>execute_*</tt> is called. The default is that such a step not
 * be done, since this results in additional cells being produced, which may
 * not be necessary in all cases. If switched on, calling <tt>execute_*</tt>
 * results in flagging additional cells for refinement to avoid vertices as
 * the ones mentioned. The algorithms for both regularization and smoothing of
 * triangulations are described below in the section on technical issues. The
 * reason why this parameter must be given to the constructor rather than to
 * <tt>execute_*</tt> is that it would result in algorithmic problems if you
 * called <tt>execute_*</tt> once without and once with smoothing, since then
 * in some refinement steps would need to be refined twice.
 *
 * The parameter taken by the constructor is an integer which may be composed
 * bitwise by the constants defined in the enum #MeshSmoothing (see there for
 * the possibilities).
 *
 * @note While it is possible to pass all of the flags in #MeshSmoothing to
 * objects of type parallel::distributed::Triangulation, it is not always
 * possible to honor all of these smoothing options if they would require
 * knowledge of refinement/coarsening flags on cells not locally owned by this
 * processor. As a consequence, for some of these flags, the ultimate number
 * of cells of the parallel triangulation may depend on the number of
 * processors into which it is partitioned.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Material and boundary information</h3>
 *
 * Each cell, face or edge stores information denoting the material or the
 * part of the boundary that an object belongs to. The material of a cell may
 * be used during matrix generation in order to implement different
 * coefficients in different parts of the domain. It is not used by functions
 * of the grid and dof handling libraries.
 *
 * This material_id may be set upon construction of a triangulation (through
 * the CellData data structure), or later through use of cell iterators. For a
 * typical use of this functionality, see the step-28 tutorial program. The
 * functions of the GridGenerator namespace typically set the material ID of
 * all cells to zero. When reading a triangulation, the material id must be
 * specified in the input file (UCD format) or is otherwise set to zero.
 * Material IDs are inherited by child cells from their parent upon mesh
 * refinement.
 *
 * Boundary indicators on lower dimensional objects (these have no material
 * id) indicate the number of a boundary component. These are used for two
 * purposes: First, they specify a boundary curve. When a cell is refined, a
 * function can be used to place new vertices on this curve. See the section
 * on boundary approximation below. Furthermore, the weak formulation of the
 * partial differential equation may have different boundary conditions on
 * different parts of the boundary. The boundary indicator can be used in
 * creating the matrix or the right hand side vector to indicate these
 * different parts of the model (this use is like the material id of cells).
 * Boundary indicators may be in the range from zero to
 * numbers::internal_face_boundary_id-1. The value
 * numbers::internal_face_boundary_id is reserved to denote interior lines (in
 * 2D) and interior lines and quads (in 3D), which do not have a boundary
 * indicator. This way, a program can easily determine, whether such an object
 * is at the boundary or not. Material indicators may be in the range from
 * zero to numbers::invalid_material_id-1.
 *
 * Lines in two dimensions and quads in three dimensions inherit their
 * boundary indicator to their children upon refinement. You should therefore
 * make sure that if you have different boundary parts, the different parts
 * are separated by a vertex (in 2D) or a line (in 3D) such that each boundary
 * line or quad has a unique boundary indicator.
 *
 * By default (unless otherwise specified during creation of a triangulation),
 * all parts of the boundary have boundary indicator zero. As a historical
 * wart, this isn't true for 1d meshes, however: For these, leftmost vertices
 * have boundary indicator zero while rightmost vertices have boundary
 * indicator one. In either case, the boundary indicator of a face can be
 * changed using a call of the kind
 * <code>cell-@>face(1)-@>set_boundary_indicator(42);</code>.
 *
 * @see
 * @ref GlossBoundaryIndicator "Glossary entry on boundary indicators"
 *
 *
 * <h3>History of a triangulation</h3>
 *
 * It is possible to reconstruct a grid from its refinement history, which can
 * be stored and loaded through the @p save_refine_flags and @p
 * load_refine_flags functions. Normally, the code will look like this:
 *   @code
 *                                 // open output file
 *     ofstream history("mesh.history");
 *                                 // do 10 refinement steps
 *     for (int step=0; step<10; ++step) {
 *       ...;
 *       // flag cells according to some criterion
 *       ...;
 *       tria.save_refine_flags (history);
 *       tria.execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *     };
 *   @endcode
 *
 * If you want to re-create the grid from the stored information, you write:
 *   @code
 *                                 // open input file
 *     ifstream history("mesh.history");
 *                                 // do 10 refinement steps
 *     for (int step=0; step<10; ++step) {
 *       tria.load_refine_flags (history);
 *       tria.execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *     };
 *   @endcode
 *
 * The same scheme is employed for coarsening and the coarsening flags.
 *
 * You may write other information to the output file between different sets
 * of refinement information, as long as you read it upon re-creation of the
 * grid. You should make sure that the other information in the new
 * triangulation which is to be created from the saved flags, matches that of
 * the old triangulation, for example the smoothing level; if not, the cells
 * actually created from the flags may be other ones, since smoothing adds
 * additional cells, but their number may be depending on the smoothing level.
 *
 * There actually are two sets of <tt>save_*_flags</tt> and
 * <tt>load_*_flags</tt> functions. One takes a stream as argument and
 * reads/writes the information from/to the stream, thus enabling storing
 * flags to files. The other set takes an argument of type
 * <tt>vector<bool></tt>. This enables the user to temporarily store some
 * flags, e.g. if another function needs them, and restore them afterwards.
 *
 *
 * <h3>User flags and data</h3>
 *
 * A triangulation offers one bit per line, quad, etc for user flags. This
 * field can be accessed as all other data using iterators. Normally, this
 * user flag is used if an algorithm walks over all cells and needs
 * information whether another cell, e.g. a neighbor, has already been
 * processed. See
 * @ref GlossUserFlags "the glossary for more information".
 *
 * There is another set of user data, which can be either an <tt>unsigned
 * int</tt> or a <tt>void *</tt>, for each line, quad, etc. You can access
 * these through the functions listed under <tt>User data</tt> in the accessor
 * classes. Again, see
 * @ref GlossUserData "the glossary for more information".
 *
 * The value of these user indices or pointers is @p NULL by default. Note
 * that the pointers are not inherited to children upon refinement. Still,
 * after a remeshing they are available on all cells, where they were set on
 * the previous mesh.
 *
 * The usual warning about the missing type safety of @p void pointers are
 * obviously in place here; responsibility for correctness of types etc lies
 * entirely with the user of the pointer.
 *
 * @note User pointers and user indices are stored in the same place. In order
 * to avoid unwanted conversions, Triangulation checks which one of them is in
 * use and does not allow access to the other one, until clear_user_data() has
 * been called.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Boundary approximation</h3>
 *
 * You can specify a boundary function for each boundary component. If a new
 * vertex is created on a side or face at the boundary, this function is used
 * to compute where it will be placed. The boundary indicator of the face will
 * be used to determine the proper component. See Boundary for the details.
 * Usage with the Triangulation object is then like this (let @p Ball be a
 * class derived from Boundary<tt><2></tt>):
 *
 *   @code
 *     void main () {
 *       Triangulation<2> tria;
 *                                        // set the boundary function
 *                                        // for all boundaries with
 *                                        // boundary indicator 0
 *       Ball ball;
 *       tria.set_boundary (0, ball);
 *
 *       // read some coarse grid
 *
 *
 *       Triangulation<2>::active_cell_iterator cell, endc;
 *       for (int i=0; i<8; ++i)
 *         {
 *           cell = tria.begin_active();
 *           endc = tria.end();
 *
 *                                            // refine all
 *                                            // boundary cells
 *           for (; cell!=endc; ++cell)
 *             if (cell->at_boundary())
 *               cell->set_refine_flag();
 *
 *           tria.execute_coarsening_and_refinement();
 *         };
 *     };
 *   @endcode
 *
 * You should take note of one caveat: if you have concave boundaries, you
 * must make sure that a new boundary vertex does not lie too much inside the
 * cell which is to be refined. The reason is that the center vertex is placed
 * at the point which is the arithmetic mean of the vertices of the original
 * cell. Therefore if your new boundary vertex is too near the center of the
 * old quadrilateral or hexahedron, the distance to the midpoint vertex will
 * become too small, thus generating distorted cells. This issue is discussed
 * extensively in
 * @ref GlossDistorted "distorted cells".
 *
 *
 * <h3>Getting notice when a triangulation changes</h3>
 *
 * There are cases where one object would like to know whenever a
 * triangulation is being refined, copied, or modified in a number of other
 * ways. This could of course be achieved if, in your user code, you tell
 * every such object whenever you are about to refine the triangulation, but
 * this will get tedious and is error prone. The Triangulation class
 * implements a more elegant way to achieve this: signals.
 *
 * In essence, a signal is an object (a member of the Triangulation class)
 * that another object can connect to. A connection is in essence that the
 * connecting object passes a function object taking a certain number and kind
 * of arguments. Whenever the owner of the signal wants to indicate a certain
 * kind of event, it 'triggers' the signal, which in turn means that all
 * connections of the signal are triggered: in other word, the function
 * objects are executed and can take the action that is necessary.
 *
 * As a simple example, the following code will print something to the output
 * every time the triangulation has just been refined:
 *   @code
 *     void f() {
 *       std::cout << "Triangulation has been refined." << std::endl;
 *     }
 *
 *     void f() {
 *       Triangulation<dim> triangulation;
 *       // fill it somehow
 *       triangulation.signals.post_refinement.connect (&f);
 *       triangulation.refine_global (2);
 *   @endcode
 * This code will produce output twice, once for each refinement cycle.
 *
 * A more interesting application would be the following, akin to what the
 * FEValues class does. This class stores a pointer to a triangulation and
 * also an iterator to the cell last handled (so that it can compare the
 * current cell with the previous one and, for example, decide that there is
 * no need to re-compute the Jacobian matrix if the new cell is a simple
 * translation of the previous one). However, whenever the triangulation is
 * modified, the iterator to the previously handled cell needs to be
 * invalidated since it now no longer points to any useful cell (or, at the
 * very least, points to something that may not necessarily resemble the cells
 * previously handled). The code would look something like this (the real code
 * has some more error checking and has to handle the case that subsequent
 * cells might actually belong to different triangulation, but that is of no
 * concern to us here):
 *   @code
 *     template <int dim>
 *     class FEValues {
 *         Triangulation<dim>::active_cell_iterator current_cell, previous_cell;
 *       public:
 *         void reinit (Triangulation<dim>::active_cell_iterator &cell);
 *         void invalidate_previous_cell ();
 *     };
 *
 *     template <int dim>
 *     void
 *     FEValues<dim>::reinit (Triangulation<dim>::active_cell_iterator &cell) {
 *       if (previous_cell.status() != valid)
 *         {
 *           // previous_cell has not been set. set it now, and register
 *           // with the triangulation that we want to be informed about
 *           // mesh refinement
 *           previous_cell = current_cell;
 *           previous_cell.get_tria().signals.post_refinement
 *             .connect (std_cxx11::bind (&FEValues<dim>::invalidate_previous_cell,
 *                                        std_cxx11::ref (*this)));
 *         }
 *       else
 *         previous_cell = current_cell;
 *
 *       current_cell = cell;
 *       ... do something with the cell...
 *     }
 *
 *
 *     template <int dim>
 *     void
 *     FEValues<dim>::invalidate_previous_cell () {
 *       previous_cell = Triangulation<dim>::active_cell_iterator();
 *     }
 *   @endcode
 * Here, whenever the triangulation is refined, it triggers the post-
 * refinement signal which calls the function object attached to it. This
 * function object is the member function
 * <code>FEValues<dim>::invalidate_previous_cell</code> where we have bound
 * the single argument (the <code>this</code> pointer of a member function
 * that otherwise takes no arguments) to the <code>this</code> pointer of the
 * FEValues object. Note how here there is no need for the code that owns the
 * triangulation and the FEValues object to inform the latter if the former is
 * refined. (In practice, the function would want to connect to some of the
 * other signals that the triangulation offers as well, in particular to
 * creation and deletion signals.)
 *
 * The Triangulation class has a variety of signals that indicate different
 * actions by which the triangulation can modify itself and potentially
 * require follow-up action elsewhere: - creation: This signal is triggered
 * whenever the Triangulation::create_triangulation or
 * Triangulation::copy_triangulation is called. This signal is also triggered
 * when loading a triangulation from an archive via Triangulation::load. -
 * pre-refinement: This signal is triggered at the beginning of execution of
 * the Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement function (which is
 * itself called by other functions such as Triangulation::refine_global). At
 * the time this signal is triggered, the triangulation is still unchanged. -
 * post-refinement: This signal is triggered at the end of execution of the
 * Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement function when the
 * triangulation has reached its final state - copy: This signal is triggered
 * whenever the triangulation owning the signal is copied by another
 * triangulation using Triangulation::copy_triangulation (i.e. it is triggered
 * on the <i>old</i> triangulation, but the new one is passed as a argument).
 * - clear: This signal is triggered whenever the Triangulation::clear
 * function is called. This signal is also triggered when loading a
 * triangulation from an archive via Triangulation::load as the previous
 * content of the triangulation is first destroyed. - any_change: This is a
 * catch-all signal that is triggered whenever the create, post_refinement, or
 * clear signals are triggered. In effect, it can be used to indicate to an
 * object connected to the signal that the triangulation has been changed,
 * whatever the exact cause of the change.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Serializing (loading or storing) triangulations</h3>
 *
 * Like many other classes in deal.II, the Triangulation class can stream its
 * contents to an archive using BOOST's serialization facilities. The data so
 * stored can later be retrieved again from the archive to restore the
 * contents of this object. This facility is frequently used to save the state
 * of a program to disk for possible later resurrection, often in the context
 * of checkpoint/restart strategies for long running computations or on
 * computers that aren't very reliable (e.g. on very large clusters where
 * individual nodes occasionally fail and then bring down an entire MPI job).
 *
 * For technical reasons, writing and restoring a Triangulation object is not-
 * trivial. The primary reason is that unlike many other objects,
 * triangulations rely on many other objects to which they store pointers or
 * with which they interace; for example, triangulations store pointers to
 * objects describing boundaries and manifolds, and they have signals that
 * store pointers to other objects so they can be notified of changes in the
 * triangulation (see the section on signals in this introduction). As objects
 * that are re-loaded at a later time do not usually end up at the same
 * location in memory as they were when they were saved, dealing with pointers
 * to other objects is difficult.
 *
 * For these reasons, saving a triangulation to an archive does not store all
 * information, but only certain parts. More specifically, the information
 * that is stored is everything that defines the mesh such as vertex
 * locations, vertex indices, how vertices are connected to cells, boundary
 * indicators, subdomain ids, material ids, etc. On the other hand, the
 * following information is not stored: - signals - pointers to boundary
 * objects previously set using Triangulation::set_boundary On the other hand,
 * since these are objects that are usually set in user code, they can
 * typically easily be set again in that part of your code in which you re-
 * load triangulations.
 *
 * In a sense, this approach to serialization means that re-loading a
 * triangulation is more akin to calling the
 * Triangulation::create_triangulation function and filling it with some
 * additional content, as that function also does not touch the signals and
 * boundary objects that belong to this triangulation. In keeping with this
 * analogy, the Triangulation::load function also triggers the same kinds of
 * signal as Triangulation::create_triangulation.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Technical details</h3>
 *
 * <h4>Algorithms for mesh regularization and smoothing upon refinement</h4>
 *
 * We chose an inductive point of view: since upon creation of the
 * triangulation all cells are on the same level, all regularity assumptions
 * regarding the maximum difference in level of cells sharing a common face,
 * edge or vertex hold. Since we use the regularization and smoothing in each
 * step of the mesh history, when coming to the point of refining it further
 * the assumptions also hold.
 *
 * The regularization and smoothing is done in the @p
 * prepare_coarsening_and_refinement function, which is called by @p
 * execute_coarsening_and_refinement at the very beginning.  It decides which
 * additional cells to flag for refinement by looking at the old grid and the
 * refinement flags for each cell.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> <em>Regularization:</em> The algorithm walks over all cells checking
 * whether the present cell is flagged for refinement and a neighbor of the
 * present cell is refined once less than the present one. If so, flag the
 * neighbor for refinement. Because of the induction above, there may be no
 * neighbor with level two less than the present one.
 *
 * The neighbor thus flagged for refinement may induce more cells which need
 * to be refined. However, such cells which need additional refinement always
 * are on one level lower than the present one, so we can get away with only
 * one sweep over all cells if we do the loop in the reverse way, starting
 * with those on the highest level. This way, we may flag additional cells on
 * lower levels, but if these induce more refinement needed, this is performed
 * later on when we visit them in out backward running loop.
 *
 * <li> <em>Smoothing:</em>
 * <ul>
 * <li> @p limit_level_difference_at_vertices: First a list is set up which
 * stores for each vertex the highest level one of the adjacent cells belongs
 * to. Now, since we did smoothing in the previous refinement steps also, each
 * cell may only have vertices with levels at most one greater than the level
 * of the present cell.
 *
 * However, if we store the level plus one for cells marked for refinement, we
 * may end up with cells which have vertices of level two greater than the
 * cells level. We need to refine this cell also, and need thus also update
 * the levels of its vertices. This itself may lead to cells needing
 * refinement, but these are on lower levels, as above, which is why we may do
 * all kinds of additional flagging in one loop only.
 *
 * <li> @p eliminate_unrefined_islands: For each cell we count the number of
 * neighbors which are refined or flagged for refinement. If this exceeds the
 * number of neighbors which are not refined and not flagged for refinement,
 * then the current cell is flagged for refinement. Since this may lead to
 * cells on the same level which also will need refinement, we will need
 * additional loops of regularization and smoothing over all cells until
 * nothing changes any more.
 *
 * <li> <tt>eliminate_refined_*_islands</tt>: This one does much the same as
 * the above one, but for coarsening. If a cell is flagged for refinement or
 * if all of its children are active and if the number of neighbors which are
 * either active and not flagged for refinement, or not active but all
 * children flagged for coarsening equals the total number of neighbors, then
 * this cell's children are flagged for coarsening or (if this cell was
 * flagged for refinement) the refine flag is cleared.
 *
 * For a description of the distinction between the two versions of the flag
 * see above in the section about mesh smoothing in the general part of this
 * classes description.
 *
 * The same applies as above: several loops may be necessary.
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Regularization and smoothing are a bit complementary in that we check
 * whether we need to set additional refinement flags when being on a cell
 * flagged for refinement (regularization) or on a cell not flagged for
 * refinement. This makes readable programming easier.
 *
 * All the described algorithms apply only for more than one space dimension,
 * since for one dimension no restrictions apply. It may be necessary to apply
 * some smoothing for multigrid algorithms, but this has to be decided upon
 * later.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Warning</h3>
 *
 * It seems impossible to preserve @p constness of a triangulation through
 * iterator usage. Thus, if you declare pointers to a @p const triangulation
 * object, you should be well aware that you might involuntarily alter the
 * data stored in the triangulation.
