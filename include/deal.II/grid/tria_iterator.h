/**
 * This class implements an iterator, analogous to those of the standard
 * template library (STL). It fulfills the requirements of a bidirectional
 * iterator.  See the C++ documentation for further details of iterator
 * specification and usage.
 *
 *
 * In addition to the STL iterators an iterator of this class provides a
 * <tt>-@></tt> operator, i.e. you can write statements like
 * @code
 * i->set_refine_flag ();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Iterators are used whenever a loop over all lines, quads, cells etc.  is to
 * be performed. These loops can then be coded like this:
 * @code
 *   cell_iterator i   = tria.begin();
 *   cell_iterator end = tria.end();
 *   for (; i!=end; ++i)
 *     if (cell->at_boundary())
 *       cell->set_refine_flag();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note the usage of <tt>++i</tt> instead of <tt>i++</tt> since this does not
 * involve temporaries and copying. It is recommended to use a fixed value
 * <tt>end</tt> inside the loop instead of <tt>tria.end()</tt>, since the
 * creation and copying of these iterators is rather expensive compared to
 * normal pointers.
 *
 * The objects pointed to are accessors, derived from TriaAccessorBase. Which
 * kind of accessor is determined by the template argument <em>Accessor</em>.
 * These accessors are not so much data structures as they are a collection of
 * functions providing access to the data stored in Tringulation or DoFHandler
 * objects. Using these accessors, the structure of these classes is hidden
 * from the application program.
 *
 * <h3>Which iterator to use when</h3>
 *
 * @attention Application programs will rarely use TriaRawIterator, but rather
 * one of the derived classes TriaIterator or TriaActiveIterator.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> TriaRawIterator objects point to lines, cells, etc in the lists
 * whether they are used or not (in the vectors, also <i>dead</i> objects are
 * stored, since deletion in vectors is expensive and we also do not want to
 * destroy the ordering induced by the numbering in the vectors). Therefore
 * not all raw iterators point to valid objects.
 *
 * <li> The derived class TriaIterator selects the valid cells, that is, cells
 * used somewhere in the triangulation hierarchy.
 *
 * <li> TriaActiveIterator objects which only loop over active cells.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Purpose</h3>
 *
 * Iterators are not much slower than operating directly on the data
 * structures, since they perform the loops that you had to handcode yourself
 * anyway. Most iterator and accessor functions are inlined.
 *
 * The main functionality of iterators, resides in the <tt>++</tt> and
 * <tt>--</tt> operators. These move the iterator forward or backward just as
 * if it were a pointer into an array. Here, this operation is not so easy,
 * since it may include skipping some elements and the transition between the
 * triangulation levels. This is completely hidden from the user, though you
 * can still create an iterator pointing to an arbitrary element.  Actually,
 * the operation of moving iterators back and forth is not done in the
 * iterator classes, but rather in the accessor classes. Since these are
 * passed as template arguments, you can write your own versions here to add
 * more functionality.
 *
 * Furthermore, the iterators described here satisfy the requirement of input
 * and bidirectional iterators as stated by the C++ standard and the STL
 * documentation. It is therefore possible to use the functions from the
 * algorithm section of the C++ standard, e.g. <em>count_if</em> (see the
 * documentation for Triangulation for an example) and several others.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 *
 * The iterator class itself does not have much functionality. It only becomes
 * useful when assigned an Accessor (the second template parameter), which
 * really does the access to data. An Accessor has to fulfil some
 * requirements:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> It must have two members named <tt>present_level</tt> and
 * <tt>present_index</tt> storing the address of the element in the
 * triangulation presently pointed to. These data have to be accessible by all
 * triangulation iterators listed above.
 *
 * <li> It must have a constructor which takes a Triangulation* and two
 * unsigned integers, denoting the initial level and index, as well as a data
 * object depending on its type.
 *
 * <li> For the TriaIterator and the TriaActiveIterator class, it must have a
 * member function <tt>bool used()</tt>, for the latter a member function
 * <tt>bool active()</tt>.
 *
 * <li> It must have void operators <tt>++</tt> and <tt>--</tt>.
 *
 * <li> It must declare a local <tt>typedef AccessorData</tt> which states the
 * data type the accessor expects to get passed as fourth constructor
 * argument. By declaring a local data type, the respective iterator class may
 * type-safely enforce that data type to be one of its own constructor
 * argument types. If an accessor class does not need additional data, this
 * type shall be <tt>void</tt>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Then the iterator is able to do what it is supposed to. All of the
 * necessary functions are implemented in the <tt>Accessor</tt> base class,
 * but you may write your own version (non-virtual, since we use templates) to
 * add functionality.
 *
 * The accessors provided by the library consists of two groups, determined by
 * whether they access the data of Triangulation objects or
 * DoFHandler/hp::DoFHandler objects. They are derived from TriaAccessor and
 * DoFAccessor, respectively. Each group also has specialized accessors for
 * cells (as opposed to faces and lines) that offer more functionality such as
 * accessing neighbors.
 *
 * @attention It seems impossible to preserve constness of a triangulation
 * through iterator usage. Thus, if you declare pointers to a <tt>const</tt>
 * triangulation object, you should be well aware that you might involuntarily
 * alter the data stored in the triangulation.
 *
 * @note More information on valid and invalid iterators can be found in the
 * documentation of TriaAccessorBase, where the iterator states are checked
 * and implemented.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Past-the-end iterators</h3>
 *
 * There is a representation of past-the-end-pointers, denoted by special
 * values of the member variables @p present_level and @p present_index: If
 * <tt>present_level>=0</tt> and <tt>present_index>=0</tt>, then the object is
 * valid (there is no check whether the triangulation really has that many
 * levels or that many cells on the present level when we investigate the
 * state of an iterator; however, in many places where an iterator is
 * dereferenced we make this check); if <tt>present_level==-1</tt> and
 * <tt>present_index==-1</tt>, then the iterator points past the end; in all
 * other cases, the iterator is considered invalid. You can check this by
 * calling the <tt>state()</tt> function.
 *
 * An iterator is also invalid, if the pointer pointing to the Triangulation
 * object is invalid or zero.
 *
 * Finally, an iterator is invalid, if the element pointed to by @p
 * present_level and @p present_index is not used, i.e. if the @p used flag is
 * set to false.
 *
 * The last two checks are not made in <tt>state()</tt> since both cases
 * should only occur upon unitialized construction through @p memcpy and the
 * like (the parent triangulation can only be set upon construction). If an
 * iterator is constructed empty through the empty constructor,
 * <tt>present_level==-2</tt> and <tt>present_index==-2</tt>. Thus, the
 * iterator is invalid anyway, regardless of the state of the triangulation
 * pointer and the state of the element pointed to.
 *
 * Past-the-end iterators may also be used to compare an iterator with the <i
 * >before-the-start</i> value, when running backwards. There is no
 * distinction between the iterators pointing past the two ends of a vector.
 *
 * By defining only one value to be past-the-end and making all other values
 * invalid provides a second track of security: if we should have forgotten a
 * check in the library when an iterator is incremented or decremented, we
 * automatically convert the iterator from the allowed state "past-the-end" to
 * the disallowed state "invalid" which increases the chance that somehwen
 * earlier than for past-the-end iterators an exception is raised.
