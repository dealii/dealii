/**
 * This class provides a map between two grids which are derived from the same
 * coarse grid. For each cell iterator of the source map, it provides the
 * respective cell iterator on the destination map, through its <tt>operator
 * []</tt>.
 *
 * Usually, the two grids will be refined differently. Then, the value
 * returned for an iterator on the source grid will be either:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The same cell on the destination grid, if it exists there;
 * <li> The most refined cell of the destination grid from which the pendant
 * of the source cell could be obtained by refinement. This cell is always
 * active and has a refinement level less than that of the source cell.
 * </ul>
 * Keys for this map are all cells on the source grid, whether active or not.
 *
 * For example, consider these two one-dimensional grids:
 * @verbatim
 * Grid 1:
 *   x--x--x-----x-----------x
 *    1  2    3        4
 *
 * Grid 2:
 *   x-----x-----x-----x-----x
 *      1     2     3     4
 * @endverbatim
 * (Cell numbers are only given as an example and will not correspond to real
 * cell iterator's indices.) The mapping from grid 1 to grid 2 will then be as
 * follows:
 * @verbatim
 *    Cell on grid 1         Cell on grid 2
 *          1  ------------------>  1
 *          2  ------------------>  1
 *          3  ------------------>  2
 *          4  ------------------>  mother cell of cells 3 and 4
 *                                  (a non-active cell, not shown here)
 * @endverbatim
 * Besides the mappings shown here, the non-active cells on grid 1 are also
 * valid keys. For example, the mapping for the mother cell of cells 1 and 2
 * on the first grid will point to cell 1 on the second grid.
 *
 * The implementation of this class is such that not only cell iterators into
 * triangulations can be mapped, but also iterators into objects of type
 * DoFHandler or hp::DoFHandler. The extension to other classes offering
 * iterator functions and some minor additional requirements is simple.
 *
 * Note that this class could in principle be based on the C++
 * <tt>std::map<Key,Value></tt> data type. Instead, it uses another data
 * format which is more effective both in terms of computing time for access
 * as well as with regard to memory consumpion.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * In practice, use of this class is as follows:
 * @verbatim
 *                   // have two grids, which are derived from the
 *                   // same coarse grid
 *   Triangulation<dim> tria1, tria2;
 *   DoFHandler<dim> dof_handler_1(tria1), dof_handler_2(tria2);
 *   ...
 *                   // do something with these objects, e.g.
 *                   // refine the triangulations differently,
 *                   // distribute degrees of freedom, etc
 *   ...
 *                   // create the mapping
 *   InterGridMap<DoFHandler<dim> > grid_1_to_2_map;
 *   grid_1_to_2_map.make_mapping (dof_handler_1,
 *                                 dof_handler_2);
 *   ...
 *   typename DoFHandler<dim>::cell_iterator cell = dof_handler_1.begin(),
 *                                           endc = dof_handler_1.end();
 *   for (; cell!=endc; ++cell)
 *                    // now do something with the cell of dof_handler_2
 *                    // corresponding to @p cell (which is one of
 *                    // dof_handler_1
 *     f( grid_1_to_2_map[cell]);
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * Note that the template parameters to this class have to be given as
 * <tt>InterGridMap<DoFHandler<2> ></tt>, which here is DoFHandler (and could
 * equally well be Triangulation, PersistentTriangulation, or hp::DoFHandler).
