/**
 * We collect in this namespace all utilities which operate on OpenCASCADE
 * entities. OpenCASCADE splits every object into a topological description
 * and a geometrical entity. The basic topological description is a
 * TopoDS_Shape. TopoDS_Shapes are light objects, and can be copied around.
 * The closest deal.II analog is a TriaIterator.
 *
 * The OpenCASCADE topology is designed with reference to the STEP standard
 * ISO-10303-42.  The structure is an oriented one-way graph, where parents
 * refer to their children, and there are no back references. Abstract
 * structure is implemented as C++ classes from the TopoDS package. A
 * TopoDS_Shape is manipulated by value and contains 3 fields: location,
 * orientation and a myTShape handle (of the TopoDS_TShape type). According to
 * OpenCASCADE documentation, myTShape and Location are used to share data
 * between various shapes to save memory. For example, an edge belonging to
 * two faces has equal Locations and myTShape fields but different
 * Orientations (Forward in context of one face and Reversed in one of the
 * other).
 *
 * Valid shapes include collection of other shapes, solids, faces, edges,
 * vertices, etc.
 *
 * Once a topological description is available, if a concrete geometrical
 * object can be created, the BRep classes allow one to extract the actual
 * geometrical information from a shape.
 *
 * This is done by inheriting abstract topology classes from the TopoDS
 * package by those implementing a boundary representation model (from the
 * BRep package). Only 3 types of topological objects have geometric
 * representations - vertex, edge, and face.
 *
 * Every TopoDS_Shape can be queried to figure out what type of shape it is,
 * and actual geometrical objects, like surfaces, curves or points, can be
 * extracted using BRepTools.
 *
 * In this namespace we provide readers and writers that read standard CAD
 * files, and return a TopoDS_Shape, or that write a CAD file, given a
 * TopoDS_Shape. Most of the functions in the OpenCASCADE namespace deal with
 * TopoDS_Shapes of one type or another, and provide interfaces to common
 * deal.II objects, like Triangulation, Manifold, and so on.
 *
 * Notice that most of these tools are only useful when spacedim is equal to
 * three, since OpenCASCADE only operates in three-dimensional mode. In some
 * cases they can be used in two dimensions as well, and the third dimension
 * will be set to zero.
 *
 * If you wish to use these tools when the dimension of the space is two, then
 * make sure your CAD files are actually flat and that all z coordinates are
 * equal to zero, as otherwise you will get many exceptions.
