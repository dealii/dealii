   * onto the manifold along a direction which is an estimation of the

   *
   * The direction normal to the mesh is particularly useful because it is the
   * direction in which the mesh is missing nodes. For instance, during the
   * refinement of a cell a new node is initially created around the
   * baricenter of the cell. This location somehow ensures a uniform distance
   * from the nodes of the old cell. Projecting such cell baricenter onto the
   * CAD surface in the direction normal to the original cell will then retain
   * uniform distance from the points of the original cell. Of course, at the
   * stage of mesh generation, no dof handler nor finite element are defined,
   * and such direction has to be estimated. For the case in which 8
   * surrounding points are present, 4 different triangles are identified with
   * the points assigned, and the normals of such triangles are averaged to
   * obtain the approximation of the normal to the cell.
   *
   * The case in which 2 surrounding points are present (i.e.:a cell edge is
   * being refined) is of course more tricky. The average of the CAD surface
   * normals at the 2 surrounding points is first computed, and then projected
   * onto the plane normal to the segment linking the surrounding points. This
   * again is an attempt to have the new point with equal distance with
   * respect to the surrounding points
