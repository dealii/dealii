  /**
   * Compute constraints on the solution that corresponds to the imposition
   * of Dirichlet boundary conditions.  This function creates a map of
   * degrees of freedom subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions and the
   * corresponding values to be assigned to them, by interpolation around the
   * boundary. For each degree of freedom at the boundary, if its index
   * already exists in @p boundary_values then its boundary value will be
   * overwritten, otherwise a new entry with proper index and boundary value
   * for this degree of freedom will be inserted into @p boundary_values.
   *
   * The parameter @p function_map provides a list of boundary indicators to
   * be handled by this function and corresponding boundary value functions.
   * The keys of this map correspond to the number @p boundary_id of the face.
   * numbers::internal_face_boundary_id is an illegal value for this key since
   * it is reserved for interior faces. For an example of how to use this
   * argument with a non-empty map, see the step-16 tutorial program.
   *
   * The flags in the last parameter, @p component_mask denote which
   * components of the finite element space shall be interpolated. If it is
   * left as specified by the default value (i.e. an empty array), all
   * components are interpolated. If it is different from the default value,
   * it is assumed that the number of entries equals the number of components
   * in the boundary functions and the finite element, and those components in
   * the given boundary function will be used for which the respective flag
   * was set in the component mask. See also
   * @ref GlossComponentMask.
   * As an example, assume that you are solving the Stokes equations in 2d,
   * with variables $(u,v,p)$ and that you only want to interpolate boundary
   * values for the velocity, then the component mask should correspond to
   * <code>(true,true,false)</code>.
   *
   * @note Whether a component mask has been specified or not, the number of
   * components of the functions in @p function_map must match that of the
   * finite element used by @p dof. In other words, for the example above, you
   * need to provide a Function object that has 3 components (the two
   * velocities and the pressure), even though you are only interested in the
   * first two of them. interpolate_boundary_values() will then call this
   * function to obtain a vector of 3 values at each interpolation point but
   * only take the first two and discard the third. In other words, you are
   * free to return whatever you like in the third component of the vector
   * returned by Function::vector_value, but the Function object must state
   * that it has 3 components.
   *
   * If the finite element used has shape functions that are non-zero in more
   * than one component (in deal.II speak: they are non-primitive), then these
   * components can presently not be used for interpolating boundary values.
   * Thus, the elements in the component mask corresponding to the components
   * of these non-primitive shape functions must be @p false.
   *
   * See the general documentation of this namespace for more information.
   *
   * @note When solving a partial differential equation with boundary
   *   conditions $u|_{\partial\Omega}=g$ (or on *parts* of the boundary),
   *   then this boundary condition is in general not satisfiable exactly
   *   using finite elements in the form $u_h|_{\partial\Omega}=g$. That is
   *   because the function $g$ is generally not a polynomial, whereas
   *   $u_h|_{\partial\Omega}$ *is* a polynomial on each face of the
   *   mesh that is located at the boundary. In other words, it is in
   *   general not possible to *impose* such boundary condition; what one
   *   *can* do, however, is to impose
   *     @f[ u_h|_{\partial\Omega}=I_h^{\partial\Omega} g, @f]
   *   where $I_h^{\partial\Omega} g$ is a function that equals $g$ at each node
   *   of the finite element space located on the boundary, and is piecewise
   *   polynomial in between. In other words, $I_h^{\partial\Omega}$ is an
   *   *interpolation operator* and $I_h^{\partial\Omega} g$ are the
   *   interpolated boundary values -- thus the name. The use of
   *   $I_h^{\partial\Omega} g$ instead of $g$ as boundary values imposes
   *   an additional error (in the same spirit as using quadrature introduces
   *   an additional error compared to being able to compute the integrals of
   *   the weak form exactly). In most cases, this additional error is of the
   *   same order as the other error terms in the finite element method,
   *   though there are some subtle differences when measuring the error in
   *   the $L^2$ norm. For some details, see @cite Bartels2004 .
   *
   * @note An alternative to using the interpolant,
   *     @f[ u_h|_{\partial\Omega}=I_h^{\partial\Omega} g @f]
   *   is to use the *projection* of the boundary values $g$ onto the
   *   finite element space on the boundary:
   *     @f[ u_h|_{\partial\Omega}=\Pi_h^{\partial\Omega} g. @f]
   *   The projection is available using the project_boundary_values()
   *   function. Using the projection may have some theoretical advantages
   *   (see again @cite Bartels2004) but has the practical disadvantage
   *   that computing the projection is far more expensive than computing
   *   the interpolation because the latter can be done one face at a time
   *   whereas the projection requires the solution of a problem on the entire
   *   boundary. On the other hand, interpolation is only possible for
   *   "nodal" finite element spaces (such as FE_Q, but not
   *   FE_Q_Hierarchical), whereas the projection is always possible.

   * $u_h|_\Gamma$, i.e., the nodal values of the degrees of freedom of this
   * function along the boundary, are then what is computed by this function.
   *
   * In case this function is used with $H_{div}$ conforming finite element
   * space, the solution of a different problem is computed, namely: Find
   * $\vec{u}_h \in V_h \subset H(\text{div}; \Omega)$ so that

   * where $\vec{n}$ is an outward normal vector.
   *
   * This function throws exception if used with $H_{curl}$ conforming elements,
   * so the project_boundary_values_curl_conforming() should be used instead.
   *
   * @param[in] mapping The mapping that will be used in the transformations
   * necessary to integrate along the boundary.
   * @param[in] dof The DoFHandler that describes the finite element space and
   * the numbering of degrees of freedom.
   * @param[in] boundary_functions A map from boundary indicators to pointers
   * to functions that describe the desired values on those parts of the
   * boundary marked with this boundary indicator (see
   * @ref GlossBoundaryIndicator "Boundary indicator").
   * The projection happens on only those parts of the boundary whose

   * @param[in] q The face quadrature used in the integration necessary to
   * compute the mass matrix and right hand side of the projection.
   * @param[out] boundary_values The result of this function. It is a map
   * containing all indices of degrees of freedom at the boundary (as covered
   * by the boundary parts in @p boundary_functions) and the computed dof
   * value for this degree of freedom. For each degree of freedom at the
   * boundary, if its index already exists in @p boundary_values then its
   * boundary value will be overwritten, otherwise a new entry with proper
   * index and boundary value for this degree of freedom will be inserted into
   * @p boundary_values.
   * @param[in] component_mapping It is sometimes convenient to project a
   * vector-valued function onto only parts of a finite element space (for
   * example, to project a function with <code>dim</code> components onto the
   * velocity components of a <code>dim+1</code> component DoFHandler for a
   * Stokes problem). To allow for this, this argument allows components to be
   * remapped. If the vector is not empty, it has to have one entry for each
   * vector component of the finite element used in @p dof. This entry is the
   * component number in @p boundary_functions that should be used for this
   * component in @p dof. By default, no remapping is applied.
   *
   * @note Using the *projection* rather than the *interpolation* of
   *   boundary values makes relatively little difference in
   *   practice. That said, it is far more computationally expensive
   *   to compute projections because the require the solution of a
   *   problem that couples all unknowns on the boundary, whereas
   *   interpolation works on one face at a time. On the other hand,
   *   interpolation is only possible for "nodal" finite element
   *   spaces (such as FE_Q, but not FE_Q_Hierarchical), whereas the
   *   projection is always possible. (For some more theoretical

   * This function is an updated version of the
   * project_boundary_values_curl_conforming function. The intention is to fix
   * a problem when using the previous function in conjunction with non-
   * rectangular geometries (i.e. elements with non-rectangular faces). The
   * L2-projection method used has been taken from the paper "Electromagnetic
   * scattering simulation using an H (curl) conforming hp-finite element
   * method in three dimensions" by PD Ledger, K Morgan and O Hassan ( Int. J.
   * Num. Meth. Fluids, Volume 53, Issue 8, pages 1267-1296).
   *
   * This function will compute constraints that correspond to Dirichlet
   * boundary conditions of the form
   * $\vec{n}\times\vec{E}=\vec{n}\times\vec{F}$ i.e. the tangential
   * components of $\vec{E}$ and $f$ shall coincide.
   *
   * <h4>Computing constraints</h4>
   *
   * To compute the constraints we use a projection method based upon the
   * paper mentioned above. In 2D this is done in a single stage for the edge-
   * based shape functions, regardless of the order of the finite element. In
   * 3D this is done in two stages, edges first and then faces.
   *
   * For each cell, each edge, $e$, is projected by solving the linear system
   * $Ax=b$ where $x$ is the vector of constraints on degrees of freedom on the
   * edge and
   *
   * $A_{ij} = \int_{e} (\vec{s}_{i}\cdot\vec{t})(\vec{s}_{j}\cdot\vec{t}) dS$
   *
   * $b_{i} = \int_{e} (\vec{s}_{i}\cdot\vec{t})(\vec{F}\cdot\vec{t}) dS$
   *
   * with $\vec{s}_{i}$ the $i^{th}$ shape function and $\vec{t}$ the tangent
   * vector.
   *
   * Once all edge constraints, $x$, have been computed, we may compute the
   * face constraints in a similar fashion, taking into account the residuals
   * from the edges.
   *
   * For each face on the cell, $f$, we solve the linear system $By=c$ where
   * $y$ is the vector of constraints on degrees of freedom on the face and
   *
   * $B_{ij} = \int_{f} (\vec{n} \times \vec{s}_{i}) \cdot (\vec{n} \times
   * \vec{s}_{j}) dS$
   *
   * $c_{i} = \int_{f} (\vec{n} \times \vec{r}) \cdot (\vec{n} \times
   * \vec{s}_i) dS$
   *
   * and $\vec{r} = \vec{F} - \sum_{e \in f} \sum{i \in e} x_{i}\vec{s}_i$,
   * the edge residual.
   *
   * The resulting constraints are then given in the solutions $x$ and $y$.
   *
   * If the AffineConstraints @p constraints contained values or other
   * constraints before, the new ones are added or the old ones overwritten,
   * if a node of the boundary part to be used was already in the list of
   * constraints. This is handled by using inhomogeneous constraints. Please
   * note that when combining adaptive meshes and this kind of constraints,
   * the Dirichlet conditions should be set first, and then completed by
   * hanging node constraints, in order to make sure that the discretization
   * remains consistent. See the discussion on conflicting constraints in the
   * module on
   * @ref constraints.
   *
   * <h4>Arguments to this function</h4>
   *
   * This function is explicitly for use with FE_Nedelec elements, or with
   * FESystem elements which contain FE_Nedelec elements. It will throw an
   * exception if called with any other finite element. The user must ensure
   * that FESystem elements are correctly setup when using this function as
   * this check not possible in this case.
   *
   * The second argument of this function denotes the first vector component
   * of the finite element which corresponds to the vector function that you
   * wish to constrain. For example, if we are solving Maxwell's equations in
   * 3D and have components $(E_x,E_y,E_z,B_x,B_y,B_z)$ and we want the
   * boundary conditions $\vec{n}\times\vec{B}=\vec{n}\times\vec{f}$, then @p
   * first_vector_component would be 3. The @p boundary_function must return 6
   * components in this example, with the first 3 corresponding to $\vec{E}$
   * and the second 3 corresponding to $\vec{B}$. Vectors are implicitly
   * assumed to have exactly <code>dim</code> components that are ordered in
   * the same way as we usually order the coordinate directions, i.e. $x$-,
   * $y$-, and finally $z$-component.
   *
   * The parameter @p boundary_component corresponds to the number @p
   * boundary_id of the face. numbers::internal_face_boundary_id is an illegal
   * value, since it is reserved for interior faces.
   *
   * The last argument is denoted to compute the normal vector $\vec{n}$ at
   * the boundary points.
