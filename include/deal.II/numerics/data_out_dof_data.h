//TODO: Most of the documentation of DataOut_DoFData applies to DataOut.

/**
 * This is an abstract class which provides the functionality to generate
 * patches for output by base classes from data vectors on a grid. It allows
 * to attach one or more pointers to a DoFHandler and attached node and cell
 * data denoting functions on the grid which shall later be written in any of
 * the implemented data formats.
 *
 *
 * <h3>User visible interface</h3>
 *
 * The user visible interface of this class allows the user to specify data in
 * two different ways. One is to make a DoFHandler object known to this class
 * and to add data vectors that all correspond to this DoFHandler or the grid
 * cells which will later be written to a file in some format. The second
 * approach is to pass a DoFHandler object along with the vector. This allows
 * setting data from different DoFHandlers in a neat way (of course, they both
 * need to be based on the same triangulation). Instead of pondering about the
 * different functions, an example for the first kind is probably the best
 * explanation:
 * @code
 *   ...
 *   ...   // compute solution, which contains nodal values
 *   ...
 *   ...   // compute error_estimator, which contains one value per cell
 *
 *   std::vector<std::string> solution_names;
 *   solution_names.push_back ("x-displacement");
 *   solution_names.push_back ("y-displacement");
 *
 *   DataOut<dim> data_out;
 *   data_out.attach_dof_handler (dof_handler);
 *   data_out.add_data_vector (solution, solution_names);
 *   data_out.add_data_vector (error_estimator, "estimated_error");
 *
 *   data_out.build_patches ();
 *
 *   ofstream output_file ("output");
 *   data_out.write_xxx (output_file);
 *
 *   data_out.clear();
 * @endcode
 *
 * attach_dof_handler() tells this class that all future operations are to
 * take place with the DoFHandler object and the triangulation it lives on. We
 * then add the solution vector and the error estimator; note that they have
 * different dimensions, because the solution is a nodal vector, here
 * consisting of two components ("x-displacement" and "y-displacement") while
 * the error estimator probably is a vector holding cell data. When attaching
 * a data vector, you have to give a name to each component of the vector,
 * which is done through an object of type <tt>vector<string></tt> as second
 * argument; if only one component is in the vector, for example if we are
 * adding cell data as in the second case, or if the finite element used by
 * the DoFHandler has only one component, then you can use the second
 * add_data_vector() function which takes a @p string instead of the
 * <tt>vector<string></tt>.
 *
 * The add_data_vector() functions have additional arguments (with default
 * values) that can be used to specify certain transformations. In particular,
 * it allows to attach DataPostprocessor arguments to compute derived
 * information from a data vector at each point at which the field will be
 * evaluated so that it can be written to a file (for example, the Mach number
 * in hypersonic flow can be computed from density and velocities; step-29
 * also shows an example); another piece of information specified through
 * arguments with default values is how certain output components should be
 * interpreted, i.e. whether each component of the data is logically an
 * independent scalar field, or whether some of them together form logically a
 * vector-field (see the
 * DataComponentInterpretation::DataComponentInterpretation enum, and the
 * @ref step_22 "step-22"
 * tutorial program).
 *
 * This class does not copy the vector given to it through the
 * add_data_vector() functions, for memory consumption reasons. It only stores
 * a reference to it, so it is in your responsibility to make sure that the
 * data vectors exist long enough.
 *
 * After adding all data vectors, you need to call a function which generates
 * the patches (i.e., some intermediate data representation) for output from
 * the stored data. Derived classes name this function build_patches().
 * Finally, you write() the data in one format or other, to a file.
 *
 * In the example above, an object of type DataOut was used, i.e. an object of
 * a derived class. This is necessary since the current class does not provide
 * means to actually generate the patches, only aids to store and access data.
 * Any real functionality is implemented in derived classes such as DataOut.
 *
 * Note that the base class of this class, DataOutInterface offers several
 * functions to ease programming with run-time determinable output formats
 * (i.e. you need not use a fixed format by calling
 * DataOutInterface::write_xxx in the above example, but you can select it by
 * a run-time parameter without having to write the <tt>if () ... else
 * ...</tt> clauses yourself), and also functions and classes offering ways to
 * control the appearance of the output by setting flags for each output
 * format.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Information for derived classes</h3>
 *
 * What this class lacks is a way to produce the patches for output itself,
 * from the stored data and degree of freedom information. Since this task is
 * often application dependent it is left to derived classes. For example, in
 * many applications, it might be wanted to limit the depth of output to a
 * certain number of refinement levels and write data from finer cells only in
 * a way interpolated to coarser cells, to reduce the amount of output. Also,
 * it might be wanted to use different numbers of subdivisions on different
 * cells when forming a patch, for example to accomplish for different
 * polynomial degrees of the trial space on different cells. Also, the output
 * need not necessarily consist of a patch for each cell, but might be made up
 * of patches for faces, of other things. Take a look at derived classes to
 * what is possible in this respect.
 *
 * For this reason, it is left to a derived class to provide a function, named
 * usually build_patches() or the like, which fills the #patches array of this
 * class.
 *
 * Regarding the templates of this class, it needs three values: first the
 * space dimension in which the triangulation and the DoF handler operate,
 * second the dimension of the objects which the patches represent.  Although
 * in most cases they are equal, there are also classes for which this does
 * not hold, for example if one outputs the result of a computation exploiting
 * rotational symmetry in the original domain (in which the space dimension of
 * the output would be one higher than that of the DoF handler, see the
 * DataOut_Rotation() class), or one might conceive that one could write a
 * class that only outputs the solution on a cut through the domain, in which
 * case the space dimension of the output is less than that of the DoF
 * handler. The last template argument denotes the dimension of the space into
 * which the patches are embedded; usually, this dimension is the same as the
 * dimensio of the patches themselves (which is also the default value of the
 * template parameter), but there might be cases where this is not so. For
 * example, in the DataOut_Faces() class, patches are generated from faces of
 * the triangulation. Thus, the dimension of the patch is one less than the
 * dimension of the embedding space, which is, in this case, equal to the
 * dimension of the triangulation and DoF handler. However, for the cut
 * through the domain mentioned above, if the cut is a straight one, then the
 * cut can be embedded into a space of one dimension lower than the dimension
 * of the triangulation, so that the last template parameter has the same
 * value as the second one.

   * A pointer to the vector is stored, so you have to make sure the vector

   * functions.
   *
   * It is assumed that the vector has the same number of components as there

   * be a vector storing nodal data; or the size may be the number of active
   * cells on the present grid, in which case it is assumed to be a cell data

   * does not work.  One example is if you compute with piecewise constant
   * elements and have a scalar solution, then there are as many cells as
   * there are degrees of freedom (though they may be numbered differently).
   * Another possibility is if you have a 1d mesh embedded in 2d space and the

   * nodes as there are cells, and when using a Q1 element you will have as
   * many degrees of freedom as there are cells.  In these cases, you can
   * change the last argument of the function from its default value
   * #type_automatic to either #type_dof_data or #type_cell_data, depending on
   * what the vector represents. Apart from such corner cases, you can leave
   * the argument at its default value and let the function determine the type
   * of the vector itself.
   *
   * If it is a vector holding DoF data, the names given shall be one for each
   * component of the underlying finite element.  If it is a finite element
   * composed of only one subelement, then there is another function following
   * which takes a single name instead of a vector of names.
   *
   * The data_component_interpretation argument contains information about how
   * the individual components of output files that consist of more than one
   * data set are to be interpreted.
   *
   * For example, if one has a finite element for the Stokes equations in 2d,
   * representing components (u,v,p), one would like to indicate that the
   * first two, u and v, represent a logical vector so that later on when we
   * generate graphical output we can hand them off to a visualization program
   * that will automatically know to render them as a vector field, rather
   * than as two separate and independent scalar fields.
   *
   * The default value of this argument (i.e. an empty vector) corresponds is
   * equivalent to a vector of values
   * DataComponentInterpretation::component_is_scalar, indicating that all
   * output components are independent scalar fields. However, if the given
   * data vector represents logical vectors, you may pass a vector that
   * contains values DataComponentInterpretation::component_is_part_of_vector.
   * In the example above, one would pass in a vector with components
   * (DataComponentInterpretation::component_is_part_of_vector,
   * DataComponentInterpretation::component_is_part_of_vector,
   * DataComponentInterpretation::component_is_scalar) for (u,v,p).
   *
   * The names of a data vector shall only contain characters which are
   * letters, underscore and a few other ones. Refer to the
   * ExcInvalidCharacter exception declared in this class to see which
   * characters are valid and which are not.
   *
   * @note The actual type for the vector argument may be any vector type from
   * which FEValues can extract values on a cell using the
   * FEValuesBase::get_function_values() function. In particular, this
