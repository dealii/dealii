/**
 * This class provides an abstract interface to time dependent problems in
 * that it addresses some of the most annoying aspects of this class of
 * problems: data management. These problems frequently need large amounts of
 * computer ressources, most notably computing time, main memory and disk
 * space. Main memory reduction is often the most pressing need, methods to
 * implement it are almost always quite messy, though, quickly leading to code
 * that stores and reloads data at places scattered all over the program, and
 * which becomes unmaintainable sometimes. The present class tries to offer a
 * more structured interface, albeit simple, which emerged in my mind after
 * messing with my wave equation simulation for several months.
 *
 * The design of this class is mostly tailored for the solution of time
 * dependent partial differential equations where the computational meshes may
 * differ between each two timesteps and where the computations on each time
 * step take a rather long time compared with the overhead of this class.
 * Since no reference to the class of problems is made within this class, it
 * is not restricted to PDEs, though, and it seems likely that a solver for
 * large ordinary matrix differential equations may successfully use the same
 * setup and therefore this class.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Overview</h3>
 *
 * The general structure of a time dependent problem solver using a
 * timestepping scheme is about the following: we have a collection of time
 * step objects on which we solve our problem subsequently. In order to do so,
 * we need knowledge of the data on zero or several previous timesteps (when
 * using single or multiple step methods, that is) and maybe also some data of
 * time steps ahead (for example the computational grid on these). Dependening
 * on the problem in question, a second loop over all timesteps may be done
 * solving a dual problem, where the loop may run forward (one dual problem
 * for each time step) or backward (using a global dual problem). Within one
 * of these loops or using a separate loop, error estimators may be computed
 * and the grids may be refined. Each of these loops are initiated by a call
 * preparing each timestep object for the next loop, before actually starting
 * the loop itself.
 *
 * We will denote a complete set of all these loops with the term "sweep".
 * Since this library is mostly about adaptive methods, it is likely that the
 * last loop within a sweep will generate refined meshes and that we will
 * perform another sweep on these refined meshes. A total run will therefore
 * often be a sequence of several sweeps. The global setup therefore looks
 * like this:
 * @verbatim
 *    for sweep=0 to n_sweeps-1
 *    {
 *      for i=0 to n_timesteps-1
 *        initialize timestep i for this sweep, e.g. for setting up
 *        data structures, creating temporary files, etc.
 *
 *      for i=0 to n_timesteps-1
 *        prepare timestep i for loop 0
 *      for i=0 to n_timesteps-1
 *        perform loop 0 on timestep i   (e.g. solve primal problem)
 *
 *      for i=0 to n_timesteps-1
 *        prepare timestep i for loop 1
 *      for i=0 to n_timesteps-1
 *        perform loop 1 on timestep i   (e.g. solve dual problem)
 *
 *      for i=0 to n_timesteps-1
 *        prepare timestep i for loop 2
 *      for i=0 to n_timesteps-1
 *        perform loop 2 on timestep i   (e.g. compute error information)
 *
 *      ...
 *
 *      for i=0 to n_timesteps-1
 *        notify timestep i of the end of the sweep, e.g. for cleanups,
 *        deletion of temporary files, etc.
 *    }
 * @endverbatim
 * The user may specify that a loop shall run forward or backward (the latter
 * being needed for the solution of global dual problems, for example).
 *
 * Going from the global overview to a more local viewpoint, we note that when
 * a loop visits one timestep (e.g. to solve the primal or dual problem, or to
 * compute error information), we need information on this, one or more
 * previous time steps and zero or more timesteps in the future. However,
 * often it is not needed to know all information from these timesteps and it
 * is often a computational requirement to delete data at the first possible
 * time when it is no more needed. Likewise, data should be reloaded at the
 * latest time possible.
 *
 * In order to facilitate these principles, the concept of waking up and
 * letting sleep a time step object was developed. Assume we have a time
 * stepping scheme which needs to look ahead one time step and needs the data
 * of the last two time steps, the following pseudocode described what the
 * centeral loop function of this class will do when we move from timestep @p
 * n-1 to timestep @p n:
 * @verbatim
 *   wake up timestep n+1 with signal 1
 *   wake up timestep n with signal 0
 *   do computation on timestep n
 *   let timestep n sleep with signal 0
 *   let timestep n-1 sleep with signal 1
 *   let timestep n-2 sleep with signal 2
 *
 *   move from n to n+1
 * @endverbatim
 * The signal number here denotes the distance of the timestep being sent the
 * signal to the timestep where computations are done on. The calls to the @p
 * wake_up and @p sleep functions with signal 0 could in principle be absorbed
 * into the function doing the computation; we use these redundant signals,
 * however, in order to separate computations and data management from each
 * other, allowing to put all stuff around grid management, data reload and
 * storage into one set of functions and computations into another.
 *
 * In the example above, possible actions might be: timestep <tt>n+1</tt>
 * rebuilds the computational grid (there is a specialized class which can do
 * this for you); timestep @p n builds matrices sets solution vectors to the
 * right size, maybe using an initial guess; then it does the computations;
 * then it deletes the matrices since they are not needed by subsequent
 * timesteps; timestep @p n-1 deletes those data vectors which are only needed
 * by one timestep ahead; timestep @p n-2 deletes the remaining vectors and
 * deletes the computational grid, somewhere storing information how to
 * rebuild it eventually.
 *
 * From the given sketch above, it is clear that each time step object sees
 * the following sequence of events:
 * @verbatim
 *   wake up with signal 1
 *   wake up signal 0
 *   do computation
 *   sleep with signal 0
 *   sleep with signal 1
 *   sleep with signal 2
 * @endverbatim
 * This pattern is repeated for each loop in each sweep.
 *
 * For the different loops within each sweep, the numbers of timesteps to look
 * ahead (i.e. the maximum signal number to the @p wake_up function) and the
 * look-behind (i.e. the maximum signal number to the @p sleep function) can
 * be chosen separately. For example, it is usually only needed to look one
 * time step behind when computing error estimation (in some cases, it may
 * vene be possible to not look ahead or back at all, in which case only
 * signals zero will be sent), while one needs a look back of at least one for
 * a timestepping method.
 *
 * Finally, a note on the direction of look-ahead and look-back is in place:
 * look-ahead always refers to the direction the loop is running in, i.e. for
 * loops running forward, @p wake_up is called for timestep objects with a
 * greater time value than the one previously computed on, while @p sleep is
 * called for timesteps with a lower time. If the loop runs in the opposite
 * direction, e.g. when solving a global dual problem, this order is reversed.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 *
 * The main loop of a program using this class will usually look like the
 * following one, taken modified from an application program that isn't
 * distributed as part of the library:
 * @code
 *   template <int dim>
 *   void TimeDependent_Wave<dim>::run_sweep (const unsigned int sweep_no)
 *   {
 *     start_sweep (sweep_no);
 *
 *     solve_primal_problem ();
 *
 *     if (compute_dual_problem)
 *       solve_dual_problem ();
 *
 *     postprocess ();
 *
 *     if (sweep_no != number_of_sweeps-1)
 *       refine_grids ();
 *
 *     write_statistics ();
 *
 *     end_sweep ();
 *   };
 *
 *
 *
 *   template <int dim>
 *   void WaveProblem<dim>::run ()
 *   {
 *     for (unsigned int sweep=0; sweep<number_of_sweeps; ++sweep)
 *       timestep_manager.run_sweep (sweep);
 *   };
 * @endcode
 * Here, @p timestep_manager is an object of type TimeDependent_Wave(), which
 * is a class derived from TimeDependent. @p start_sweep, @p
 * solve_primal_problem, @p solve_dual_problem, @p postprocess and @p
 * end_sweep are functions inherited from this class. They all do a loop over
 * all timesteps within this object and call the respective function on each
 * of these objects. For example, here are two of the functions as they are
 * implemented by the library:
 * @code
 *   void TimeDependent::start_sweep (const unsigned int s)
 *   {
 *     sweep_no = s;
 *
 *                                 // reset the number each
 *                                 // time step has, since some time
 *                                 // steps might have been added since
 *                                 // the last time we visited them
 *                                 //
 *                                 // also set the sweep we will
 *                                 // process in the sequel
 *     for (unsigned int step=0; step<timesteps.size(); ++step)
 *       {
 *         timesteps[step]->set_timestep_no (step);
 *         timesteps[step]->set_sweep_no (sweep_no);
 *       };
 *
 *     for (unsigned int step=0; step<timesteps.size(); ++step)
 *       timesteps[step]->start_sweep ();
 *   };
 *
 *
 *   void
 *   TimeDependent::solve_primal_problem ()
 *   {
 *     do_loop (mem_fun(&TimeStepBase::init_for_primal_problem),
 *              mem_fun(&TimeStepBase::solve_primal_problem),
 *              timestepping_data_primal,
 *              forward);
 *   };
 * @endcode
 * The latter function shows rather clear how most of the loops are invoked
 * (@p solve_primal_problem, @p solve_dual_problem, @p postprocess, @p
 * refine_grids and @p write_statistics all have this form, where the latter
 * two give functions of the derived timestep class, rather than from the base
 * class). The function TimeStepBase::init_for_primal_problem and the
 * respective ones for the other operations defined by that class are only
 * used to store the type of operation which the loop presently performed will
 * do.
 *
 * As can be seen, most of the work is done by the @p do_loop function of this
 * class, which takes the addresses of two functions which are used to
 * initialize all timestep objects for the loop and to actually perform some
 * action. The next parameter gives some information on the look-ahead and
 * look-back and the last one denotes in which direction the loop is to be
 * run.
 *
 * Using function pointers through the @p mem_fun functions provided by the
 * <tt>C++</tt> standard library, it is possible to do neat tricks, like the
 * following, also taken from the wave program, in this case from the function
 * @p refine_grids:
 * @code
 *   ...
 *   compute the thresholds for refinement
 *   ...
 *
 *   do_loop (mem_fun (&TimeStepBase_Tria<dim>::init_for_refinement),
 *            bind2nd (mem_fun1 (&TimeStepBase_Wave<dim>::refine_grid),
 *                     TimeStepBase_Tria<dim>::RefinementData (top_threshold,
 *                                                             bottom_threshold)),
 *            TimeDependent::TimeSteppingData (0,1),
 *            TimeDependent::forward);
 * @endcode
 * TimeStepBase_Wave::refine_grid is a function taking an argument, unlike all
 * the other functions used above within the loops. However, in this special
 * case the parameter was the same for all timesteps and known before the loop
 * was started, so we fixed it and made a function object which to the outside
 * world does not take parameters.
 *
 * Since it is the central function of this class, we finally present a
 * stripped down version of the @p do_loop method, which is shown in order to
 * provide a better understanding of the internals of this class. For brevity
 * we have omitted the parts that deal with backward running loops as well as
 * the checks whether wake-up and sleep operations act on timesteps outside
 * <tt>0..n_timesteps-1</tt>.
 * @code
 *   template <typename InitFunctionObject, typename LoopFunctionObject>
 *   void TimeDependent::do_loop (InitFunctionObject      init_function,
 *                           LoopFunctionObject      loop_function,
 *                           const TimeSteppingData &timestepping_data,
 *                           const Direction         direction)
 *   {
 *                                 // initialize the time steps for
 *                                 // a round of this loop
 *     for (unsigned int step=0; step<n_timesteps; ++step)
 *       init_function (static_cast<typename InitFunctionObject::argument_type>
 *                 (timesteps[step]));
 *
 *                                 // wake up the first few time levels
 *     for (int step=-timestepping_data.look_ahead; step<0; ++step)

 *                                     // first thing: wake up the
 *                                     // timesteps ahead as necessary

  /**
   * This structure is used to tell the TimeStepBase_Tria() class how grids
   * should be refined. Before we explain all the different variables, fist
   * some terminology:
   * <ul>
   * <li> Correction: after having flagged some cells of the triangulation for
   * following some given criterion, we may want to change the number of
   * flagged cells on this grid according to another criterion that the number
   * of cells may be only a certain fraction more or less then the number of
   * cells on the previous grid. This change of refinement flags will be
   * called "correction" in the sequel.
   * <li> Adaption: in order to make the change between one grid and the next
   * not to large, we may want to flag some additional cells on one of the two
   * grids such that there are not too grave differences. This process will be
   * called "adaption".
   * </ul>
   *
   *
   * <h3>Description of flags</h3>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li> @p max_refinement_level: Cut the refinement of cells at a given
   * level. This flag does not influence the flagging of cells, so not more
   * cells on the coarser levels are flagged than usual. Rather, the flags are
   * all set, but when it comes to the actual refinement, the maximum
   * refinement level is truncated.
   *
   * This option is only really useful when you want to compare global
   * refinement with adaptive refinement when you don't want the latter to
   * refine more than the global refinement.
   *
   * <li> @p first_sweep_with_correction: When using cell number correction as
   * defined above, it may be worth while to start with this only in later
   * sweeps, not already in the first one. If this variable is zero, then
   * start with the first sweep, else with a higher one. The rationale for
   * only starting later is that we do not want to block the development of
   * grids at the beginning and only impose restrictions in the sweeps where
   * we start to be interested in the actual results of the computations.
   *
   * <li> @p min_cells_for_correction: If we want a more free process of grid
   * development, we may want to impose less rules for grids with few cells
   * also. This variable sets a lower bound for the cell number of grids where
   * corrections are to be performed.
   *
   * <li> @p cell_number_corridor_top: Fraction of the number of cells by
   * which the number of cells of one grid may be higher than that on the
   * previous grid. Common values are 10 per cent (i.e. 0.1). The naming of
   * the variable results from the goal to define a target corridor for the
   * number of cells after refinement has taken place.
   *
   * <li> @p cell_number_corridor_bottom: Fraction of the number of cells by
   * which the number of cells of one grid may be lower than that on the
   * previous grid. Common values are 5 per cent (i.e. 0.05). Usually this
   * number will be smaller than @p cell_number_corridor_top since an increase
   * of the number of cells is not harmful (though it increases the numerical
   * amount of work needed to solve the problem) while a sharp decrease may
   * reduce the accuracy of the final result even if the time steps computed
   * before the decrease were computed to high accuracy.
   *
   * Note however, that if you compute the dual problem as well, then the time
   * direction is reversed, so the two values defining the cell number
   * corridor should be about equal.
   *
   * <li> @p correction_relaxations: This is a list of pairs of number with
   * the following meaning: just as for @p min_cells_for_correction, it may be
   * worth while to reduce the requirements upon grids if the have few cells.
   * The present variable stores a list of cell numbers along with some values
   * which tell us that the cell number corridor should be enlarged by a
   * certain factor. For example, if this list was <tt>((100 5) (200 3) (500
   * 2))</tt>, this would mean that for grids with a cell number below 100,
   * the <tt>cell_number_corridor_*</tt> variables are to be multiplied by 5
   * before they are applied, for cell numbers below 200 they are to be
   * multiplied by 3, and so on.
   *
   * @p correction_relaxations is actually a vector of such list. Each entry
   * in this vector denotes the relaxation rules for one sweep. The last entry
   * defines the relaxation rules for all following sweeps. This scheme is
   * adopted to allow for stricter corrections in later sweeps while the
   * relaxations may be more generous in the first sweeps.
   *
   * There is a static variable @p default_correction_relaxations which you
   * can use as a default value. It is an empty list and thus defines no
   * relaxations.
   *
   * <li> @p cell_number_correction_steps: Usually, if you want the number of
   * cells to be corrected, the target corridor for the cell number is
   * computed and some additional cells are flagged or flags are removed. But
   * since the cell number resulting after flagging and deflagging can not be
   * easily computed, it will usually not be within the corridor. We therefore
   * need to iteratively get to our goal. Usually, three or four iterations
   * are needed, but using this variable, you can reduce the allowed number of
   * iterations; breaking the loop after two iterations yields good results
   * regularly. Setting the variable to zero will result in no correction
   * steps at all.
   *
   * <li> @p mirror_flags_to_previous_grid: If a cell on the present grid is
   * flagged for refinement, also flag the corresponding cell on the previous
   * grid. This is useful if, for example, error indicators are computed for
   * space-time cells, but are stored for the second grid only. Now, since the
   * first grid has the same contributions to the indicators as the second, it
   * may be useful to flag both if necessary. This is done if the present
   * variable is set.
   *
   * <li> @p adapt_grids: adapt the present grid to the previous one in the
   * sense defined above. What is actually done here is the following: if
   * going from the previous to the present grid would result in double
   * refinement or double coarsening of some cells, then we try to flag these
   * cells for refinement or coarsening such as to avoid the double step.
   * Obviously, more than double refinement of coarsening is also caught.
   *
   * Grid adaption can try to avoid such changes between two grids, but it can
   * never promise that they don't occur. This is because the next grid may
   * change the present one, but then again there may be jumps in refinement
   * level between the present and the previous one; this could only be
   * avoided by looping iteratively through all grids, back and forth, until
   * nothing changes anymore, which is obviously impossible if there are many
   * time steps with very large grids.

/**
 * Specialisation of TimeStepBase which addresses some aspects of grid
 * handling. In particular, this class is thought to make handling of grids
 * available that are adaptively refined on each time step separately or with
 * a loose coupling between time steps. It also takes care of deleting and
 * rebuilding grids when memory resources are a point, through the @p sleep
 * and @p wake_up functions declared in the base class.
 *
 * In addition to that, it offers functions which do some rather hairy
 * refinement rules for time dependent problems, trying to avoid too much
 * change in the grids between subsequent time levels, while also trying to
 * retain the freedom of refining each grid separately. There are lots of
 * flags and numbers controlling this function, which might drastically change
 * the behaviour of the function -- see the description of the flags for
 * further information.
