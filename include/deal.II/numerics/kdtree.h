/**
 * A wrapper for the nanoflann library, used to compute the distance from a
 * collection of points, and to efficiently return nearest neighbors to a
 * target point. This class uses nanoflann to efficiently partition the
 * space in a $k$-dimensional tree. The cost of each query is then roughly of
 * order $\log(n)$, where $n$ is the number of points stored in this class.
 *
 * The wrapper provides methods that give access to some of the functionalities
 * of the nanoflann library, like searching the $p$ nearest neighbors of
 * a given point, or
 * searching the points that fall within a radius of a target point.
 *
 * > From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree):
 * >
 * > A k-d tree is a binary tree in which every node is a $k$-dimensional point.
 * > Every non-leaf node can be thought of as implicitly generating a splitting
 * > hyperplane that divides the space into two parts, known as half-spaces.
 * > Points to the left of this hyperplane are represented by the left subtree of
 * > that node and points right of the hyperplane are represented by the right
 * > subtree. The hyperplane direction is chosen in the following way: every node
 * > in the tree is associated with one of the $k$-dimensions, with the hyperplane
 * > perpendicular to that dimension's axis. So, for example, if for a particular
 * > split the "x" axis is chosen, all points in the subtree with a smaller "x"
 * > value than the node will appear in the left subtree and all points with
 * > larger "x" value will be in the right subtree. In such a case, the
 * > hyperplane would be set by the $x$-value of the point, and its normal would be
 * > the unit $x$-axis.

   * @param[in] pts A vector of points that are to be represented by

   * the vector you pass is longer than the life of this class, or
   * you will get undefined behaviour.
   *
   * @warning If you change the contents of the vector of points that you
   * passed either to the constructor or to set_points(), remember to call
   * the set_points() method again. The tree and the index are
   * constructed only once when you pass the points (either at
