/**
 * Print intermediate solutions in solvers.  This is derived from a solver
 * class provided as template argument.  It implements the @p print_vector
 * function of the solver using a DoFHandler. This way, the intermediate
 * vectors can be viewed as finite element functions. This class might be used
 * first to understand how solvers work (for example to visualize the
 * smoothing properties of various solvers, e.g. in a multigrid context), and
 * second to investigate why and how a solver fails to solve certain classes
 * of problems.
 *
 * Objects of this class are provided with a solver class through a template
 * argument, and with a file name (as a string), with which a new file is
 * constructed in each iteration (named <tt>basename.[step].[suffix]</tt>) and
 * into which the solution is written as a finite element field using the
 * DataOut class. Please note that this class may produce enormous amounts of
 * data!
