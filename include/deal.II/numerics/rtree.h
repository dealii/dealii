/**
 * A wrapper for the boost::geometry::index::rtree class, implementing a
 * self-balancing spatial index (the R-tree) capable of storing various types of
 * values, using different balancing algorithms.
 *
 * From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree):
 * <blockquote>
 * R-trees are tree data structures used for spatial access methods, i.e., for
 * indexing multi-dimensional information such as geographical coordinates,
 * rectangles or polygons. The R-tree was proposed by Antonin Guttman in 1984
 * and has found significant use in both theoretical and applied contexts. A
 * common real-world usage for an R-tree might be to store spatial objects such
 * as restaurant locations or the polygons that typical maps are made of:
 * streets, buildings, outlines of lakes, coastlines, etc. and then find answers
 * quickly to queries such as "Find all museums within 2 km of my current
 * location", "retrieve all road segments within 2 km of my location" (to
 * display them in a navigation system) or "find the nearest gas station"
 * (although not taking roads into account). The R-tree can also accelerate
 * nearest neighbor search for various distance metrics, including
 * great-circle distance.
 *
 * The key idea of the data structure is to group nearby objects and represent
 * them with their minimum bounding rectangle in the next higher level of the
 * tree; the "R" in R-tree is for rectangle. Since all objects lie within this
 * bounding rectangle, a query that does not intersect the bounding rectangle
 * also cannot intersect any of the contained objects. At the leaf level, each
 * rectangle describes a single object; at higher levels the aggregation of an
 * increasing number of objects. This can also be seen as an increasingly coarse
 * approximation of the data set.
 *
 * The key difficulty of R-tree is to build an efficient tree that on one hand
 * is balanced (so the leaf nodes are at the same height) on the other hand the
 * rectangles do not cover too much empty space and do not overlap too much (so
 * that during search, fewer subtrees need to be processed). For example, the
 * original idea for inserting elements to obtain an efficient tree is to always
 * insert into the subtree that requires least enlargement of its bounding box.
 * Once that page is full, the data is split into two sets that should cover the
 * minimal area each. Most of the research and improvements for R-trees aims at
 * improving the way the tree is built and can be grouped into two objectives:
 * building an efficient tree from scratch (known as bulk-loading) and
 * performing changes on an existing tree (insertion and deletion).
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * An RTree may store any type of @p LeafType as long as it is possible to extract
 * an @p Indexable that the RTree can handle and compare values. An @p Indexable
 * is a type adapted to the Point, BoundingBox or Segment concept, for which
 * distance and equality comparison are implemented. The deal.II Point, Segment,
 * and BoundingBox classes satisfy this requirement, but you can mix in any
 * geometry object that boost::geometry accepts as indexable.
 *
 * In particular, given an @p Indexable type (for example a Point,  a BoundingBox,
 * or a Segment), @p LeafType can by any of @p Indexable, `std::pair<Indexable, T>`,
 * `boost::tuple<Indexable, ...>` or `std::tuple<Indexable, ...>`.
 *
 * The optional argument @p IndexType is used only when adding elements to the
 * tree one by one. If a range insertion is used, then the tree is built using
 * the packing algorithm.
 *
 * Linear, quadratic, and rstar algorithms are available if one wants to
 * construct the tree sequentially. However, none of these is very efficient,
 * and users should use the packing algorithm when possible.
 *
 * The packing algorithm constructs the tree all at once, and may be used when
 * you have all the leaves at your disposal.
 *
 * This class is usually used in combination with one of the two helper
 * functions pack_rtree(), that takes a container or a range of iterators to
 * construct the RTree using the packing algorithm.
 *
 * An example usage is the following:
 *
 * @code
 * std::vector<Point<2>> points = generate_some_points();
 * auto tree = pack_rtree(points.begin(), points.end());
 * // or, equivalently:
 * // auto tree = pack_rtree(points);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The tree is accessed by using [`boost::geometry::index`
 * queries](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/geometry/spatial_indexes/queries.html).
 * For example, after constructing the tree with the snippet above, one can ask
 * for the closest points to a segment in the following way:
 *
 * @code
 * namespace bgi = boost::geometry::index;
 *
 * Segment<2> segment(Point<2>(0,0), Point<2>(1,1));
 *
 * std::vector<Point<2>> nearest;
 * tree.query(bgi::nearest(segment,3), std::back_inserter(intersection));
 * // Returns the 3 closest points to the Segment defined above.
 * @endcode
 *
 * In general, a tree does not need to store the actual objects, as long as it
 * knows how to access a const reference to an indexable type. This is
 * achieved by passing the optional template argument @p IndexableGetter, that
 * extracts a const reference to one of the possible indexable types given an
 * object of type @p LeafType. As an example, one may store points in a container,
 * and only create a tree of the indices within the container, using the
 * IndexableGetterFromIndices class defined below, and the function
 * pack_rtree_of_indices().

/**
 * Given a RTree object @p rtree, and a target level @p level, return a vector
 * of BoundingBox objects containing all the bounding boxes that make the given
 * @p level of the @p rtree. This function is a convenient wrapper around the
 * ExtractLevelVisitor class. It is used in step-70.
 *
 * Since an RTree object is a balanced tree, you can expect each entry of the
 * resulting vector to contain roughly the same number of children, and
 * ultimately, the same number of leaf objects. If you request for a level that
 * is not present in the RTree, the last level is returned.
 *
 * A typical usage of this function is in the context of
 * parallel::distributed::Triangulation objects, where one would like to
 * construct a rough representation of the area which is covered by the locally
 * owned cells of the active process, and exchange this information with other
 * processes. The finest level of information is given by the leaves, which in
 * this context would be the collection of all the bounding boxes associated
 * to the locally owned cells of the triangulation. Exchanging this information
 * with all participating processess would defeat the purpuse of parallel
 * computations. If however one constructs an RTree containing these bounding
 * boxes (for example, by calling
 * GridTools::Cache::get_cell_bounding_boxes_rtree()), and then extracts one of
 * the first levels of the RTree, only a handful of BoundingBox objects would be
 * returned, allowing the user to have a very efficient description of the
 * geometry of the domain, and of its distribution among processes.
 *
 * An example usage is given by the following snippet of code:
 * @code
 * parallel::distributed::Triangulation<2> tria(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
 * GridGenerator::hyper_ball(tria);
 * tria.refine_global(4);
 *
 * std::vector<BoundingBox<2>> all_boxes(tria.n_locally_owned_active_cells());
 * unsigned int                i = 0;
 * for (const auto &cell : tria.active_cell_iterators())
 *   if (cell->is_locally_owned())
 *     all_boxes[i++] = cell->bounding_box();
 *
 * const auto tree  = pack_rtree(all_boxes);
 * const auto boxes = extract_rtree_level(tree, 1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * When run on three processes, the complete set of the BoundingBox objects
 * surrounding only the locally owned cells and the second level of the rtree
 * constructed with those boxes would look like in the following pictures (one
 * image per process):
 *
 * @image html rtree-process-0.png
 * @image html rtree-process-1.png
 * @image html rtree-process-2.png
