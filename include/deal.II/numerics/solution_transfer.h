/**
 * This class implements the transfer of a discrete FE function (e.g. a
 * solution vector) from one mesh to another that is obtained from the first
 * by a single refinement and/or coarsening step. During interpolation the
 * vector is reinitialized to the new size and filled with the interpolated
 * values. This class is used in the step-15, step-31, and step-33 tutorial
 * programs. A version of this class that works on parallel triangulations is
 * available as parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * This class implements the algorithms in two different ways:
 * <ul>
 * <li> If the grid will only be refined (i.e. no cells are coarsened) then
 * use @p SolutionTransfer as follows:
 * @code
 * SolutionTransfer<dim, double> soltrans(*dof_handler);
 *                                     // flag some cells for refinement, e.g.
 * GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction(
 *   *tria, error_indicators, 0.3, 0);
 *                                     // prepare the triangulation
 *                                     // for refinement,
 * tria->prepare_coarsening_and_refinement();
 *                                     // tell the SolutionTransfer object
 *                                     // that we intend to do pure refinement,
 * soltrans.prepare_for_pure_refinement();
 *                                     // actually execute the refinement,
 * tria->execute_coarsening_and_refinement();
 *                                     // and redistribute dofs.
 * dof_handler->distribute_dofs (fe);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Then to proceed do
 * @code
 *                                     // take a copy of the solution vector
 * Vector<double> solution_old(solution);
 *                                     // resize solution vector to the correct
 *                                     // size, as the @p refine_interpolate
 *                                     // function requires the vectors to be
 *                                     // of right sizes
 * solution.reinit(dof_handler->n_dofs());
 *                                     // and finally interpolate
 * soltrans.refine_interpolate(solution_old, solution);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Although the @p refine_interpolate functions are allowed to be called
 * multiple times, e.g. for interpolating several solution vectors, there is
 * following possibility of interpolating several functions simultaneously.
 * @code
 * vector<Vector<double> > solutions_old(n_vectors, Vector<double> (n));
 * ...
 * vector<Vector<double> > solutions(n_vectors, Vector<double> (n));
 * soltrans.refine_interpolate(solutions_old, solutions);
 * @endcode
 * This is used in several of the tutorial programs, for example step-31.
 *
 * <li> If the grid has cells that will be coarsened, then use @p
 * SolutionTransfer as follows:
 * @code
 * SolutionTransfer<dim, Vector<double> > soltrans(*dof_handler);
 *                                     // flag some cells for refinement
 *                                     // and coarsening, e.g.
 * GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction(
 *   *tria, error_indicators, 0.3, 0.05);
 *                                     // prepare the triangulation,
 * tria->prepare_coarsening_and_refinement();
 *                                     // prepare the SolutionTransfer object
 *                                     // for coarsening and refinement and give
 *                                     // the solution vector that we intend to
 *                                     // interpolate later,
 * soltrans.prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(solution);
 *                                     // actually execute the refinement,
 * tria->execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
 *                                     // redistribute dofs,
 * dof_handler->distribute_dofs (fe);
 *                                     // and interpolate the solution
 * Vector<double> interpolate_solution(dof_handler->n_dofs());
 * soltrans.interpolate(solution, interpolated_solution);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Multiple calls to the function <tt>interpolate (const Vector<number> &in,
 * Vector<number> &out)</tt> are NOT allowed. Interpolating several functions
 * can be performed in one step by using <tt>void interpolate (const
 * vector<Vector<number> >&all_in, vector<Vector<number> >&all_out)
 * const</tt>, and using the respective @p
 * prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement function taking several vectors as
 * input before actually refining and coarsening the triangulation (see
 * there).
 * </ul>
 *
 * For deleting all stored data in @p SolutionTransfer and reinitializing it
 * use the <tt>clear()</tt> function.
 *
 * The template argument @p number denotes the data type of the vectors you
 * want to transfer.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Solution transfer with only refinement. Assume that we have got a
 * solution vector on the current (original) grid. Each entry of this vector
 * belongs to one of the DoFs of the discretization. If we now refine the grid
 * then the calling of DoFHandler::distribute_dofs() will change at least some
 * of the DoF indices. Hence we need to store the DoF indices of all active
 * cells before the refinement. A pointer for each active cell is used to
 * point to the vector of these DoF indices of that cell. This is done by
 * prepare_for_pure_refinement().
 *
 * In the function <tt>refine_interpolate(in,out)</tt> and on each cell where
 * the pointer is set (i.e. the cells that were active in the original grid)
 * we can now access the local values of the solution vector @p in on that
 * cell by using the stored DoF indices. These local values are interpolated
 * and set into the vector @p out that is at the end the discrete function @p
 * in interpolated on the refined mesh.
 *
 * The <tt>refine_interpolate(in,out)</tt> function can be called multiple
 * times for arbitrary many discrete functions (solution vectors) on the
 * original grid.
 *
 * <li> Solution transfer with coarsening and refinement. After calling
 * Triangulation::prepare_coarsening_and_refinement the coarsen flags of
 * either all or none of the children of a (father-)cell are set. While
 * coarsening (Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement) the cells
 * that are not needed any more will be deleted from the Triangulation.
 *
 * For the interpolation from the (to be coarsenend) children to their father
 * the children cells are needed. Hence this interpolation and the storing of
 * the interpolated values of each of the discrete functions that we want to
 * interpolate needs to take place before these children cells are coarsened
 * (and deleted!!). Again a pointers for the relevant cells is set to point to
 * these values (see below). Additionally the DoF indices of the cells that
 * will not be coarsened need to be stored according to the solution transfer
 * while pure refinement (cf there). All this is performed by
 * <tt>prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(all_in)</tt> where the
 * <tt>vector<Vector<number> >vector all_in</tt> includes all discrete
 * functions to be interpolated onto the new grid.
 *
 * As we need two different kinds of pointers (<tt>vector<unsigned int> *</tt>
 * for the Dof indices and <tt>vector<Vector<number> > *</tt> for the
 * interpolated DoF values) we use the @p Pointerstruct that includes both of
 * these pointers and the pointer for each cell points to these @p
 * Pointerstructs. On each cell only one of the two different pointers is used
 * at one time hence we could use a <tt>void * pointer</tt> as
 * <tt>vector<unsigned int> *</tt> at one time and as
 * <tt>vector<Vector<number> > *</tt> at the other but using this @p
 * Pointerstruct in between makes the use of these pointers more safe and
 * gives better possibility to expand their usage.
 *
 * In <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> the refined cells are treated
 * according to the solution transfer while pure refinement. Additionally, on
 * each cell that is coarsened (hence previously was a father cell), the
 * values of the discrete functions in @p all_out are set to the stored local
 * interpolated values that are accessible due to the 'vector<Vector<number> >
 * *' pointer in @p Pointerstruct that is pointed to by the pointer of that
 * cell. It is clear that <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> only can be
 * called with the <tt>vector<Vector<number> > all_in</tt> that previously was
 * the parameter of the <tt>prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(all_in)</tt>
 * function. Hence <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> can (in contrast to
 * <tt>refine_interpolate(in, out)</tt>) only be called once.
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Interaction with hanging nodes</h3>
 *
 * This class does its best to represent on the new mesh the finite element
 * function that existed on the old mesh, but this may lead to situations
 * where the function on the new mesh is no longer conforming at hanging
 * nodes. To this end, consider a situation of a twice refined mesh that
 * started with a single square cell (i.e., we now have 16 cells). Consider
 * also that we coarsen 4 of the cells back to the first refinement level. In
 * this case, we end up with a mesh that will look as follows if we were to
 * use a $Q_1$ element:
 *
 * @image html hanging_nodes.png ""
 *
 * The process of interpolating from the old to the new mesh would imply that
 * the values of the finite element function will not change on all of the
 * cells that remained as they are (i.e., the fine cells) but that on the
 * coarse cell at the top right, the four values at the vertices are obtained
 * by interpolating down from its former children.  If the original function
 * was not linear, this implies that the marked hanging nodes will retain
 * their old values which, in general, will not lead to a continuous function
 * along the corresponding edges. In other words, the solution vector obtained
 * after SolutionTransfer::interpolate() does not satisfy hanging node
 * constraints: it corresponds to the pointwise interpolation, but not to the
 * interpolation <i>onto the new finite element space that contains
 * constraints from hanging nodes</i>.
 *
 * Whether this is a problem you need to worry about or not depends on your
 * application. The situation is easily corrected, of course, by applying
 * ConstraintMatrix::distribute() to your solution vector after transfer,
 * using a constraint matrix object computed on the new DoFHandler object (you
 * probably need to create this object anyway if you have hanging nodes). This
 * is also what is done, for example, in step-15.
 *
 * @note This situation can only happen if you do coarsening. If all cells
 * remain as they are or are refined, then SolutionTransfer::interpolate()
 * computes a new vector of nodel values, but the function represented is of
 * course exactly the same because the old finite element space is a subspace
 * of the new one. Thus, if the old function was conforming (i.e., satisfied
 * hanging node constraints), then so does the new one, and it is not
 * necessary to call ConstraintMatrix::distribute().
 *
 *
 * <h3>Implementation in the context of hp finite elements</h3>
 *
 * In the case of hp::DoFHandlers, nothing defines which of the finite
 * elements that are part of the hp::FECollection associated with the DoF
 * handler, should be considered on cells that are not active (i.e., that have
 * children). This is because degrees of freedom are only allocated for active
 * cells and, in fact, it is not allowed to set an active_fe_index on non-
 * active cells using DoFAccessor::set_active_fe_index().
 *
 * It is, thus, not entirely natural what should happen if, for example, a few
 * cells are coarsened away. This class then implements the following
 * algorithm: - If a cell is refined, then the values of the solution
 * vector(s) are saved before refinement on the to-be-refined cell and in the
 * space associated with this cell. These values are then interpolated to the
 * finite element spaces of the children post-refinement. This may lose
 * information if, for example, the old cell used a Q2 space and the children
 * use Q1 spaces, or the information may be prolonged if the mother cell used
 * a Q1 space and the children are Q2s. - If cells are to be coarsened, then
 * the values from the child cells are interpolated to the mother cell using
 * the largest of the child cell spaces. For example, if the children of a
 * cell use Q1, Q2 and Q3 spaces, then the values from the children are
 * interpolated into a Q3 space on the mother cell. After refinement, this Q3
 * function on the mother cell is then interpolated into the space the user
 * has selected for this cell (which may be different from Q3, in this
 * example, if the user has set the active_fe_index for a different space
 * post-refinement and before calling hp::DoFHandler::distribute_dofs()).
 *
 * @note In the context of hp refinement, if cells are coarsened or the
 * polynomial degree is lowered on some cells, then the old finite element
 * space is not a subspace of the new space and you may run into the same
 * situation as discussed above with hanging nodes. You may want to consider
 * calling ConstraintMatrix::distribute() on the vector obtained by
 * transfering the solution.
