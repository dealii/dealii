   * This function is a kind of generalization or modification of the very
   * first interpolate() function in the series. It interpolates a set of
   * functions onto the finite element space defined by the DoFHandler argument,
   * where the determination which function to use on each cell is made
   * based on the material id (see
   * @ref GlossMaterialId)
   * of each cell.
   *
   * @param[in] mapping        The mapping to use to determine the location of
   *   support points at which the functions are to be evaluated.
   * @param[in] dof_handler    DoFHandler initialized with Triangulation and
   *   FiniteElement objects and that defines the finite element space.
   * @param[in] function_map   A std::map reflecting the correspondence between
   *   material ids on those cells on which something should be interpolated,
   *   and the functions to be interpolated onto the finite element space.
   * @param[out] dst           The global finie element vector holding the
   *   output of the interpolated values.
   * @param[in] component_mask A mask of components that shall be interpolated.
   *
   * @note If the algorithm encounters a cell whose material id is not listed
   * in the given @p function_map, then @p dst will not be updated in the
   * respective degrees of freedom of the output vector. For example, if
   * @p dst was initialized to zero, then those zeros which correspond to
   * the missed material ids will still remain in @p dst after calling
   * this function.
   *
   * @note Degrees of freedom located on faces between cells of different
   * material ids will get their value by that cell which was called last in
   * the respective loop over cells implemented in this function. Since the
   * order of cells is somewhat arbitrary, you cannot control it. However, if
   * you want to have control over the order in which cells are visited, let us
   * take a
   * look at the following example: Let @p u be a variable of interest which
   * is approximated by some CG finite element. Let @p 0, @p 1 and @p 2 be
   * material ids of cells on the triangulation. Let 0: 0.0, 1: 1.0, 2: 2.0 be
   * the whole @p function_map that you want to pass to this function, where
   * @p key is a material id and @p value is a value of @p u. By using the
   * whole @p function_map you do not really know which values will be
   * assigned to the face DoFs. On the other hand, if you split the whole @p
   * function_map into three smaller independent objects 0: 0.0 and 1: 1.0 and
   * 2: 2.0 and make three distinct calls of this function passing each of
   * these objects separately (the order depends on what you want to get
   * between cells), then each subsequent call will rewrite the intercell @p
   * dofs of the previous one.
