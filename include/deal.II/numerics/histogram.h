/**
 * This class provides some facilities to generate 2d and 3d histograms. It is
 * used by giving it one or several data sets and a rule how to break the
 * range of values therein into intervals (e.g. linear spacing or logarithmic
 * spacing of intervals). The values are then sorted into the different
 * intervals and the number of values in each interval is stored for output
 * later. In case only one data set was given, the resulting histogram will be
 * a 2d one, while it will be a 3d one if more than one data set was given.
 * For more than one data set, the same intervals are used for each of them
 * anyway, to make comparison easier.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Ways to generate the intervals</h3>
 *
 * At present, the following schemes for interval spacing are implemented:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Linear spacing: The intervals are distributed in constant steps
 * between the minimum and maximum values of the data.
 * <li> Logaritmic spacing: The intervals are distributed in constant steps
 * between the minimum and maximum values of the logs of the values. This
 * scheme is only useful if the data has only positive values. Negative and
 * zero values are sorted into the leftmost interval.
 * </ul>
 *
 * To keep programs extendible, you can use the two functions @p
 * get_interval_spacing_names and @p parse_interval_spacing, which always give
 * you a complete list of spacing formats presently supported and are able to
 * generate the respective value of the @p enum. If you use them, you can
 * write your program in a way such that it only needs to be recompiled to
 * take effect of newly added formats, without changing your code.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Output formats</h3>
 *
 * At present, only GNUPLOT output is supported.

  /**
   * Take several lists of values, each on to produce one histogram that will
   * then be arrange one behind each other.
   *
   * Using several data sets at once allows to compare them more easily, since
   * the intervals into which the data is sorted is the same for all data
   * sets.
   *
   * The histograms will be arranged such that the computed intervals of the
   * <tt>values[i][j]</tt> form the x-range, and the number of values in each
   * interval will be the y-range (for 2d plots) or the z-range (for 3d
   * plots). For 3d plots, the @p y_values parameter is used to assign each
   * data set a value in the y direction, which is the depth coordinate in the
   * resulting plot. For 2d plots, the @p y_values are ignored.
   *
   * If you give only one data set, i.e. <tt>values.size()==1</tt>, then the
   * resulting histogram will be a 2d one.
   *
   * @p n_intervals denotes the number of intervals into which the data will
   * be sorted; @p interval_spacing denotes the way the bounds of the
   * intervals are computed. Refer to the general documentation for more
   * information on this.
