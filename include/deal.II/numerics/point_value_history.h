/**
 * PointValueHistory tackles the overhead of plotting time (or any other
 * iterative process) graphs of solution values at specific points on the
 * mesh. The user specifies the points which the solution should be monitored
 * at ahead of time, as well as giving each solution vector that they want to
 * record a mnemonic name. Then, for each step the user calls one of the three
 * available "evaluate field" methods to store the data from each time step,
 * and the class extracts data for the requested points to store it. Finally,
 * once the computation is finished, the user can request output files to be
 * generated; these files are in Gnuplot format but are basically just regular
 * text and can easily be imported into other programs well, for example into
 * spreadsheets.
 *
 * The user can store extra variables which do not relate to mesh location
 * specifying n_independent_variables. The class then expects a std::vector of
 * size n_independent_variables to be added during each step using the method
 * @p push_back_independent. This may be used for example for recording
 * external input, logging solver performance data such as time taken to solve
 * the step and solver steps before convergence, saving norms calculated, or
 * simply saving the time, number of time step, or number of nonlinear
 * iteration along with the data evaluated from the mesh.
 *
 * The three "evaluate field" methods each have different strengths and
 * weaknesses making each suitable for different contexts:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Firstly, the @p evaluate_field version that does not take a @p
 * DataPostprocessor object selects the nearest support point (see
 * @ref GlossSupport "this entry in the glossary"
 * ) to a given point to extract data from. This makes the code that needs to
 * be run at each time step very short, since looping over the mesh to extract
 * the needed dof_index can be done just once at the start. However, this
 * method is not suitable for FiniteElement objects that do not assign dofs to
 * actual mesh locations (i.e. FEs without
 * @ref GlossSupport "support points"
 * ) or if adaptive mesh refinement is used. The reason for the latter
 * restriction is that the location of the closest support point to a given
 * point may change upon mesh refinement. The class will throw an exception if
 * any change to the triangulation is made (Although the nearest support point
 * could be re- computed upon mesh refinement, the location of the support
 * point will most likely change slightly, making the interpretation of the
 * data difficult, hence this is not implemented currently.)
 *
 * <li> Secondly, @p evaluate_field_at_requested_location calls @p
 * VectorTools::point_value to compute values at the specific point requested.
 * This method is valid for any FE that is supported by @p
 * VectorTools::point_value. Specifically, this method can be called by codes
 * using adaptive mesh refinement.
 *
 * <li>Finally, the class offers a function @p evaluate_field that takes a @p
 * DataPostprocessor object. This method allows the deal.II data postprocessor
 * to be used to compute new quantities from the solution on the fly. The
 * values are located at the nearest quadrature point to the requested point.
 * If the mesh is refined between calls, this point will change, so care must
 * be taken when using this method in code using adaptive refinement, but as
 * the output will be meaningful (in the sense that the quadrature point
 * selected is guaranteed to remain in the same vicinity, the class does not
 * prevent the use of this method in adaptive codes. The class provides
 * warnings in the output files if the mesh has changed. Note that one can
 * reduce the error this procedure introduces by providing a quadrature
 * formula that has more points, at the expense of performing more work since
 * then the closest quadrature points is nearer to the point at which the
 * evaluation is really supposed to happen. (As a sidenote: Why not do the
 * evaluation at the requested point right away? The reason for this is that
 * it would require setting up a new quadrature point object on each cell that
 * has only a single point corresponding to the reference coordinates of the
 * point you really want; then initializing a FEValues object with it; then
 * evaluating the solution at this point; then handing the result to the
 * DataPostprocessor object. This sequence of things is expensive -- which is
 * the reason why VectorTools::point_value() is expensive. Using the same
 * quadrature formula on each cell on which we want to evaluate the solution
 * and only having to initialize a FEValue object once is a much cheaper
 * alternative, albeit of course at the expense of getting only an approximate
 * result.)
 * </ol>
 *
 * When recording a new mnemonic name, the user must supply a component_mask
 * (see
 * @ref GlossComponentMask "this glossary entry"
 * ) to indicate the
 * @ref GlossComponent "(vector) components"
 * to be extracted from the given input. If the user simply wants to extract
 * all the components, the mask need not be explicitly supplied to the @p
 * add_field_name method and the default value of the parameter is sufficient.
 * If the @p evaluate_field with a @p DataPostprocessor object is used, the
 * component_mask is interpreted as the mask of the @p DataPostprocessor
 * return vector. The size of this mask can be different to that of the FE
 * space, but must be provided when the @p add_field_name method is called.
 * One variant of the @p add_field_name method allows an unsigned int input to
 * construct a suitable mask, if all values from the @p DataPostprocessor are
 * desired.
 *
 * The class automatically generates names for the data stored based on the
 * mnemonics supplied. The methods @p add_component_names and @p
 * add_independent_names allow the user to provide lists of names to use
 * instead if desired.
 *
 * Following is a little code snippet that shows a common usage of this class:
 *
 * @code
 * #include <deal.II/numerics/point_value_history.h>
 * //....
 *
 * //... code to setup Triangulation, perform any refinement necessary
 * // and setup DoFHandler, sizing solution Vectors etc
 *
 * // call the constructor
 * unsigned int n_inputs = 1; // just one independent value, which happens to be an input
 * PointValueHistory<dim> node_monitor(dof_handler, n_inputs);
 *
 * // setup fields and points required
 * node_monitor.add_field_name("Solution");
 * std::vector <Point <dim> > point_vector(2);
 * point_vector[0] = Point <dim>(0, 0);
 * point_vector[1] = Point <dim>(0.25, 0);
 * node_monitor.add_points(point_vector); // multiple points at once
 * node_monitor.add_point(Point<dim>(1, 0.2)); // add a single point
 * node_monitor.close(); // close the class once the setup is complete
 * node_monitor.status(std::cout); // print out status to check if desired
 *
 * // ... more code ...
 *
 * // ... in an iterative loop ...
 * // double time, vector <double> with size 1 input_value,
 * // and Vector <double> solution calculated in the loop
 * node_monitor.start_new_dataset(time);
 * node_monitor.push_back_independent(input_value);
 * node_monitor.evaluate_field("Solution", solution);
 *
 * // ... end of iterative loop ...
 *
 * node_monitor.write_gnuplot("node"); // write out data files
