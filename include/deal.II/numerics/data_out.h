/**
 * This class is the main class to provide output of data described by finite
 * element fields defined on a collection of cells.
 *
 * This class is an actual implementation of the functionality proposed by the
 * DataOut_DoFData class. It offers a function build_patches() that generates
 * the data to be written in some graphics format. Most of the interface and
 * an example of its use is described in the documentation of this base class.
 *
 * The only thing this class offers is the function build_patches() which
 * loops over all cells of the triangulation stored by the
 * attach_dof_handler() function of the base class (with the exception of
 * cells of parallel::distributed::Triangulation objects that are not owned by
 * the current processor) and converts the data on these to actual patches
 * which are the objects that are later output by the functions of the base
 * classes. You can give a parameter to the function which determines how many
 * subdivisions in each coordinate direction are to be performed, i.e. of how
 * many subcells each patch shall consist. The default is one, but you may want
 * to choose a higher number for higher order elements, for example two for
 * quadratic elements, three for cubic elements, and so on. (See
 * step-11 for an example.) The purpose
 * of this parameter is because most graphics programs do not allow to specify
 * higher order polynomial functions in the file formats: only data at
 * vertices can be plotted and is then shown as a bilinear interpolation
 * within the interior of cells. This may be insufficient if you have higher
 * order finite elements, and the only way to achieve better output is to
 * subdivide each cell of the mesh into several cells for graphical output. Of
 * course, what you get to see is still a bilinear interpolation on each cell
 * of the output (where these cells are not subdivisions of the cells of the
 * triangulation in use) due to the same limitations in output formats, but at
 * least a bilinear interpolation of a higher order polynomial on a finer
 * mesh.
 *
 * Note that after having called build_patches() once, you can call one or
 * more of the write() functions of DataOutInterface. You can therefore output
 * the same data in more than one format without having to rebuild the
 * patches.
 *
 *
 * <h3>User interface information</h3>
 *
 * The base classes of this class, DataOutBase, DataOutInterface and
 * DataOut_DoFData offer several interfaces of their own. Refer to the
 * DataOutBase class's documentation for a discussion of the different output
 * formats presently supported, DataOutInterface for ways of selecting which
 * format to use upon output at run-time and without the need to adapt your
 * program when new formats become available, as well as for flags to
 * determine aspects of output. The DataOut_DoFData() class's documentation
 * has an example of using nodal data to generate output.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Extensions</h3>
 *
 * By default, this class produces patches for all active cells. Sometimes,
 * this is not what you want, maybe because there are simply too many (and too
 * small to be seen individually) or because you only want to see a certain
 * region of the domain (for example only in the fluid part of the domain in
 * step-46), or for some other reason.
 *
 * For this, internally build_patches() does not generate the sequence of
 * cells to be converted into patches itself, but relies on the two function
 * that we'll call first_cell() and next_cell(). By default, they return the
 * first active cell, and the next active cell, respectively. But this can
 * be changed using the set_cell_selection() function that allows you to
 * replace this behavior. What set_cell_selection() wants to know is how
 * you want to pick out the first cell on which output should be generated,
 * and how given one cell on which output is generated you want to pick the
 * next cell.
 *
 * This may,
 * for example, include only cells that are in parts of a domain (e.g., if you
 * don't care about the solution elsewhere, think for example a buffer region
 * in which you attenuate outgoing waves in the Perfectly Matched Layer
 * method) or if you don't want output to be generated at all levels of an
 * adaptively refined mesh because this creates too much data (in this case,
 * the set of cells returned by your implementations of the `first_cell` and
 * `next_cell` arguments to set_cell_selection() will include
 * non-active cells, and DataOut::build_patches()
 * will simply take interpolated values of the solution instead of the exact
 * values on these cells children for output).

   * patch is, in essence, some intermediate representation of the data on
   * each cell of a triangulation and DoFHandler object that can then be used
   * to write files in some format that is readable by visualization programs.
   *
   * You can find an overview of the use of this function in the general
   * documentation of this class. An example is also provided in the
   * documentation of this class's base class DataOut_DoFData.
   *
   * @param n_subdivisions A parameter that determines how many "patches" this
   * function will build out of every cell. If you do not specify this value
   * in calling, or provide the default value zero, then this is interpreted
   * as DataOutInterface::default_subdivisions which most of the time will be
   * equal to one (unless you have set it to something else). The purpose of
   * this parameter is to subdivide each cell of the mesh into $2\times 2,
   * 3\times 3, \ldots$ "patches" in 2d, and $2\times 2\times 2, 3\times
   * 3\times 3, \ldots$ (if passed the value 2, 3, etc) where each patch
   * represents the data from a regular subdivision of the cell into equal
   * parts. Most of the times, this is not necessary and outputting one patch
   * per cell is exactly what you want to plot the solution. That said, the
   * data we write into files for visualization can only represent (bi-,
   * tri)linear data on each cell, and most visualization programs can in fact
   * only visualize this kind of data. That's good enough if you work with
   * (bi-, tri)linear finite elements, in which case what you get to see is
   * exactly what has been computed. On the other hand, if you work with (bi-,
   * tri)quadratic elements, then what is written into the output file is just
   * a (bi-, tri)linear interpolation onto the current mesh, i.e., only the
   * values at the vertices. If this is not good enough, you can, for example,
   * specify @p n_subdivisions equal to 2 to plot the solution on a once-
   * refined mesh, or if set to 3, on a mesh where each cell is represented by
   * 3-by-3 patches. On each of these smaller patches, given the limitations
   * of output formats, the data is still linearly interpolated, but a linear
   * interpolation of quadratic data on a finer mesh is still a better
   * representation of the actual quadratic surface than on the original mesh.
   * In other words, using this parameter can not help you plot the solution
   * exactly, but it can get you closer if you use finite elements of higher
   * polynomial degree.
   *
   * @note Specifying `n_subdivisions>1` is useful when using higher order
   *   finite elements, but in general it does not actually result in the
   *   visualization showing higher order polynomial surfaces -- rather, you
   *   just get a (bi-, tri-)linear interpolation of that higher order
   *   surface on a finer mesh. However, when outputting the solution in the
   *   VTK and VTU file formats via DataOutInterface::write_vtk() or
   *   DataOutInterface::write_vtu() (where DataOutInterface is a base
   *   class of the current class) as we often do in the tutorials,
   *   you can provide a set of flags via the DataOutBase::VtkFlags
   *   structure that includes the
   *   DataOutBase::VtkFlags::write_higher_order_cells flag. When set, the
   *   subdivisions produced by this function will be interpreted as
   *   support points for a higher order polynomial that will then actually
   *   be visualized as such. This is shown in step-11, for example. It
   *   is worth noting, however, that this requires a
   *   sufficiently new version of one of the VTK-based visualization
   *   programs.

   * MappingQEulerian result in curved cells in the interior of the domain.
   * The same is true if you have attached a manifold description to
   * the cells of a triangulation (see

   * part of the domain -- say, the fluid domain in a code such as step-46),
   * or to completely change *where* output is produced (e.g., to produce

   * to an overwhelming amount of data).

   *   triangulation this class works on and that should return the first cell
   *   on which output should be generated.
   * @param[in] next_cell A function object that takes as arguments the
   *   triangulation as well as the last cell
   *   on which output was generated, and that should return the next
   *   cell on which output should be generated. If there is no next
   *   cell, i.e., if the input argument to the `next_cell` function object
   *   is the last cell on which output is to be generated, then `next_cell`
   *   must return `triangulation.end()`.
   *
   * These function objects are not difficult to write, but also not immediately
