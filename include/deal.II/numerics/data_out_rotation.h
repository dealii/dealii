/**
 * This class generates output in the full domain of computations that were
 * done using rotational symmetry of domain and solution. In particular, if a
 * computation of a three dimensional problem with rotational symmetry around
 * the @p z-axis (i.e. in the @p r-z-plane) was done, then this class can be
 * used to generate the output in the original @p x-y-z space. In order to do
 * so, it generates from each cell in the computational mesh a cell in the
 * space with dimension one greater than that of the DoFHandler object. The
 * resulting output will then consist of hexahedra forming an object that has
 * rotational symmetry around the z-axis. As most graphical programs can not
 * represent ring-like structures, the angular (rotation) variable is
 * discretized into a finite number of intervals as well; the number of these
 * intervals must be given to the @p build_patches function. It is noted,
 * however, that while this function generates nice pictures of the whole
 * domain, it often produces <em>very</em> large output files.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Interface</h3>
 *
 * The interface of this class is copied from the DataOut class. Furthermore,
 * they share the common parent class DataOut_DoFData(). See the reference of
 * these two classes for a discussion of the interface and how to extend it by
 * deriving further classes from this class.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Details for 1d computations</h3>
 *
 * The one coordinate in the triangulation used by the DoFHandler object
 * passed to this class is taken as the radial variable, and the output will
 * then be either a circle or a ring domain. It is in the user's
 * responsibility to assure that the radial coordinate only attains non-
 * negative values.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Details for 2d computations</h3>
 *
 * We consider the computation (represented by the DoFHandler object that is
 * attached to this class) to have happened in the @p r-z-plane, where @p r is
 * the radial variable and @p z denotes the axis of revolution around which
 * the solution is symmetric. The output is in @p x-y-z space, where the
 * radial dependence is transformed to the @p x-y plane. At present, it is not
 * possible to exchange the meaning of the first and second variable of the
 * plane in which the simulation was made, i.e. generate output from a
 * simulation where the first variable denoted the symmetry axis, and the
 * second denoted the radial variable. You have to take that into account when
 * first programming your application.
 *
 * It is in the responsibility of the user to make sure that the radial
 * variable attains only non-negative values.
 *
 * @pre This class only makes sense if the first template argument,
 * <code>dim</code> equals the dimension of the DoFHandler type given as the
 * second template argument, i.e., if <code>dim == DH::dimension</code>. This
 * redundancy is a historical relic from the time where the library had only a
 * single DoFHandler class and this class consequently only a single template
 * argument.
