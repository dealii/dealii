/**
 * This namespace provides functions that compute a cell-wise approximation of
 * the norm of a derivative of a finite element field by taking difference
 * quotients between neighboring cells. This is a rather simple but efficient
 * form to get an error indicator, since it can be computed with relatively
 * little numerical effort and yet gives a reasonable approximation.
 *
 * The way the difference quotients are computed on cell $K$ is the following
 * (here described for the approximation of the gradient of a finite element
 * field, but see below for higher derivatives): let $K'$ be a neighboring
 * cell, and let $y_{K'}=x_{K'}-x_K$ be the distance vector between the
 * centers of the two cells, then $ \frac{u_h(x_{K'}) - u_h(x_K)}{ \|y_{K'}\|
 * }$ is an approximation of the directional derivative $ \nabla u(x_K) \cdot
 * \frac{y_{K'}}{ \|y_{K'}\| }.$ By multiplying both terms by $\frac{y_{K'}}{
 * \|y_{K'}\| }$ from the left and summing over all neighbors $K'$, we obtain
 * $ \sum_{K'} \left( \frac{y_{K'}}{ \|y_{K'}\|} \frac{y_{K'}^T}{ \|y_{K'}\| }
 * \right) \nabla u(x_K) \approx \sum_{K'} \left( \frac{y_{K'}}{ \|y_{K'}\|}
 * \frac{u_h(x_{K'}) - u_h(x_K)}{ \|y_{K'}\| }  \right).$
 *
 * Thus, if the matrix $ Y =  \sum_{K'} \left( \frac{y_{K'}}{\|y_{K'}\|}
 * \frac{y_{K'}^T}{ \|y_{K'}\| } \right)$ is regular (which is the case when
 * the vectors $y_{K'}$ to all neighbors span the whole space), we can obtain
 * an approximation to the true gradient by $ \nabla u(x_K) \approx Y^{-1}
 * \sum_{K'} \left( \frac{y_{K'}}{\|y_{K'}\|} \frac{u_h(x_{K'}) - u_h(x_K)}{
 * \|y_{K'}\| } \right).$ This is a quantity that is easily computed. The
 * value returned for each cell when calling the @p approximate_gradient
 * function of this class is the $l_2$ norm of this approximation to the
 * gradient. To make this a useful quantity, you may want to scale each
 * element by the correct power of the respective cell size.
 *
 * The computation of this quantity must fail if a cell has only neighbors for
 * which the direction vectors $y_K$ do not span the whole space, since then
 * the matrix $Y$ is no longer invertible. If this happens, you will get an
 * error similar to this one:
 * @code
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * An error occurred in line <749> of file <source/numerics/derivative_approximation.cc> in function
 *     void DerivativeApproximation::approximate(const Mapping<dim,spacedim>&, const DH<dim,spacedim>&, const InputVector&, unsigned int, const
 *  std::pair<unsigned int, unsigned int>&, Vector<float>&) [with DerivativeDescription = DerivativeApproximation::Gradient<3>, int
 * dim = 3, DH = DoFHandler, InputVector = Vector<double>]
 * The violated condition was:
 *     determinant(Y) != 0
 * The name and call sequence of the exception was:
 *     ExcInsufficientDirections()
 * Additional Information:
 * (none)
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * @endcode
 * As can easily be verified, this can only happen on very coarse grids, when
 * some cells and all their neighbors have not been refined even once. You
 * should therefore only call the functions of this class if all cells are at
 * least once refined. In practice this is not much of a restriction.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Approximation of higher derivatives</h3>
 *
 * Similar to the reasoning above, approximations to higher derivatives can be
 * computed in a similar fashion. For example, the tensor of second
 * derivatives is approximated by the formula $ \nabla^2 u(x_K) \approx Y^{-1}
 * \sum_{K'} \left( \frac{y_{K'}}{\|y_{K'}\|} \otimes \frac{\nabla u_h(x_{K'})
 * - \nabla u_h(x_K)}{ \|y_{K'}\| } \right), $ where $\otimes$ denotes the
 * outer product of two vectors. Note that unlike the true tensor of second
 * derivatives, its approximation is not necessarily symmetric. This is due to
 * the fact that in the derivation, it is not clear whether we shall consider
 * as projected second derivative the term $\nabla^2 u y_{KK'}$ or $y_{KK'}^T
 * \nabla^2 u$. Depending on which choice we take, we obtain one approximation
 * of the tensor of second derivatives or its transpose. To avoid this
 * ambiguity, as result we take the symmetrized form, which is the mean value
 * of the approximation and its transpose.
 *
 * The returned value on each cell is the spectral norm of the approximated
 * tensor of second derivatives, i.e. the largest eigenvalue by absolute
 * value. This equals the largest curvature of the finite element field at
 * each cell, and the spectral norm is the matrix norm associated to the $l_2$
 * vector norm.
 *
 * Even higher than the second derivative can be obtained along the same lines
 * as exposed above.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Refinement indicators based on the derivatives</h3>
 *
 * If you would like to base a refinement criterion upon these approximation
 * of the derivatives, you will have to scale the results of this class by an
 * appropriate power of the mesh width. For example, since $\|u-u_h\|^2_{L_2}
 * \le C h^2 \|\nabla u\|^2_{L_2}$, it might be the right thing to scale the
 * indicators as $\eta_K = h \|\nabla u\|_K$, i.e. $\eta_K = h^{1+d/2}
 * \|\nabla u\|_{\infty;K}$, i.e. the right power is $1+d/2$.
 *
 * Likewise, for the second derivative, one should choose a power of the mesh
 * size $h$ one higher than for the gradient.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 *
 * The formulae for the computation of approximations to the gradient and to
 * the tensor of second derivatives shown above are very much alike. The basic
 * difference is that in one case the finite difference quotient is a scalar,
 * while in the other case it is a vector. For higher derivatives, this would
 * be a tensor of even higher rank. We then have to form the outer product of
 * this difference quotient with the distance vector $y_{KK'}$, symmetrize it,
 * contract it with the matrix $Y^{-1}$ and compute its norm. To make the
 * implementation simpler and to allow for code reuse, all these operations
 * that are dependent on the actual order of the derivatives to be
 * approximated, as well as the computation of the quantities entering the
 * difference quotient, have been separated into auxiliary nested classes
 * (names @p Gradient and @p SecondDerivative) and the main algorithm is
 * simply passed one or the other data types and asks them to perform the
 * order dependent operations. The main framework that is independent of this,
 * such as finding all active neighbors, or setting up the matrix $Y$ is done
 * in the main function @p approximate.
 *
 * Due to this way of operation, the class may be easily extended for higher
 * oder derivatives than are presently implemented. Basically, only an
 * additional class along the lines of the derivative descriptor classes @p
 * Gradient and @p SecondDerivative has to be implemented, with the respective
 * typedefs and functions replaced by the appropriate analogues for the
 * derivative that is to be approximated.
