/**
 * A namespace for various smoothness estimation strategies for hp-adaptive FEM.
 *
 * Smoothness estimation is one strategy to decide whether a cell with a large
 * error estimate should undergo h- or p-refinement. Typical strategies decide
 * to increase the polynomial degree on a cell if the solution is particularly
 * smooth, whereas one would refine the mesh if the solution on the cell is
 * singular, has kinks in some derivative, or is otherwise not particularly
 * smooth. All of these strategies rely on a way to identify how "smooth" a
 * function is on a given cell.

   * Smoothness estimation strategy based on the decay of Legendre expansion
   * coefficients.
   *
   * In one dimension, the finite element solution on cell $K$ with polynomial
   * degree $p$ can be written as
   * @f{eqnarray*}
   *    u_h(x) &=& \sum_j u_j \varphi_j (x) \\
   *    u_{h, k}(x) &=& \sum_{k=0}^{p} a_k \widetilde P_k (x),
   *    \quad a_k = \sum_j {\cal L}_{k,j} u_j
   * @f}
   * where $u_j$ are degrees of freedom and $\varphi_j$ are the corresponding
   * shape functions. $\{\widetilde P_k(x)\}$ are Legendre polynomials on cell
   * $K$. $a_k$ and ${\cal L}_{k,j}$ are coefficients and transformation
   * matrices from the Legendre expansion of each shape function. For practical
   * reasons, we will perform the calculation of these matrices and coefficients
   * only on the reference cell $\hat K$. We only have to calculate the
   * transformation matrices once this way. However, results are only applicable
   * if the mapping from the reference cell to the actual cell is affine. We use
   * the class FESeries::Legendre to determine all coefficients $a_k$.
   *
   * A function is analytic, i.e., representable by a power series, if and only
   * if their Legendre expansion coefficients decay as (see @cite eibner2007hp)
   * @f[
   *   |a_k| \sim c \, \exp(-\sigma k)

   * We determine their decay rate $\sigma$ by performing the linear regression
   * fit of
   * @f[
   *   \ln |a_k| \sim C - \sigma k
   * @f]
   * for $k=0,\ldots,p$, with $p$ the polynomial degree of the finite element.
   * The rate of the decay $\sigma$ can be used to estimate the smoothness. For
   * example, one strategy to implement hp-refinement criteria is to perform
   * p-refinement if $\sigma>1$ (see @cite mavriplis1994hp).

     * For each finite element of the provided @p fe_collection, we use as many
     * modes as its polynomial degree plus two. Further for each element, we use
     * a 5-point Gaussian quarature iterated in each dimension by the maximal
     * wave number, which is the number of modes decreased by one since we start
     * with $k = 0$.
     *
     * As the Fourier expansion can only be performed on scalar fields, this
     * class does not operate on vector-valued finite elements and will
     * therefore throw an assertion. However, each component of a finite element
     * field can be treated as a scalar field, respectively, on which Fourier
     * expansions are again possible. For this purpose, the optional parameter
     * @p component defines which component of each FiniteElement will be used.
     * The default value of @p component only applies to scalar FEs, in which
     * case it indicates that the sole component is to be decomposed. For
     * vector-valued FEs, a non-default value must be explicitly provided.
