//TODO: Move documentation of functions to the functions!

/**
 * Provide a namespace which offers some operations on vectors. Among these
 * are assembling of standard vectors, integration of the difference of a
 * finite element solution and a continuous function, interpolations and
 * projections of continuous functions to the finite element space and other
 * operations.
 *
 * @note There exist two versions of almost all functions, one that takes an
 * explicit Mapping argument and one that does not. The second one generally
 * calls the first with an implicit $Q_1$ argument (i.e., with an argument of
 * kind MappingQGeneric(1)). If your intend your code to use a different
 * mapping than a (bi-/tri-)linear one, then you need to call the functions
 * <b>with</b> mapping argument should be used.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Description of operations</h3>
 *
 * This collection of methods offers the following operations:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Interpolation: assign each degree of freedom in the vector to be the
 * value of the function given as argument. This is identical to saying that
 * the resulting finite element function (which is isomorphic to the output
 * vector) has exact function values in all support points of trial functions.
 * The support point of a trial function is the point where its value equals
 * one, e.g. for linear trial functions the support points are four corners of
 * an element. This function therefore relies on the assumption that a finite
 * element is used for which the degrees of freedom are function values
 * (Lagrange elements) rather than gradients, normal derivatives, second
 * derivatives, etc (Hermite elements, quintic Argyris element, etc.).
 *
 * It seems inevitable that some values of the vector to be created are set
 * twice or even more than that. The reason is that we have to loop over all
 * cells and get the function values for each of the trial functions located
 * thereon. This applies also to the functions located on faces and corners
 * which we thus visit more than once. While setting the value in the vector
 * is not an expensive operation, the evaluation of the given function may be,
 * taking into account that a virtual function has to be called.
 *
 * <li> Projection: compute the <i>L</i><sup>2</sup>-projection of the given
 * function onto the finite element space, i.e. if <i>f</i> is the function to
 * be projected, compute <i>f<sub>h</sub></i> in <i>V<sub>h</sub></i> such
 * that
 * (<i>f<sub>h</sub></i>,<i>v<sub>h</sub></i>)=(<i>f</i>,<i>v<sub>h</sub></i>)
 * for all discrete test functions <i>v<sub>h</sub></i>. This is done through
 * the solution of the linear system of equations <i> M v = f</i> where
 * <i>M</i> is the mass matrix $m_{ij} = \int_\Omega \phi_i(x) \phi_j(x) dx$
 * and $f_i = \int_\Omega f(x) \phi_i(x) dx$. The solution vector $v$ then is
 * the nodal representation of the projection <i>f<sub>h</sub></i>. The
 * project() functions are used in the step-21 and step-23 tutorial programs.
 *
 * In order to get proper results, it be may necessary to treat boundary
 * conditions right. Below are listed some cases where this may be needed.  If
 * needed, this is done by <i>L</i><sup>2</sup>-projection of the trace of the
 * given function onto the finite element space restricted to the boundary of
 * the domain, then taking this information and using it to eliminate the
 * boundary nodes from the mass matrix of the whole domain, using the
 * MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values() function. The projection of the trace
 * of the function to the boundary is done with the
 * VectorTools::project_boundary_values() (see below) function, which is
 * called with a map of boundary functions
 * std::map<types::boundary_id, const Function<spacedim,number>*> in which all boundary
 * indicators from zero to numbers::internal_face_boundary_id-1
 * (numbers::internal_face_boundary_id is used for other purposes, see the
 * Triangulation class documentation) point to the function to be projected.
 * The projection to the boundary takes place using a second quadrature
 * formula on the boundary given to the project() function. The first
 * quadrature formula is used to compute the right hand side and for numerical
 * quadrature of the mass matrix.
 *
 * The projection of the boundary values first, then eliminating them from the
 * global system of equations is not needed usually. It may be necessary if
 * you want to enforce special restrictions on the boundary values of the
 * projected function, for example in time dependent problems: you may want to
 * project the initial values but need consistency with the boundary values
 * for later times. Since the latter are projected onto the boundary in each
 * time step, it is necessary that we also project the boundary values of the
 * initial values, before projecting them to the whole domain.
 *
 * Obviously, the results of the two schemes for projection are different.
 * Usually, when projecting to the boundary first, the
 * <i>L</i><sup>2</sup>-norm of the difference between original function and
 * projection over the whole domain will be larger (factors of five have been
 * observed) while the <i>L</i><sup>2</sup>-norm of the error integrated over
 * the boundary should of course be less. The reverse should also hold if no
 * projection to the boundary is performed.
 *
 * The selection whether the projection to the boundary first is needed is
 * done with the <tt>project_to_boundary_first</tt> flag passed to the
 * function.  If @p false is given, the additional quadrature formula for
 * faces is ignored.
 *
 * You should be aware of the fact that if no projection to the boundary is
 * requested, a function with zero boundary values may not have zero boundary
 * values after projection. There is a flag for this especially important
 * case, which tells the function to enforce zero boundary values on the
 * respective boundary parts. Since enforced zero boundary values could also
 * have been reached through projection, but are more economically obtain
 * using other methods, the @p project_to_boundary_first flag is ignored if
 * the @p enforce_zero_boundary flag is set.
 *
 * The solution of the linear system is presently done using a simple CG
 * method without preconditioning and without multigrid. This is clearly not
 * too efficient, but sufficient in many cases and simple to implement. This
 * detail may change in the future.
 *
 * <li> Creation of right hand side vectors: The create_right_hand_side()
 * function computes the vector $f_i = \int_\Omega f(x) \phi_i(x) dx$. This is
 * the same as what the <tt>MatrixCreator::create_*</tt> functions which take
 * a right hand side do, but without assembling a matrix.
 *
 * <li> Creation of right hand side vectors for point sources: The
 * create_point_source_vector() function computes the vector $f_i =
 * \int_\Omega \delta(x-x_0) \phi_i(x) dx$.
 *
 * <li> Creation of boundary right hand side vectors: The
 * create_boundary_right_hand_side() function computes the vector $f_i =
 * \int_{\partial\Omega} g(x) \phi_i(x) dx$. This is the right hand side
 * contribution of boundary forces when having inhomogeneous Neumann boundary
 * values in Laplace's equation or other second order operators. This function
 * also takes an optional argument denoting over which parts of the boundary
 * the integration shall extend. If the default argument is used, it is
 * applied to all boundaries.
 *
 * <li> Interpolation of boundary values: The
 * MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values() function takes a list of boundary
 * nodes and their values. You can get such a list by interpolation of a
 * boundary function using the interpolate_boundary_values() function. To use
 * it, you have to specify a list of pairs of boundary indicators (of type
 * <tt>types::boundary_id</tt>; see the section in the documentation of the
 * Triangulation class for more details) and the according functions denoting
 * the Dirichlet boundary values of the nodes on boundary faces with this
 * boundary indicator.
 *
 * Usually, all other boundary conditions, such as inhomogeneous Neumann
 * values or mixed boundary conditions are handled in the weak formulation. No
 * attempt is made to include these into the process of matrix and vector
 * assembly therefore.
 *
 * Within this function, boundary values are interpolated, i.e. a node is
 * given the point value of the boundary function. In some cases, it may be
 * necessary to use the L2-projection of the boundary function or any other
 * method. For this purpose we refer to the project_boundary_values() function
 * below.
 *
 * You should be aware that the boundary function may be evaluated at nodes on
 * the interior of faces. These, however, need not be on the true boundary,
 * but rather are on the approximation of the boundary represented by the
 * mapping of the unit cell to the real cell. Since this mapping will in most
 * cases not be the exact one at the face, the boundary function is evaluated
 * at points which are not on the boundary and you should make sure that the
 * returned values are reasonable in some sense anyway.
 *
 * In 1d the situation is a bit different since there faces (i.e. vertices)
 * have no boundary indicator. It is assumed that if the boundary indicator
 * zero is given in the list of boundary functions, the left boundary point is
 * to be interpolated while the right boundary point is associated with the
 * boundary index 1 in the map. The respective boundary functions are then
 * evaluated at the place of the respective boundary point.
 *
 * <li> Projection of boundary values: The project_boundary_values() function
 * acts similar to the interpolate_boundary_values() function, apart from the
 * fact that it does not get the nodal values of boundary nodes by
 * interpolation but rather through the <i>L</i><sup>2</sup>-projection of the
 * trace of the function to the boundary.
 *
 * The projection takes place on all boundary parts with boundary indicators
 * listed in the map (std::map<types::boundary_id, const Function<spacedim,number>*>)
 * of boundary functions. These
 * boundary parts may or may not be continuous. For these boundary parts, the
 * mass matrix is assembled using the
 * MatrixTools::create_boundary_mass_matrix() function, as well as the
 * appropriate right hand side. Then the resulting system of equations is
 * solved using a simple CG method (without preconditioning), which is in most
 * cases sufficient for the present purpose.
 *
 * <li> Computing errors: The function integrate_difference() performs the
 * calculation of the error between a given (continuous) reference function
 * and the finite element solution in different norms. The integration is
 * performed using a given quadrature formula and assumes that the given
 * finite element objects equals that used for the computation of the
 * solution.
 *
 * The result is stored in a vector (named @p difference), where each entry
 * equals the given norm of the difference on a cell. The order of entries is
 * the same as a @p cell_iterator takes when started with @p begin_active and
 * promoted with the <tt>++</tt> operator.
 *
 * This data, one number per active cell, can be used to generate graphical
 * output by directly passing it to the DataOut class through the
 * DataOut::add_data_vector function. Alternatively, it can be interpolated to
 * the nodal points of a finite element field using the
 * DoFTools::distribute_cell_to_dof_vector function.
 *
 * Presently, there is the possibility to compute the following values from
 * the difference, on each cell: @p mean, @p L1_norm, @p L2_norm, @p
 * Linfty_norm, @p H1_seminorm and @p H1_norm, see VectorTools::NormType. For
 * the mean difference value, the reference function minus the numerical
 * solution is computed, not the other way round.
 *
 * The infinity norm of the difference on a given cell returns the maximum
 * absolute value of the difference at the quadrature points given by the
 * quadrature formula parameter. This will in some cases not be too good an
 * approximation, since for example the Gauss quadrature formulae do not
 * evaluate the difference at the end or corner points of the cells. You may
 * want to choose a quadrature formula with more quadrature points or one with
 * another distribution of the quadrature points in this case. You should also
 * take into account the superconvergence properties of finite elements in
 * some points: for example in 1D, the standard finite element method is a
 * collocation method and should return the exact value at nodal points.
 * Therefore, the trapezoidal rule should always return a vanishing L-infinity
 * error. Conversely, in 2D the maximum L-infinity error should be located at
 * the vertices or at the center of the cell, which would make it plausible to
 * use the Simpson quadrature rule. On the other hand, there may be
 * superconvergence at Gauss integration points. These examples are not
 * intended as a rule of thumb, rather they are thought to illustrate that the
 * use of the wrong quadrature formula may show a significantly wrong result
 * and care should be taken to chose the right formula.
 *
 * The <i>H</i><sup>1</sup> seminorm is the <i>L</i><sup>2</sup> norm of the
 * gradient of the difference. The square of the full <i>H</i><sup>1</sup>
 * norm is the sum of the square of seminorm and the square of the
 * <i>L</i><sup>2</sup> norm.
 *
 * To get the global <i>L<sup>1</sup></i> error, you have to sum up the
 * entries in @p difference, e.g. using Vector::l1_norm() function.  For the
 * global <i>L</i><sup>2</sup> difference, you have to sum up the squares of
 * the entries and take the root of the sum, e.g. using Vector::l2_norm().
 * These two operations represent the <i>l</i><sub>1</sub> and
 * <i>l</i><sub>2</sub> norms of the vectors, but you need not take the
 * absolute value of each entry, since the cellwise norms are already
 * positive.
 *
 * To get the global mean difference, simply sum up the elements as above. To
 * get the $L_\infty$ norm, take the maximum of the vector elements, e.g.
 * using the Vector::linfty_norm() function.
 *
 * For the global <i>H</i><sup>1</sup> norm and seminorm, the same rule
 * applies as for the <i>L</i><sup>2</sup> norm: compute the
 * <i>l</i><sub>2</sub> norm of the cell error vector.
 *
 * Note that, in the codimension one case, if you ask for a norm that requires
 * the computation of a gradient, then the provided function is automatically
 * projected along the curve, and the difference is only computed on the
 * tangential part of the gradient, since no information is available on the
 * normal component of the gradient anyway.
 * </ul>
 *
 * All functions use the finite element given to the DoFHandler object the
 * last time that the degrees of freedom were distributed over the
 * triangulation. Also, if access to an object describing the exact form of
 * the boundary is needed, the pointer stored within the triangulation object
 * is accessed.

   * material ids of cells on the triangulation. Let 0: 0.0, 1: 1.0, 2: 2.0 be
   * the whole @p function_map that you want to pass to this function, where
   * @p key is a material id and @p value is a value of @p u. By using the
   * whole @p function_map you do not really know which values will be
   * assigned to the face DoFs. On the other hand, if you split the whole @p
   * function_map into three smaller independent objects 0: 0.0 and 1: 1.0 and
   * 2: 2.0 and make three distinct calls of this function passing each of
   * these objects separately (the order depends on what you want to get
   * between cells), then each subsequent call will rewrite the intercell @p
   * dofs of the previous one.

   * Compute Dirichlet boundary conditions.  This function makes up a map of

   * boundary. For each degree of freedom at the boundary, if its index
   * already exists in @p boundary_values then its boundary value will be
   * overwritten, otherwise a new entry with proper index and boundary value
   * for this degree of freedom will be inserted into @p boundary_values.
   *
   * The parameter @p function_map provides a list of boundary indicators to
   * be handled by this function and corresponding boundary value functions.
   * The keys of this map correspond to the number @p boundary_id of the face.
   * numbers::internal_face_boundary_id is an illegal value for this key since
   * it is reserved for interior faces.
   *
   * The flags in the last parameter, @p component_mask denote which
   * components of the finite element space shall be interpolated. If it is
   * left as specified by the default value (i.e. an empty array), all
   * components are interpolated. If it is different from the default value,
   * it is assumed that the number of entries equals the number of components
   * in the boundary functions and the finite element, and those components in
   * the given boundary function will be used for which the respective flag
   * was set in the component mask. See also
   * @ref GlossComponentMask.
   * As an example, assume that you are solving the Stokes equations in 2d,
   * with variables $(u,v,p)$ and that you only want to interpolate boundary
   * values for the velocity, then the component mask should correspond to
   * <code>(true,true,false)</code>.
   *
   * @note Whether a component mask has been specified or not, the number of
   * components of the functions in @p function_map must match that of the
   * finite element used by @p dof. In other words, for the example above, you
   * need to provide a Function object that has 3 components (the two
   * velocities and the pressure), even though you are only interested in the
   * first two of them. interpolate_boundary_values() will then call this
   * function to obtain a vector of 3 values at each interpolation point but
   * only take the first two and discard the third. In other words, you are
   * free to return whatever you like in the third component of the vector
   * returned by Function::vector_value, but the Function object must state
   * that it has 3 components.
   *
   * If the finite element used has shape functions that are non-zero in more
   * than one component (in deal.II speak: they are non-primitive), then these
   * components can presently not be used for interpolating boundary values.
   * Thus, the elements in the component mask corresponding to the components
   * of these non-primitive shape functions must be @p false.

   *
   * @param[in] mapping The mapping that will be used in the transformations
   * necessary to integrate along the boundary.
   * @param[in] dof The DoFHandler that describes the finite element space and
   * the numbering of degrees of freedom.
   * @param[in] boundary_functions A map from boundary indicators to pointers
   * to functions that describe the desired values on those parts of the
   * boundary marked with this boundary indicator (see
   * @ref GlossBoundaryIndicator "Boundary indicator").
   * The projection happens on only those parts of the boundary whose
   * indicators are represented in this map.
   * @param[in] q The face quadrature used in the integration necessary to
   * compute the mass matrix and right hand side of the projection.
   * @param[out] boundary_values The result of this function. It is a map
   * containing all indices of degrees of freedom at the boundary (as covered
   * by the boundary parts in @p boundary_functions) and the computed dof
   * value for this degree of freedom. For each degree of freedom at the
   * boundary, if its index already exists in @p boundary_values then its
   * boundary value will be overwritten, otherwise a new entry with proper
   * index and boundary value for this degree of freedom will be inserted into
   * @p boundary_values.
   * @param[in] component_mapping It is sometimes convenient to project a
   * vector-valued function onto only parts of a finite element space (for
   * example, to project a function with <code>dim</code> components onto the
   * velocity components of a <code>dim+1</code> component DoFHandler for a
   * Stokes problem). To allow for this, this argument allows components to be
   * remapped. If the vector is not empty, it has to have one entry for each
   * vector component of the finite element used in @p dof. This entry is the
   * component number in @p boundary_functions that should be used for this
   * component in @p dof. By default, no remapping is applied.

  /**
   * This function is an updated version of the
   * project_boundary_values_curl_conforming function. The intention is to fix
   * a problem when using the previous function in conjunction with non-
   * rectangular geometries (i.e. elements with non-rectangular faces). The
   * L2-projection method used has been taken from the paper "Electromagnetic
   * scattering simulation using an H (curl) conforming hp finite element
   * method in three dimensions" by PD Ledger, K Morgan and O Hassan ( Int. J.
   * Num. Meth. Fluids, Volume 53, Issue 8, pages 1267–1296).
   *
   * This function will compute constraints that correspond to Dirichlet
   * boundary conditions of the form
   * $\vec{n}\times\vec{E}=\vec{n}\times\vec{F}$ i.e. the tangential
   * components of $\vec{E}$ and $f$ shall coincide.
   *
   * <h4>Computing constraints</h4>
   *
   * To compute the constraints we use a projection method based upon the
   * paper mentioned above. In 2D this is done in a single stage for the edge-
   * based shape functions, regardless of the order of the finite element. In
   * 3D this is done in two stages, edges first and then faces.
   *
   * For each cell, each edge, $e$, is projected by solving the linear system
   * $Ax=b$ where $x$ is the vector of contraints on degrees of freedom on the
   * edge and
   *
   * $A_{ij} = \int_{e} (\vec{s}_{i}\cdot\vec{t})(\vec{s}_{j}\cdot\vec{t}) dS$
   *
   * $b_{i} = \int_{e} (\vec{s}_{i}\cdot\vec{t})(\vec{F}\cdot\vec{t}) dS$
   *
   * with $\vec{s}_{i}$ the $i^{th}$ shape function and $\vec{t}$ the tangent
   * vector.
   *
   * Once all edge constraints, $x$, have been computed, we may compute the
   * face constraints in a similar fashion, taking into account the residuals
   * from the edges.
   *
   * For each face on the cell, $f$, we solve the linear system $By=c$ where
   * $y$ is the vector of constraints on degrees of freedom on the face and
   *
   * $B_{ij} = \int_{f} (\vec{n} \times \vec{s}_{i}) \cdot (\vec{n} \times
   * \vec{s}_{j}) dS$
   *
   * $c_{i} = \int_{f} (\vec{n} \times \vec{r}) \cdot (\vec{n} \times
   * \vec{s}_i) dS$
   *
   * and $\vec{r} = \vec{F} - \sum_{e \in f} \sum{i \in e} x_{i}\vec{s}_i$,
   * the edge residual.
   *
   * The resulting constraints are then given in the solutions $x$ and $y$.
   *
   * If the ConstraintMatrix @p constraints contained values or other
   * constraints before, the new ones are added or the old ones overwritten,
   * if a node of the boundary part to be used was already in the list of
   * constraints. This is handled by using inhomogeneous constraints. Please
   * note that when combining adaptive meshes and this kind of constraints,
   * the Dirichlet conditions should be set first, and then completed by
   * hanging node constraints, in order to make sure that the discretization
   * remains consistent. See the discussion on conflicting constraints in the
   * module on
   * @ref constraints.
   *
   * <h4>Arguments to this function</h4>
   *
   * This function is explicitly for use with FE_Nedelec elements, or with
   * FESystem elements which contain FE_Nedelec elements. It will throw an
   * exception if called with any other finite element. The user must ensure
   * that FESystem elements are correctly setup when using this function as
   * this check not possible in this case.
   *
   * The second argument of this function denotes the first vector component
   * of the finite element which corresponds to the vector function that you
   * wish to constrain. For example, if we are solving Maxwell's equations in
   * 3D and have components $(E_x,E_y,E_z,B_x,B_y,B_z)$ and we want the
   * boundary conditions $\vec{n}\times\vec{B}=\vec{n}\times\vec{f}$, then @p
   * first_vector_component would be 3. The @p boundary_function must return 6
   * components in this example, with the first 3 corresponding to $\vec{E}$
   * and the second 3 corresponding to $\vec{B}$. Vectors are implicitly
   * assumed to have exactly <code>dim</code> components that are ordered in
   * the same way as we usually order the coordinate directions, i.e. $x$-,

  /**
   * This function computes the constraints that correspond to boundary
   * conditions of the form $\vec u \cdot \vec n=\vec u_\Gamma \cdot \vec n$,
   * i.e., normal flux constraints where $\vec u$ is a vector-valued solution
   * variable and $\vec u_\Gamma$ is a prescribed vector field whose normal
   * component we want to be equal to the normal component of the solution.
   * These conditions have exactly the form handled by the ConstraintMatrix
   * class, in that they relate a <i>linear combination</i> of boundary degrees
   * of freedom to a corresponding value (the inhomogeneity of the constraint).
   * Consequently, the current function creates a list of constraints that are
   * written into a ConstraintMatrix. This object may already have some
   * content, for example from hanging node constraints, that remains
   * untouched. These constraints have to be applied to the linear system like
   * any other such constraints, i.e., you have to condense the linear system
   * with the constraints before solving, and you have to distribute the
   * solution vector afterwards.
   *
   * This function treats a more general case than
   * VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints() (which can only handle
   * the case where $\vec u_\Gamma \cdot \vec n = 0$, and is used in
   * step-31 and step-32). However, because everything that would apply
   * to that function also applies as a special case to the current
   * function, the following discussion is relevant to both.
   *
   * @note This function doesn't make much sense in 1d, so it throws an
   *   exception if @p dim equals one.
   *
   *
   * <h4>Arguments to this function</h4>
   *
   * The second argument of this function denotes the first vector component
   * in the finite element that corresponds to the vector function that you
   * want to constrain. For example, if we were solving a Stokes equation in
   * 2d and the finite element had components $(u,v,p)$, then @p
   * first_vector_component needs to be zero if you intend to constraint
   * the vector $(u,v)^T \cdot \vec n = \vec u_\Gamma \cdot \vec n$.
   * On the other hand, if we solved the
   * Maxwell equations in 3d and the finite element has components
   * $(E_x,E_y,E_z,B_x,B_y,B_z)$ and we want the boundary condition $\vec
   * B\cdot \vec n=\vec B_\Gamma\cdot \vec n$, then @p first_vector_component
   * would be 3. Vectors are implicitly assumed to have exactly
   * <code>dim</code> components that are ordered in the same way as we
   * usually order the coordinate directions, i.e. $x$-, $y$-, and finally
   * $z$-component. The function assumes, but can't check, that the vector
   * components in the range
   * <code>[first_vector_component,first_vector_component+dim)</code> come
   * from the same base finite element. For example, in the Stokes example
   * above, it would not make sense to use a
   * <code>FESystem@<dim@>(FE_Q@<dim@>(2), 1, FE_Q@<dim@>(1), dim)</code>
   * (note that the first velocity vector component is a $Q_2$ element,
   * whereas all the other ones are $Q_1$ elements) as there would be points
   * on the boundary where the $x$-velocity is defined but no corresponding
   * $y$- or $z$-velocities.
   *
   * The third argument denotes the set of boundary indicators on which the
   * boundary condition is to be enforced. Note that, as explained below, this
   * is one of the few functions where it makes a difference where we call the
   * function multiple times with only one boundary indicator, or whether we
   * call the function once with the whole set of boundary indicators at once.
   *
   * The fourth parameter describes the boundary function that is used for
   * computing these constraints.
   *
   * The mapping argument is used to compute the boundary points at which the
   * function needs to request the normal vector $\vec n$ from the boundary
   * description.
   *
   * @note When combining adaptively refined meshes with hanging node
   * constraints and boundary conditions like from the current function within
   * one ConstraintMatrix object, the hanging node constraints should always
   * be set first, and then the boundary conditions since boundary conditions
   * are not set in the second operation on degrees of freedom that are
   * already constrained. This makes sure that the discretization remains
   * conforming as is needed. See the discussion on conflicting constraints in
   * the module on
   * @ref constraints.
   *
   *
   * <h4>Computing constraints in 2d</h4>
   *
   * Computing these constraints requires some smarts. The main question
   * revolves around the question what the normal vector is. Consider the
   * following situation:
   *
   * <p ALIGN="center">
   * @image html no_normal_flux_1.png
   * </p>
   *
   * Here, we have two cells that use a bilinear mapping (i.e.,
   * MappingQGeneric(1)). Consequently, for each of the cells, the normal
   * vector is perpendicular to the straight edge. If the two edges at the top
   * and right are meant to approximate a curved boundary (as indicated by the
   * dashed line), then neither of the two computed normal vectors are equal
   * to the exact normal vector (though they approximate it as the mesh is
   * refined further). What is worse, if we constrain $\vec u \cdot \vec n=
   * \vec u_\Gamma \cdot \vec n$ at the common vertex with the normal vector
   * from both cells, then we constrain the vector $\vec u$ with respect to
   * two linearly independent vectors; consequently, the constraint would be
   * $\vec u=\vec u_\Gamma$ at this point (i.e. <i>all</i> components of the
   * vector), which is not what we wanted.
   *
   * To deal with this situation, the algorithm works in the following way: at
   * each point where we want to constrain $\vec u$, we first collect all
   * normal vectors that adjacent cells might compute at this point. We then
   * do not constrain $\vec u \cdot \vec n=\vec u_\Gamma \cdot \vec n$ for
   * <i>each</i> of these normal vectors but only for the <i>average</i> of
   * the normal vectors. In the example above, we therefore record only a
   * single constraint $\vec u \cdot \vec {\bar n}=\vec u_\Gamma \cdot \vec
   * {\bar n}$, where $\vec {\bar n}$ is the average of the two indicated
   * normal vectors.
   *
   * Unfortunately, this is not quite enough. Consider the situation here:
   *
   * <p ALIGN="center">
   * @image html no_normal_flux_2.png
   * </p>
   *
   * If again the top and right edges approximate a curved boundary, and the
   * left boundary a separate boundary (for example straight) so that the
   * exact boundary has indeed a corner at the top left vertex, then the above
   * construction would not work: here, we indeed want the constraint that
   * $\vec u$ at this point (because the normal velocities with respect to
   * both the left normal as well as the top normal vector should be zero),
   * not that the velocity in the direction of the average normal vector is
   * zero.
   *
   * Consequently, we use the following heuristic to determine whether all
   * normal vectors computed at one point are to be averaged: if two normal
   * vectors for the same point are computed on <i>different</i> cells, then
   * they are to be averaged. This covers the first example above. If they are
   * computed from the same cell, then the fact that they are different is
   * considered indication that they come from different parts of the boundary
   * that might be joined by a real corner, and must not be averaged.
   *
   * There is one problem with this scheme. If, for example, the same domain
   * we have considered above, is discretized with the following mesh, then we
   * get into trouble:
   *
   * <p ALIGN="center">
   * @image html no_normal_flux_3.png
   * </p>
   *
   * Here, the algorithm assumes that the boundary does not have a corner at
   * the point where faces $F1$ and $F2$ join because at that point there are
   * two different normal vectors computed from different cells. If you intend
   * for there to be a corner of the exact boundary at this point, the only
   * way to deal with this is to assign the two parts of the boundary
   * different boundary indicators and call this function twice, once for each
   * boundary indicators; doing so will yield only one normal vector at this
   * point per invocation (because we consider only one boundary part at a
   * time), with the result that the normal vectors will not be averaged. This
   * situation also needs to be taken into account when using this function
   * around reentrant corners on Cartesian meshes. If normal-flux boundary
   * conditions are to be enforced on non-Cartesian meshes around reentrant
   * corners, one may even get cycles in the constraints as one will in
   * general constrain different components from the two sides. In that case,
   * set a no-slip constraint on the reentrant vertex first.
   *
   *
   * <h4>Computing constraints in 3d</h4>
   *
   * The situation is more complicated in 3d. Consider the following case
   * where we want to compute the constraints at the marked vertex:
   *
   * <p ALIGN="center">
   * @image html no_normal_flux_4.png
   * </p>
   *
   * Here, we get four different normal vectors, one from each of the four
   * faces that meet at the vertex. Even though they may form a complete set
   * of vectors, it is not our intent to constrain all components of the
   * vector field at this point. Rather, we would like to still allow
   * tangential flow, where the term "tangential" has to be suitably defined.
   *
   * In a case like this, the algorithm proceeds as follows: for each cell
   * that has computed two tangential vectors at this point, we compute the
   * unconstrained direction as the outer product of the two tangential
   * vectors (if necessary multiplied by minus one). We then average these
   * tangential vectors. Finally, we compute constraints for the two
   * directions perpendicular to this averaged tangential direction.
   *
   * There are cases where one cell contributes two tangential directions and
   * another one only one; for example, this would happen if both top and
   * front faces of the left cell belong to the boundary selected whereas only
   * the top face of the right cell belongs to it, maybe indicating the the
   * entire front part of the domain is a smooth manifold whereas the top
   * really forms two separate manifolds that meet in a ridge, and that
   * normal-flux boundary conditions are only desired on the front manifold
   * and the right one on top. In cases like these, it's difficult to define
   * what should happen. The current implementation simply ignores the one
   * contribution from the cell that only contributes one normal vector. In
   * the example shown, this is acceptable because the normal vector for the
   * front face of the left cell is the same as the normal vector provided by
   * the front face of the right cell (the surface is planar) but it would be
   * a problem if the front manifold would be curved. Regardless, it is
   * unclear how one would proceed in this case and ignoring the single cell
   * is likely the best one can do.
   *
   *
   * <h4>Results</h4>
   *
   * Because it makes for good pictures, here are two images of vector fields
   * on a circle and on a sphere to which the constraints computed by this
   * function have been applied (for illustration purposes, we enforce zero
   * normal flux, which can more easily be computed using
   * VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints(), as this must
   * lead to a <i>tangential</i> vector field):
   *
   * <p ALIGN="center">
   * @image html no_normal_flux_5.png
   * @image html no_normal_flux_6.png
   * </p>
   *
   * The vectors fields are not physically reasonable but the tangentiality
   * constraint is clearly enforced. The fact that the vector fields are zero
   * at some points on the boundary is an artifact of the way it is created,
   * it is not constrained to be zero at these points.

  /**
   * Compute the error of the finite element solution.  Integrate the
   * difference between a reference function which is given as a continuous
   * function object, and a finite element function. The result of this
   * function is the vector @p difference that contains one value per active
   * cell $K$ of the triangulation. Each of the values of this vector $d$
   * equals
   * @f{align*}{
   * d_K = \| u-u_h \|_X
   * @f}
   * where $X$ denotes the norm chosen and $u$ represents the exact solution.
   *
   * It is assumed that the number of components of the function @p
   * exact_solution matches that of the finite element used by @p dof.
   *
   * @param[in] mapping The mapping that is used when integrating the
   * difference $u-u_h$.
   * @param[in] dof The DoFHandler object that describes the finite element
   * space in which the solution vector lives.
   * @param[in] fe_function A vector with nodal values representing the
   * numerical approximation $u_h$. This vector needs to correspond to the
   * finite element space represented by @p dof.
   * @param[in] exact_solution The exact solution that is used to compute the
   * error.
   * @param[out] difference The vector of values $d_K$ computed as above.
   * @param[in] q The quadrature formula used to approximate the integral
   * shown above. Note that some quadrature formulas are more useful than
   * other in integrating $u-u_h$. For example, it is known that the $Q_1$
   * approximation $u_h$ to the exact solution $u$ of a Laplace equation is
   * particularly accurate (in fact, superconvergent, i.e. accurate to higher
   * order) at the 4 Gauss points of a cell in 2d (or 8 points in 3d) that
   * correspond to a QGauss(2) object. Consequently, because a QGauss(2)
   * formula only evaluates the two solutions at these particular points,
   * choosing this quadrature formula may indicate an error far smaller than
   * it actually is.
   * @param[in] norm The norm $X$ shown above that should be computed. If the
   * norm is NormType::Hdiv_seminorm, then the finite element on which this
   * function is called needs to have at least dim vector components, and the
   * divergence will be computed on the first div components. This works, for
   * example, on the finite elements used for the mixed Laplace (step-20) and
   * the Stokes equations (step-22).
   * @param[in] weight The additional argument @p weight allows to evaluate
   * weighted norms.  The weight function may be scalar, establishing a
   * spatially variable weight in the domain for all components equally. This
   * may be used, for instance, to only integrate over parts of the domain.
   * The weight function may also be vector-valued, with as many components as
   * the finite element: Then, different components get different weights. A
   * typical application is when the error with respect to only one or a
   * subset of the solution variables is to be computed, in which case the
   * other components would have weight values equal to zero. The
   * ComponentSelectFunction class is particularly useful for this purpose as
   * it provides such a "mask" weight. The weight function is expected to be
   * positive, but negative values are not filtered. The default value of this
   * function, a null pointer, is interpreted as "no weighting function",
   * i.e., weight=1 in the whole domain for all vector components uniformly.
   * @param[in] exponent This value denotes the $p$ used in computing
   * $L^p$-norms and $W^{1,p}$-norms. The value is ignores if a @p norm other
   * than NormType::Lp_norm or NormType::W1p_norm is chosen.
   *
   *
   * See the general documentation of this namespace for more information.
   *
   * @note If the integration here happens over the cells of a
   * parallel::distribute::Triangulation object, then this function computes
   * the vector elements $d_K$ for an output vector with as many cells as
   * there are active cells of the triangulation object of the current
   * processor. However, not all active cells are in fact locally owned: some
   * may be ghost or artificial cells (see
   * @ref GlossGhostCell "here"
   * and
   * @ref GlossArtificialCell "here").
   * The vector computed will, in the case of a distributed triangulation,
   * contain zeros for cells that are not locally owned. As a consequence, in
   * order to compute the <i>global</i> $L_2$ error (for example), the errors
   * from different processors need to be combined, but this is simple because
   * every processor only computes contributions for those cells of the global
   * triangulation it locally owns (and these sets are, by definition,
   * mutually disjoint). Consequently, the following piece of code computes
   * the global $L_2$ error across multiple processors sharing a
   * parallel::distribute::Triangulation:
   * @code
   *    Vector<double> local_errors (tria.n_active_cells());
   *    VectorTools::integrate_difference (mapping, dof,
   *                                       solution, exact_solution,
   *                                       local_errors,
   *                                       QGauss<dim>(fe.degree+2),
   *                                       VectorTools::L2_norm);
   *    const double total_local_error = local_errors.l2_norm();
   *    const double total_global_error
   *      = std::sqrt (Utilities::MPI::sum (total_local_error * total_local_error, MPI_COMM_WORLD));
   * @endcode
   * The squaring and taking the square root is necessary in order to compute
   * the sum of squares of norms over all all cells in the definition of the
   * $L_2$ norm:
   * @f{align*}{
   * \textrm{error} = \sqrt{\sum_K \|u-u_h\|_{L_2(K)}^2}
   * @f}
   * Obviously, if you are interested in computing the $L_1$ norm of the
   * error, the correct form of the last two lines would have been
   * @code
   *    const double total_local_error = local_errors.l1_norm();
   *    const double total_global_error
   *      = Utilities::MPI::sum (total_local_error, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
   * @endcode
   * instead, and similar considerations hold when computing the $L_\infty$
   * norm of the error.
   *
   * Instantiations for this template are provided for some vector types (see
   * the general documentation of the namespace), but only for InVectors as in

  /**
   * Subtract the (algebraic) mean value from a vector.
   *
   * This function is most frequently used as a mean-value filter for Stokes:
   * The pressure in Stokes' equations with only Dirichlet boundaries for the
   * velocities is only determined up to a constant. This function allows to
   * subtract the mean value of the pressure. It is usually called in a
   * preconditioner and generates updates with mean value zero. The mean value
   * is computed as the mean value of the degrees of freedom values as given
   * by the input vector; they are not weighted by the area of cells, i.e. the
   * mean is computed as $\sum_i v_i$, rather than as $\int_\Omega v(x) =
   * \int_\Omega \sum_i v_i \phi_i(x)$. The latter can be obtained from the
   * VectorTools::compute_mean_function, however.
   *
   * Apart from the vector @p v to operate on, this function takes a boolean
   * mask @p p_select that has a true entry for every element of the vector
   * for which the mean value shall be computed and later subtracted. The
   * argument is used to denote which components of the solution vector
   * correspond to the pressure, and avoid touching all other components of
   * the vector, such as the velocity components. (Note, however, that the
   * mask is not a
   * @ref GlossComponentMask
   * operating on the vector components of the finite element the solution
   * vector @p v may be associated with; rather, it is a mask on the entire
   * vector, without reference to what the vector elements mean.)
   *
   * The boolean mask @p p_select has an empty vector as default value, which
   * will be interpreted as selecting all vector elements, hence, subtracting
   * the algebraic mean value on the whole vector. This allows to call this
   * function without a boolean mask if the whole vector should be processed.
   *
   * @note In the context of using this function to filter out the kernel of
   * an operator (such as the null space of the Stokes operator that consists
   * of the constant pressures), this function only makes sense for finite
   * elements for which the null space indeed consists of the vector
   * $(1,1,\ldots,1)^T$. This is the case for example for the usual Lagrange
   * elements where the sum of all shape functions equals the function that is
   * constant one. However, it is not true for some other functions: for
   * example, for the FE_DGP element (another valid choice for the pressure in
   * Stokes discretizations), the first shape function on each cell is
   * constant while further elements are $L_2$ orthogonal to it (on the
   * reference cell); consequently, the sum of all shape functions is not
   * equal to one, and the vector that is associated with the constant mode is
   * not equal to $(1,1,\ldots,1)^T$. For such elements, a different procedure
   * has to be used when subtracting the mean value.
