  /**
   * This is an interpolation function for the given dof handler and the given
   * solution vector. The points at which this function can be evaluated MUST
   * be inside the domain of the dof handler, but except from this, no other
   * requirement is given. This function is rather slow, as it needs to
   * construct a quadrature object for the point (or set of points) where you
   * want to evaluate your finite element function. In order to do so, it
   * needs to find out where the points lie.
   *
   * @note This function is not intended for assembling a vector or a
   * matrix on a cell-by-cell basis. Tailored access through FEValues
   * or similar is recommended then. In such a case, the class
   * DoFVector may be helpful.
   *
   * If you know in advance in which cell your points lie, you can accelerate
   * things a bit, by calling set_active_cell before asking for values or
   * gradients of the function. If you don't do this, and your points don't
   * lie in the cell that is currently stored, the function
   * GridTools::find_cell_around_point is called to find out where the point
   * is. You can specify an optional mapping to use when looking for points in
   * the grid. If you don't do so, this function uses a Q1 mapping.
   *
   * Once the FEFieldFunction knows where the points lie, it creates a
   * quadrature formula for those points, and calls
   * FEValues::get_function_values or FEValues::get_function_gradients with
   * the given quadrature points.
   *
   * If you only need the quadrature points but not the values of the finite
   * element function (you might want this for the adjoint interpolation), you
   * can also use the function @p compute_point_locations alone.
   *
   * An example of how to use this function is the following:
   *
   * @code
   *
   * // Generate two triangulations
   * Triangulation<dim> tria_1;
   * Triangulation<dim> tria_2;
   *
   * // Read the triangulations from files, or build them up, or get them
   * // from some place. Assume that tria_2 is *entirely* included in tria_1.
   *
   * // Associate a dof handler and a solution to the first triangulation
   * DoFHandler<dim> dh1 (tria_1);
   * Vector<double> solution_1;
   *
   * // Do the same with the second
   * DoFHandler<dim> dh2 (tria_2);
   * Vector<double> solution_2;
   *
   * // Setup the system, assemble matrices, solve problems and get the
   * // nobel prize on the first domain...
   *
   * // Now project it to the second domain
   * FEFieldFunction<dim> fe_function_1 (dh_1, solution_1);
   * VectorTools::project (dh_2, constraints_2, quad, fe_function_1, solution_2);
   *
   * // Or interpolate it...
   * Vector<double> solution_3;
   * VectorTools::interpolate (dh_2, fe_function_1, solution_3);
   *
   * @endcode
   *
   * The snippet of code above will work assuming that the second
   * triangulation is entirely included in the first one.
   *
   * FEFieldFunction is designed to be an easy way to get the results of your
   * computations across different, possibly non matching, grids. No knowledge
   * of the location of the points is assumed in this class, which makes it
   * rely entirely on the GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point utility for
   * its job. However the class can be fed an "educated guess" of where the
   * points that will be computed actually are by using the
   * FEFieldFunction::set_active_cell method, so if you have a smart way to
   * tell where your points are, you will save a lot of computational time by
   * letting this class know.
   *
   *
   * <h3>Using FEFieldFunction with parallel::distributed::Triangulation</h3>
   *
   * When using this class with a parallel distributed triangulation object
   * and evaluating the solution at a particular point, not every processor
   * will own the cell at which the solution is evaluated. Rather, it may be
   * that the cell in which this point is found is in fact a ghost or
   * artificial cell (see
   * @ref GlossArtificialCell
   * and
   * @ref GlossGhostCell).
   * If the cell is artificial, we have no access to the solution there and
   * functions that evaluate the solution at such a point will trigger an
   * exception of type VectorTools::ExcPointNotAvailableHere. The same kind of
   * exception will also be produced if the cell is a ghost cell: On such
   * cells, one could in principle evaluate the solution, but it becomes
   * easier if we do not allow to do so because then there is exactly one
   * processor in a parallel distributed computation that can indeed evaluate
   * the solution. Consequently, it is clear which processor is responsible
   * for producing output if the point evaluation is done as a postprocessing
   * step.
   *
   * To deal with this situation, you will want to use code as follows when,
   * for example, evaluating the solution at the origin (here using a parallel
   * TrilinosWrappers vector to hold the solution):
   * @code
   *   Functions::FEFieldFunction<dim,DoFHandler<dim>,TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector>
   *     solution_function (dof_handler, solution);
   *   Point<dim> origin = Point<dim>();
   *
   *   double solution_at_origin;
   *   bool   point_found = true;
   *   try
   *     {
   *       solution_at_origin = solution_function.value (origin);
   *     }
   *   catch (const VectorTools::ExcPointNotAvailableHere &)
   *     {
   *       point_found = false;
   *     }
   *
   *   if (point_found == true)
   *     ...do something...;
   * @endcode
