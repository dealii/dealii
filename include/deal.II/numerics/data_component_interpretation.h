   * The members of this enum are used to describe the logical interpretation
   * of what the various components of a vector-valued data set mean. For
   * example, if one has a finite element for the Stokes equations in 2d,
   * representing components $(u,v,p)$, one would like to indicate that the
   * first two, $u$ and $v$, represent a logical vector so that later on when
   * we generate graphical output we can hand them off to a visualization
   * program that will automatically know to render them as a vector field,
   * rather than as two separate and independent scalar fields.
   *
   * By passing a set of enums of the current kind to the
   * DataOut_DoFData::add_data_vector functions, this can be achieved.
   *
   * See the step-22 tutorial program for an example on how this information
   * can be used in practice.
