  /**
   * Create a right hand side vector for a point source at point @p p. In
   * other words, it creates a vector $F$ so that $F_i = \int_\Omega
   * \delta(x-p) \varphi_i(x) dx$ where $\varphi_i$ are the shape functions
   * described by @p dof_handler and @p p is the point at which the delta
   * function is located. Prior content of the given @p rhs_vector
   * vector is deleted. This function is for the case of a scalar finite
   * element.
   *
   * This function is typically used in one of these two contexts:
   * - Let's say you want to solve the same kind of problems many times
   *   over, with different values for right hand sides or coefficients,
   *   and then evaluate the solution at the same point every time. You
   *   could do this by calling VectorTools::point_value() after each
   *   solve, or you could realize that to evaluate the solution $u_h$
   *   at a point $p$, you could rearrange operations like this:
   *   @f{align*}{
   *     u_h(p) &= \sum_j U_j \varphi_j(p) = \sum_j U_j F_j
   *       \\   &= U \cdot F
   *   @f}
   *   with the vector as defined above. In other words, point evaluation
   *   can be achieved with just a single vector-vector product, and the
   *   vector $F$ can be computed once and for all and reused
   *   for each solve, without having to go through the mesh every time
   *   to find out which cell (and where in the cell) the point $p$ is
   *   located.
   * - This function is also useful if you wanted to compute the Green's
   *   function for the problem you are solving. This is because the
   *   Green's function $G(x,p)$ is defined by
   *   @f{align*}{
   *     L G(x,p) &= \delta(x-p)
   *   @f}
   *   where $L$ is the differential operator of your problem. The discrete
   *   version then requires computing the right hand side vector
   *   $F_i = \int_\Omega \varphi_i(x) \delta(x-p)$, which is exactly
   *   the vector computed by the current function.
   *
   * While maybe not relevant for documenting <i>what</i> this
   * function does, it may be interesting to note that delta functions
   * do not exist in reality, and consequently, using this function
   * does not model any real situation. This is, because no real
   * object is able to focus an infinite force density at an
   * infinitesimally small part of the domain (rather, all real
   * devices will spread out the force over a finite area); nor is it
   * possible to measure values at individual points (but all
   * measurements will somehow be averaged over small areas). Only if
   * this area is so small that it cannot be resolved by any mesh does
   * it make sense to model the situation in a way that uses a delta
   * function with the same overall force or sensitivity. On the other
   * hand, a situation that is probably more fruitfully simulated with
   * a delta function is the electric potential of a point source; in
   * this case, the solution is known to have a logarithmic
   * singularity (in 2d) or a $\frac{1}{r}$ singularity (in 3d),
   * neither of which is bounded.
   *
   * Mathematically, the use of delta functions typically leads to exact
   * solutions to which the numerically obtained, approximate solution does
   * not converge. This is because, taking the Laplace equation as an example,
   * the error between exact and numerical solution can be bounded by the
   * expression
   * @f{align*}{
   *   \| u-u_h \|_{L_2} \le C h \| \nabla u \|_{L_2}
   * @f}
   * but when using a delta function on the right hand side, the term
   * $\| \nabla u \|_{L_2} = |u|_{H^1}$ is not finite. This can be seen
   * by using the a-priori bound for solutions of the Laplace equation
   * $-\Delta u = f$ that states that $|u|_{H^1} \le \|f\|_{H^{-1}}$.
   * When using a delta function as right hand side, $f(x)=\delta(x-p)$,
   * one would need to take the $H^{-1}$ norm of a delta function, which
   * however is not finite because $\delta(\cdot-p) \not\in H^{-1}$.
   *
   * The consequence of all of this is that the exact solution of the
   * Laplace equation with a delta function on the right hand side --
   * i.e., the <i>Green's function</i> -- has a singularity at $p$ that
   * is so strong that it cannot be resolved by a finite element
   * solution, and consequently finite element approximations do not
   * converge towards the exact solution in any of the usual norms.
   *
   * All of this is also the case for all of the other usual second-order
   * partial differential equations in dimensions two or higher. (Because
   * in dimension two and higher, $H^1$ functions are not necessarily
   * continuous, and consequently the delta function is not in the dual
   * space $H^{-1}$.)
