/**
 * A namespace for data structures that are going to be passed from
 * DataOut to the member functions of DataPostprocessor.
 */
namespace DataPostprocessorInputs
{
  /**
   * A base class containing common elements for the Scalar and Vector classes
   * that are passed as arguments to
   * DataPostprocessor::evaluate_scalar_field() and
   * DataPostprocessor::evaluate_vector_field(). This common base class
   * provides access to the points at which the solution is being evaluated,
   * and a few other fields, as described in the following.
   *
   * <h4>Normal vector access</h4>
   *
   * If appropriate, i.e., if the object that is currently being processed
   * is a face of a cell and the DataPostprocessor object is called from
   * DataOutFaces or a similar class, then the current object also
   * stores the normal vectors to the geometry on which output
   * is generated, at these evaluation points.
   *
   * On the other hand, if the solution is being evaluated on a cell,
   * then the @p normal_vectors member variable does not contain anything
   * useful.
   *
   * <h4>Cell access</h4>
   *
   * DataPostprocessor is typically called from classes such as DataOut
   * or DataOutFaces that evaluate solution fields on a cell-by-cell
   * basis. As a consequence, classes derived from DataPostprocessor
   * (or DataPostprocessorScalar, DataPostprocessorVector, or
   * DataPostprocessorTensor) sometimes
   * need to use which cell is currently under investigation. Consequently,
   * DataOut and similar classes pass the cell they are currently working
   * on to DataPostprocessor via the classes in this namespace (and
   * specifically the current base class).
   *
   * However, the situation is not so simple. This is because the current
   * class (and those derived from it) only knows the space dimension in
   * which the output lives. But this can come from many sources. For example,
   * if we are in 3d, this may be because we are working on a DoFHandler<3> or
   * a DoFHandler<2,3> (i.e., either a 3d mesh, or a 2d meshes of a 2d surface
   * embedded in 3d space). Another case is classes like DataOutRotation or
   * DataOutStack, then @p spacedim being equal to 3 might mean that we are
   * actually working on a DoFHandler<2>.
   *
   * In other words, just because we know the value of the @p spacedim
   * template argument of the current class does not mean that the
   * data type of the cell iterator that is currently being worked on
   * is obvious.
   *
   * To make the cell iterator accessible nevertheless, this class uses
   * an object of type boost::any to store the cell iterator. You can
   * think of this as being a void pointer that can point to anything.
   * To use what is being used therefore requires the user to know the
   * data type of the thing being pointed to.
   *
   * To make this work, the DataOut and related classes store in objects
   * of the current type a representation of the cell. To get it back out,
   * you would use the get_cell() function that requires you to say,
   * as a template parameter, the dimension of the cell that is currently
   * being processed. This is knowledge you typically have in an
   * application: for example, if your application runs in @p dim space
   * dimensions and you are currently using the DataOut class, then the cells
   * that are worked on have data type <code>DataOut<dim>::cell_iterator</code>.
   * Consequently, in a postprocessor, you can call <code>inputs.get_cell@<dim@>
   * </code>. For technical reasons, however, C++ will typically require you to
   * write this as <code>inputs.template get_cell@<dim@> </code> because the
   * member function we call here requires that we explicitly provide the
   * template argument.
   *
   * Let us consider a complete example of a postprocessor that computes
   * the fluid norm of the stress $\|\sigma\| = \|\eta \nabla u\|$ from the
   * viscosity $\eta$ and the gradient of the fluid velocity, $\nabla u$,
   * assuming that the viscosity is something that depends on the cell's
   * material id. This can be done using a class we derive from
   * DataPostprocessorScalar where we overload the
   * DataPostprocessor::evaluate_vector_field() function that receives the
   * values and gradients of the velocity (plus of other solution variables such
   * as the pressure, but let's ignore those for the moment). Then we could use
   * code such as this:
   * @code
   *   template <int dim>
   *   class ComputeStress : public DataPostprocessorScalar<dim>
   *   {
   *     public:
   *       ... // overload other necessary member variables
   *       virtual
   *       void
   *       evaluate_vector_field
   *       (const DataPostprocessorInputs::Vector<dim> &input_data,
   *        std::vector<Vector<double> > &computed_quantities) const override
   *       {
   *         const typename DoFHandler<dim>::cell_iterator current_cell =
   *           input_data.template get_cell<dim>();
   *         const viscosity = look_up_viscosity (current_cell->material_id());
   *
   *         for (unsigned int q=0; q<input_data.solution_gradients.size(); ++q)
   *           computed_quantities[q][0] =
   *             (viscosity * input_data.solution_gradients[q]).norm();
   *       }
   *   };
   * @endcode

/**
 * This class provides an interface to compute derived quantities from a
 * solution that can then be output in graphical formats for visualization,
 * using facilities such as the DataOut class.
 *
 * For the (graphical) output of a FE solution one frequently wants to include
 * derived quantities, which are calculated from the values of the solution
 * and possibly the first and second derivatives of the solution. Examples are
 * the calculation of Mach numbers from velocity and density in supersonic
 * flow computations, or the computation of the magnitude of a complex-valued
 * solution as demonstrated in step-29 and step-58 (where it is actually
 * the *square* of the magnitude). Other uses are shown in
 * step-32 and step-33. This class offers the interface to perform such
 * postprocessing. Given the values and derivatives of the solution at those
 * points where we want to generated output, the functions of this class can be
 * overloaded to compute new quantities.
 *
 * A data vector and an object of a class derived from the current one can be
 * given to the DataOut::add_data_vector() function (and similarly for
 * DataOutRotation and DataOutFaces). This will cause DataOut::build_patches()
 * to compute the derived quantities instead of using the data provided by the
 * data vector (typically the solution vector). Note that the
 * DataPostprocessor object (i.e., in reality the object of your derived
 * class) has to live until the DataOut object is destroyed as the latter
 * keeps a pointer to the former and will complain if the object pointed to is
 * destroyed while the latter still has a pointer to it. If both the data
 * postprocessor and DataOut objects are local variables of a function (as
 * they are, for example, in step-29), then you can avoid this error by
 * declaring the data postprocessor variable before the DataOut variable as
 * objects are destroyed in reverse order of declaration.
 *
 * In order not to perform needless calculations, DataPostprocessor has to
 * provide information which input data is needed for the calculation of the
 * derived quantities, i.e. whether it needs the values, the first derivative
 * and/or the second derivative of the provided data. DataPostprocessor
 * objects which are used in combination with a DataOutFaces object can also
 * ask for the normal vectors at each point. The information which data is
 * needed has to be provided via the UpdateFlags returned by the virtual
 * function get_needed_update_flags(). It is your responsibility to use only
 * those values which were updated in the calculation of derived quantities.
 * The DataOut object will provide references to the requested data in the
 * call to evaluate_scalar_field() or
 * evaluate_vector_field() (DataOut decides which of the two
 * functions to call depending on whether the finite element in use has only a
 * single, or multiple vector components; note that this is only determined by
 * the number of components in the finite element in use, and not by whether
 * the data computed by a class derived from the current one is scalar or
 * vector valued).
 *
 * Furthermore, derived classes have to implement the get_names() function,
 * where the number of output variables returned by the latter function has to
 * match the size of the vector returned by the former. Furthermore, this
 * number has to match the number of computed quantities, of course.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Use in simpler cases</h3>
 *
 * Deriving from the current class allows to implement very general
 * postprocessors. For example, in the step-32 program, we implement a
 * postprocessor that takes a solution that consists of velocity, pressure and
 * temperature (dim+2 components) and computes a variety of output quantities,
 * some of which are vector valued and some of which are scalar. On the other
 * hand, in step-29 we implement a postprocessor that only computes the
 * magnitude of a complex number given by a two-component finite element. It
 * seems silly to have to implement four virtual functions for this
 * (evaluate_scalar_field() or evaluate_vector_field(), get_names(),
 * get_update_flags() and get_data_component_interpretation()).
 *
 * To this end there are three classes DataPostprocessorScalar,
 * DataPostprocessorVector, and DataPostprocessorTensor that are meant to be
 * used if the output quantity is either a single scalar, a single vector
 * (here used meaning to have exactly @p dim components), or a single
 * tensor (here used meaning to have exactly <code>dim*dim</code> components).
 * When using these classes, one only has to write a
 * constructor that passes the name of the output variable and the update
 * flags to the constructor of the base class and overload the function that
 * actually computes the results.
 *
 * The DataPostprocessorVector and DataPostprocessorTensor class documentations
 * also contains a extensive examples of how they can be used. The step-29
 * tutorial program contains an example of using the DataPostprocessorScalar
 * class.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Complex-valued solutions</h3>
 *
 * There are PDEs whose solutions are complex-valued. For example, step-58 and
 * step-62 solve problems whose solutions at each point consists of a complex
 * number represented by a `std::complex<double>` variable. (step-29 also solves
 * such a problem, but there we choose to represent the solution by two
 * real-valued fields.) In such cases, the vector that is handed to
 * DataOut::build_patches() is of type `Vector<std::complex<double>>`, or
 * something essentially equivalent to this. The issue with this, as also
 * discussed in the documentation of DataOut itself, is that the most widely
 * used file formats for visualization (notably, the VTK and VTU formats)
 * can not actually represent complex quantities. The only thing
 * that can be stored in these data files are real-valued quantities.
 *
 * As a consequence, DataOut is forced to take things apart into their real
 * and imaginary parts, and both are output as separate quantities. This is the
 * case for data that is written directly to a file by DataOut, but it is also
 * the case for data that is first routed through DataPostprocessor objects
 * (or objects of their derived classes): All these objects see is a collection
 * of real values, even if the underlying solution vector was complex-valued.
 *
 * All of this has two implications:
 * - If a solution vector is complex-valued, then this results in at least
 *   two input components at each evaluation point. As a consequence, the
 *   DataPostprocessor::evaluate_scalar_field() function is never called,
 *   even if the underlying finite element had only a single solution
 *   component. Instead, DataOut will *always* call
 *   DataPostprocessor::evaluate_vector_field().
 * - Implementations of the DataPostprocessor::evaluate_vector_field() in
 *   derived classes must understand how the solution values are arranged
 *   in the DataPostprocessorInputs::Vector objects they receive as input.
 *   The rule here is: If the finite element has $N$ vector components
 *   (including the case $N=1$, i.e., a scalar element), then the inputs
 *   for complex-valued solution vectors will have $2N$ components. These
 *   first contain the values (or gradients, or Hessians) of the real
 *   parts of all solution components, and then the values (or gradients,
 *   or Hessians) of the imaginary parts of all solution components.
 *
 * step-58 provides an example of how this class (or, rather, the derived
 * DataPostprocessorScalar class) is used in a complex-valued situation.

 *
 *
 * <h3> An example </h3>
 *
 * A common example of what one wants to do with postprocessors is to visualize
 * not just the value of the solution, but the gradient. This is, in fact,
 * precisely what step-19 needs, and it consequently uses the code below almost
 * verbatim. Let's, for simplicity,
 * assume that you have only a scalar solution. In fact, because it's readily
 * available, let us simply take the step-6 solver to produce such a scalar
 * solution. The gradient is a vector (with exactly @p dim components), so the
 * current class fits the bill to produce the gradient through postprocessing.
 * Then, the following code snippet implements everything you need to have
 * to visualize the gradient:
 * @code
 * template <int dim>
 * class GradientPostprocessor : public DataPostprocessorVector<dim>
 * {
 * public:
 *   GradientPostprocessor ()
 *     :
 *     // call the constructor of the base class. call the variable to
 *     // be output "grad_u" and make sure that DataOut provides us
 *     // with the gradients:
 *     DataPostprocessorVector<dim> ("grad_u",
 *                                   update_gradients)
 *   {}
 *
 *   virtual
 *   void
 *   evaluate_scalar_field
 *   (const DataPostprocessorInputs::Scalar<dim> &input_data,
 *    std::vector<Vector<double> > &computed_quantities) const override
 *   {
 *     // ensure that there really are as many output slots
 *     // as there are points at which DataOut provides the
 *     // gradients:
 *     AssertDimension (input_data.solution_gradients.size(),
 *                      computed_quantities.size());
 *
 *     // then loop over all of these inputs:
 *     for (unsigned int p=0; p<input_data.solution_gradients.size(); ++p)
 *       {
 *         // ensure that each output slot has exactly 'dim'
 *         // components (as should be expected, given that we
 *         // want to create vector-valued outputs), and copy the
 *         // gradients of the solution at the evaluation points
 *         // into the output slots:
 *         AssertDimension (computed_quantities[p].size(), dim);
 *         for (unsigned int d=0; d<dim; ++d)
 *           computed_quantities[p][d]
 *             = input_data.solution_gradients[p][d];
 *       }
 *   }
 * };
 * @endcode
 * The only thing that is necessary is to add another output to the call
 * of DataOut::add_vector() in the @p run() function of the @p Step6 class
 * of that example program. The corresponding code snippet would then look
 * like this (where we also use VTU as the file format to output the data):
 * @code
 *   GradientPostprocessor<dim> gradient_postprocessor;
 *
 *   DataOut<dim> data_out;
 *   data_out.attach_dof_handler (dof_handler);
 *   data_out.add_data_vector (solution, "solution");
 *   data_out.add_data_vector (solution, gradient_postprocessor);
 *   data_out.build_patches ();
 *
 *   std::ofstream output ("solution.vtu");
 *   data_out.write_vtu (output);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This leads to the following output for the solution and the
 * gradients (you may want to compare with the solution shown in the results
 * section of step-6; the current data is generated on a coarser mesh for
 * simplicity):
 *
 * @image html data_postprocessor_vector_0.png
 * @image html data_postprocessor_vector_1.png
 *
 * In the second image, the background color corresponds to the magnitude of the
 * gradient vector and the vector glyphs to the gradient itself. It may be
 * surprising at first to see that from each vertex, multiple vectors originate,
 * going in different directions. But that is because the solution is only
 * continuous: in general, the gradient is discontinuous across edges, and so
 * the multiple vectors originating from each vertex simply represent the
 * differing gradients of the solution at each adjacent cell.
 *
 * The output above -- namely, the gradient $\nabla u$ of the solution --
 * corresponds to the temperature gradient if one interpreted step-6 as solving
 * a steady-state heat transfer problem.
 * It is very small in the central part of the domain because in step-6 we are
 * solving an equation that has a coefficient $a(\mathbf x)$ that is large in
 * the central part and small on the outside. This can be thought as a material
 * that conducts heat well, and consequently the temperature gradient is small.
 * On the other hand, the "heat flux" corresponds to the quantity
 * $a(\mathbf x) \nabla u(\mathbf x)$. For the
 * solution of that equation, the flux should be continuous across the
 * interface. This is easily verified by the following modification of the
 * postprocessor:
 * @code
 * template <int dim>
 * class HeatFluxPostprocessor : public DataPostprocessorVector<dim>
 * {
 * public:
 *   HeatFluxPostprocessor ()
 *     :
 *     // like above, but now also make sure that DataOut provides
 *     // us with coordinates of the evaluation points:
 *     DataPostprocessorVector<dim> ("heat_flux",
 *                                   update_gradients | update_quadrature_points)
 *   {}
 *
 *   virtual
 *   void
 *   evaluate_scalar_field
 *   (const DataPostprocessorInputs::Scalar<dim> &input_data,
 *    std::vector<Vector<double> > &computed_quantities) const override
 *   {
 *     AssertDimension (input_data.solution_gradients.size(),
 *                      computed_quantities.size());
 *
 *     for (unsigned int p=0; p<input_data.solution_gradients.size(); ++p)
 *       {
 *         AssertDimension (computed_quantities[p].size(), dim);
 *         for (unsigned int d=0; d<dim; ++d)
 *           // like above, but also multiply the gradients with
 *           // the coefficient evaluated at the current point:
 *           computed_quantities[p][d]
 *             = coefficient (input_data.evaluation_points[p]) *
 *               input_data.solution_gradients[p][d];
 *       }
 *   }
 * };
 * @endcode
 * With this postprocessor, we get the following picture of the heat flux:
 *
 * @image html data_postprocessor_vector_2.png
 *
 * As the background color shows, the gradient times the coefficient is now
 * a continuous function. There are (large) vectors around the interface
 * where the coefficient jumps (at half the distance between the center of the
 * disk to the perimeter) that seem to point in the wrong direction; this is
 * an artifact of the fact that the solution has a discontinuous gradient
 * at these points and that the numerical solution on the current grid
 * does not adequately resolve this interface. This, however, is not
 * important to the current discussion.
 *
 *
 * <h3> Extension to the gradients of vector-valued problems </h3>
 *
 * The example above uses a scalar solution and its gradient as an example.
 * On the other hand, one may want to do something similar for the gradient
 * of a vector-valued displacement field (such as the strain or
 * stress of a displacement field, like those computed in step-8, step-17,
 * step-18, or step-44). In that case, the solution is already vector
 * valued and the stress is a (symmetric) tensor.
 *
 * deal.II does not currently support outputting tensor-valued quantities, but
 * they can of course be output as a collection of scalar-valued components of
 * the tensor. This can be facilitated using the DataPostprocessorTensor
 * class. The documentation of that class contains an example.

 *
 * For this case, we would like to output all of these components as parts

 *
 * (In order to visualize this collection of scalar fields that, together,

 * {grad_u_yx, grad_u_yy}}</code>, where the referenced variables are
 * the names of scalar fields that, here, are produced by the example
 * below. VisIt is then able to visualize this "new" variable as a
 * tensor.)
 *
 * All derived classes have to do is implement a constructor and overload
 * either DataPostprocessor::evaluate_scalar_field() or
 * DataPostprocessor::evaluate_vector_field() as discussed in the
 * DataPostprocessor class's documentation.
 *
 * An example of how the closely related class DataPostprocessorScalar is used

 *
 *
 * <h3> An example </h3>
 *
 * A common example of what one wants to do with postprocessors is to visualize
 * not just the value of the solution, but the gradient. This class is meant for
 * tensor-valued outputs, so we will start with a vector-valued solution: the
 * displacement field of step-8. The gradient is a rank-2 tensor (with exactly
 * <code>dim*dim</code> components), so the
 * current class fits the bill to produce the gradient through postprocessing.
 * Then, the following code snippet implements everything you need to have
 * to visualize the gradient:
 * @code
 *   template <int dim>
 *   class GradientPostprocessor : public DataPostprocessorTensor<dim>
 *   {
 *   public:
 *     GradientPostprocessor ()
 *       :
 *       DataPostprocessorTensor<dim> ("grad_u",
 *                                     update_gradients)
 *     {}
 *
 *     virtual
 *     void
 *     evaluate_vector_field
 *     (const DataPostprocessorInputs::Vector<dim> &input_data,
 *      std::vector<Vector<double> > &computed_quantities) const override
 *     {
 *       // ensure that there really are as many output slots
 *       // as there are points at which DataOut provides the
 *       // gradients:
 *       AssertDimension (input_data.solution_gradients.size(),
 *                        computed_quantities.size());
 *
 *       for (unsigned int p=0; p<input_data.solution_gradients.size(); ++p)
 *         {
 *           // ensure that each output slot has exactly 'dim*dim'
 *           // components (as should be expected, given that we
 *           // want to create tensor-valued outputs), and copy the
 *           // gradients of the solution at the evaluation points
 *           // into the output slots:
 *           AssertDimension (computed_quantities[p].size(),
 *                            (Tensor<2,dim>::n_independent_components));
 *           for (unsigned int d=0; d<dim; ++d)
 *             for (unsigned int e=0; e<dim; ++e)
 *               computed_quantities[p][Tensor<2,dim>::component_to_unrolled_index(TableIndices<2>(d,e))]
 *                 = input_data.solution_gradients[p][d][e];
 *         }
 *     }
 *   };
 * @endcode
 * The only tricky part in this piece of code is how to sort the
 * <code>dim*dim</code> elements of the strain tensor into the one vector of
 * computed output quantities -- in other words, how to <i>unroll</i> the
 * elements of the tensor into the vector. This is facilitated by the
 * Tensor::component_to_unrolled_index() function that takes a
 * pair of indices that specify a particular element of the
 * tensor and returns a vector index that is then used in the code
 * above to fill the @p computed_quantities array.
 *
 * The last thing that is necessary is to add another output to the call
 * of DataOut::add_vector() in the @p output_results() function of the @p Step8
 * class of that example program. The corresponding code snippet would then look
 * like this:
 * @code
 *     GradientPostprocessor<dim> grad_u;
 *
 *     DataOut<dim> data_out;
 *     data_out.attach_dof_handler (dof_handler);
 *
 *     std::vector<DataComponentInterpretation::DataComponentInterpretation>
 *     data_component_interpretation
 *     (dim, DataComponentInterpretation::component_is_part_of_vector);
 *     data_out.add_data_vector (solution,
 *                               std::vector<std::string>(dim,"displacement"),
 *                               DataOut<dim>::type_dof_data,
 *                               data_component_interpretation);
 *     data_out.add_data_vector (solution, grad_u);
 *     data_out.build_patches ();
 *     data_out.write_vtk (output);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This leads to the following output for the displacement field (i.e., the
 * solution) and the gradients (you may want to compare with the solution shown
 * in the results section of step-8; the current data is generated on a uniform
 * mesh for simplicity):
 *
 * @image html data_postprocessor_tensor_0.png
 * @image html data_postprocessor_tensor_1.png
 *
 * These pictures show an ellipse representing the gradient tensor at, on
 * average, every tenth mesh point. You may want to read through the
 * documentation of the VisIt visualization program (see
 * https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/) for an interpretation
 * of how exactly tensors are visualizated.
 *
 * In elasticity, one is often interested not in the gradient of the
 * displacement, but in the "strain", i.e., the symmetrized version of the
 * gradient
 * $\varepsilon=\frac 12 (\nabla u + \nabla u^T)$. This is easily facilitated
 * with the following minor modification:
 * @code
 *   template <int dim>
 *   class StrainPostprocessor : public DataPostprocessorTensor<dim>
 *   {
 *   public:
 *     StrainPostprocessor ()

 *     {}
 *
 *     virtual
 *     void
 *     evaluate_vector_field
 *     (const DataPostprocessorInputs::Vector<dim> &input_data,
 *      std::vector<Vector<double> > &computed_quantities) const override
 *     {
 *       AssertDimension (input_data.solution_gradients.size(),
 *                        computed_quantities.size());
 *
 *       for (unsigned int p=0; p<input_data.solution_gradients.size(); ++p)
 *         {
 *           AssertDimension (computed_quantities[p].size(),
 *                            (Tensor<2,dim>::n_independent_components));
 *           for (unsigned int d=0; d<dim; ++d)
 *             for (unsigned int e=0; e<dim; ++e)
 *               computed_quantities[p][Tensor<2,dim>::component_to_unrolled_index(TableIndices<2>(d,e))]
 *                 = (input_data.solution_gradients[p][d][e]

 *         }
 *     }
 *   };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Using this class in step-8 leads to the following visualization:
 *
 * @image html data_postprocessor_tensor_2.png
 *
 * Given how easy it is to output the strain, it would also not be very
 * complicated to write a postprocessor that computes the <i>stress</i>
 * in the solution field as the stress is easily computed from the
 * strain by multiplication with either the strain-stress tensor or,
 * in simple cases, the Lam&eacute; constants.
