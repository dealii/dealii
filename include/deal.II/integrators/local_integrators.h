/**
 * @brief Library of integrals over cells and faces
 *
 * This namespace contains application specific local integrals for bilinear
 * forms, forms and error estimates. It is a collection of functions organized
 * into namespaces devoted to certain applications. For instance, the
 * namespace Laplace contains functions for computing cell matrices and cell
 * residuals for the Laplacian operator, as well as functions for the weak
 * boundary conditions by Nitsche or the interior penalty discontinuous
 * Galerkin method. The namespace Maxwell does the same for curl-curl type
 * problems.
 *
 * The namespace L2 contains functions for mass matrices and
 * <i>L<sup>2</sup></i>-inner products.
 *
 * <h3>Notational conventions</h3>
 *
 * In most cases, the action of a function in this namespace can be described
 * by a single integral. We distinguish between integrals over cells <i>Z</i>
 * and over faces <i>F</i>. If an integral is denoted as
 * @f[
 *   \int_Z u \otimes v \,dx,
 * @f]
 * it will yield the following results, depending on the type of operation
 * <ul>
 * <li> If the function returns a matrix, the entry at position <i>(i,j)</i>
 * will be the integrated product of test function <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> and
 * trial function <i>u<sub>j</sub></i> (note the reversion of indices)</li>
 * <li> If the function returns a vector, then the vector entry at position
 * <i>i</i> will be the integrated product of the given function <i>u</i> with
 * the test function <i>v<sub>i</sub></i>.</li>
 * <li> If the function returns a number, then this number is the integral of
 * the two given functions <i>u</i> and <i>v</i>.
 * </ul>
 *
 * We will use regular cursive symbols $u$ for scalars and bold symbols
 * $\mathbf u$ for vectors. Test functions are always <i>v</i> and trial
 * functions are always <i>u</i>. Parameters are Greek and the face normal
 * vectors are $\mathbf n = \mathbf n_1 = -\mathbf n_2$.
 *
 * <h3>Signature of functions</h3>
 *
 * Functions in this namespace follow a generic signature. In the simplest
 * case, you have two related functions
 * @code
 *   template <int dim>
 *   void
 *   cell_matrix (
 *     FullMatrix<double>& M,
 *     const FEValuesBase<dim>& fe,
 *     const double factor = 1.);
 *
 *   template <int dim>
 *   void
 *   cell_residual (
 *     BlockVector<double>* v,
 *     const FEValuesBase<dim>& fe,
 *     const std::vector<Tensor<1,dim> >& input,
 *     const double factor = 1.);
 * @endcode
 *
 * There is typically a pair of functions for the same operator, the function
 * <tt>cell_residual</tt> implementing the mapping of the operator from the
 * finite element space into its dual, and the function <tt>cell_matrix</tt>
 * generating the bilinear form corresponding to the Frechet derivative of
 * <tt>cell_residual</tt>.
 *
 * The first argument of these functions is the return type, which is
 * <ul>
 * <li> FullMatrix&lt;double&gt; for matrices
 * <li> BlockVector&ltdouble&gt; for vectors
 * </ul>
 *
 * The next argument is the FEValuesBase object representing the finite
 * element for integration. If the integrated operator maps from one finite
 * element space into the dual of another (for instance an off-diagonal matrix
 * in a block system), then first the FEValuesBase for the trial space and
 * after this the one for the test space are specified.
 *
 * This list is followed by the set of required data in the order
 * <ol>
 * <li> Data vectors from finite element functions
 * <li> Data vectors from other objects
 * <li> Additional data
 * <li> A factor which is multiplied with the whole result
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * The local integrators can be used wherever a local integration loop would
 * have been implemented instead. The following example is from the
 * implementation of a Stokes solver, using
 * MeshWorker::Assembler::LocalBlocksToGlobalBlocks. The matrices are
 * <ul>
 * <li> 0: The vector Laplacian for the velocity (here with a vector valued
 * element)
 * <li> 1: The divergence matrix
 * <li> 2: The pressure mass matrix used in the preconditioner
 * </ul>
 *
 * With these matrices, the function called by MeshWorker::loop() could be
 * written like
 * @code
 * using namespace ::dealii:: LocalIntegrators;
 *
 * template <int dim>
 * void MatrixIntegrator<dim>::cell(
 * MeshWorker::DoFInfo<dim>& dinfo,
 * typename MeshWorker::IntegrationInfo<dim>& info)
 * {
 * Laplace::cell_matrix(dinfo.matrix(0,false).matrix, info.fe_values(0));
 * Divergence::cell_matrix(dinfo.matrix(1,false).matrix, info.fe_values(0), info.fe_values(1));
 * L2::cell_matrix(dinfo.matrix(2,false).matrix, info.fe_values(1));
 * }
 * @endcode
 * See step-39 for a worked out example of this code.
 *
 * @ingroup Integrators
