/**
 * Base class used to declare the operations needed by a concrete class
 * implementing prolongation and restriction of vectors in the multigrid
 * context. This class is abstract and has no implementation of these
 * operations.
 *
 * There are several derived classes, reflecting the fact that vector types
 * and numbering of the fine-grid discretization and of the multi-level
 * implementation are independent.
 *
 * If you use multigrid for a single PDF or for your complete system of
 * equations, you will use MGTransferPrebuilt together with Multigrid. The
 * vector types used on the fine grid as well as for the multilevel operations
 * may be Vector or BlockVector. In both cases, MGTransferPrebuilt will
 * operate on all components of the solution.
 *
 * @note For the following, it is important to realize the difference between
 * a solution
 * @ref GlossComponent "component"
 * and a solution
 * @ref GlossBlock "block".
 * The distinction only applies if vector valued elements are used, but is
 * quite important then. This is reflected in the fact that it is not possible
 * right now to use transfer classes based on MGTransferComponentBase for
 * genuine vector valued elements, but descendants of MGTransferBlockBase
 * would have to be applied. In the following text, we will use the term
 * <em>block</em>, but remark that it might refer to components as well.
 *
 * @todo update the following documentation, since it does not reflect the
 * latest changes in structure.
 *
 * For mixed systems, it may be required to do multigrid only for a single
 * component or for some components. The classes MGTransferSelect and
 * MGTransferBlock handle these cases.
 *
 * MGTransferSelect is used if you use mutligrid (on Vector objects) for a
 * single component, possibly grouped using <tt>mg_target_component</tt>.
 *
 * The class MGTransferBlock handles the case where your multigrid method
 * operates on BlockVector objects. These can contain all or a consecutive set
 * of the blocks of the complete system. Since most smoothers cannot operate
 * on block structures, it is not clear whether this case is really useful.
 * Therefore, a tested implementation of this case will be supplied when
 * needed.
