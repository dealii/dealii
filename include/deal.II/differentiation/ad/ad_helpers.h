    /**
     * A base helper class that facilitates the evaluation of the derivative(s)
     * of a number of user-defined dependent variables $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{X})$
     * with respect to a set of independent variables $\mathbf{X}$, that is
     * $\dfrac{d^{i} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{X})}{d \mathbf{X}^{i}}$.
     *
     * This class is templated on the floating point type @p scalar_type of the
     * number that we'd like to differentiate, as well as an enumeration
     * indicating the @p ADNumberTypeCode . The @p ADNumberTypeCode dictates
     * which auto-differentiation library is to be used, and what the nature of
     * the underlying auto-differentiable number is. Refer to the
     * @ref auto_symb_diff module for more details in this regard.
     *
     * For all of the classes derived from this base class, there are two
     * possible ways that the code in which they are used can be structured.
     * The one approach is effectively a subset of the other, and which might
     * be necessary to use depends on the nature of the chosen
     * auto-differentiable number.
     *
     * When "tapeless" numbers are employed, the most simple code structure
     * would be of the following form:
     *
     * @code
     *   // Initialize AD helper
     *   ADHelperType<tapeless_AD_typecode> ad_helper (...);
     *
     *   // Register independent variables
     *   ad_helper.register_independent_variable(...);
     *
     *   // Extract the sensitive equivalent of the independent variables.
     *   // They are the auto-differentiable counterparts to the values
     *   // used as arguments to the register_independent_variable() function.
     *   // The operations conducted with these AD numbers will be tracked.
     *   const auto ad_independent_variables
     *     = ad_helper.get_sensitive_variables(...);
     *
     *   // Use the sensitive variables to compute the dependent variables.
     *   const auto ad_dependent_variables = func(sensitive_variables);
     *
     *   // Register the dependent variables with the helper class
     *   ad_helper.register_dependent_variables(ad_dependent_variables);
     *
     *   // Compute derivatives of the dependent variables
     *   const auto derivatives = ad_helper.compute_gradients();
     * @endcode
     *
     * Note that since the specialized classes interpret the independent
     * variables in different ways, above represents only an outline of the
     * steps taken to compute derivatives. More specific examples are outlined
     * in the individual classes that specialize this base class.
     *
     * When "taped" numbers are to be used, the above code should be wrapped by
     * a few more lines of code to manage the taping procedure:
     *
     * @code
     *   // Initialize AD helper
     *   ADHelperType<taped_or_tapeless_AD_typecode> ad_helper (...);
     *
     *   // An optional call to set the amount of memory to be allocated to
     *   // storing taped data
     *   ad_helper.set_tape_buffer_sizes();
     *
     *    // Select a tape number to record to
     *   const typename Types<ad_type>::tape_index  tape_index = ...;
     *
     *   // Indicate that we are about to start tracing the operations for
     *   // function evaluation on the tape. If this tape has already been used
     *   // (i.e. the operations are already recorded) then we (optionally)
     *   // load the tape and reuse this data.
     *   const bool is_recording
     *     = ad_helper.start_recording_operations(tape_index);
     *   if (is_recording == true)
     *   {
     *     // This is the "recording" phase of the operations.
     *     // In this block one places the majority of the operations described
     *     // in the previous code block. The set of operations that are
     *     // conducted here therefore includes the following steps:
     *     // - Register independent variables
     *     // - Extract the sensitive equivalent of the independent variables
     *     // - Use the sensitive variables to compute the dependent variables
     *     // - Register the dependent variables with the helper class
     *
     *     // Indicate that have completed tracing the operations onto the tape.
     *     ad_helper.stop_recording_operations(false); // write_tapes_to_file
     *   }
     *   else
     *   {
     *     // This is the "tape reuse" phase of the operations.
     *     // Here we will leverage the already traced operations that reside
     *     // on a tape, and simply revaluate the tape at a different point
     *     // to get the function values and their derivatives.
     *
     *     // Load the existing tape to be reused
     *     ad_helper.activate_recorded_tape(tape_no);
     *
     *     // Set the new values of the independent variables where the recorded
     *     // dependent functions are to be evaluated (and differentiated
     *     // around).
     *     ad_helper.set_independent_variable(...);
     *   }
     *
     *   // Compute derivatives of the dependent variables
     *   const auto derivatives = ad_helper.compute_gradients();
     * @endcode
     *
     * The second approach outlined here is more general than the first, and
     * will work equally well for both taped and tapeless auto-differentiable
     * numbers.
     *
     * @warning ADOL-C does not support the standard threading models used by
     * deal.II, so this class should @b not be embedded within a multithreaded
     * function when using ADOL-C number types. It is, however, suitable for use
     * in both serial and MPI routines.
     *
     * @todo Make this class thread safe for Sacado number and ADOL-C tapeless
     * numbers (if supported).

    /**
     * A general helper class that facilitates the evaluation of a vector of
     * functions, as well as its first derivatives (their Jacobian).
     * This class would typically be used to compute the linearization of a
     * set of local nonlinear equations, but can also be used as the basis of
     * the linearization of the residual vector defined on the level of a finite
     * element (for example, in order to compute the Jacobian matrix necessary
     * in Newton-type solvers for nonlinear problems).
     *
     * @note When using the cell-level taped AD methods in 3d and/or with higher
     * order elements, it is incredibly easy to exceed the tape buffer size.
     * The reason for this is two-fold:
     *   1. there are many independent variables (the local
     *      degrees-of-freedom) to take the derivatives with respect to, and
     *   2. the expressions for the dependent variables (each being a component
     *      of the residual vector) in terms of all of the independent variables
     *      are lengthy, especially when non-trivial constitutive laws are
     *      considered.
     * These buffer variables dictate the amount of memory allocated to a tape
     * before it is written to file (at a significant performance loss).
     * Therefore for ADOL-C taped AD numbers, it may be desirable to
     * create a file ".adolcrc" in the program run directory and set the buffer
     * size therein (as is suggested by the ADOL-C manual). For example, the
     * following settings increase the default buffer size by 128 times:
     * @code
     * "OBUFSIZE" "67108864"
     * "LBUFSIZE" "67108864"
     * "VBUFSIZE" "67108864"
     * "TBUFSIZE" "67108864"
     * @endcode
     * Note that the quotation marks are mandatory.
     * An alternative approach that allows for run-time decision making is to
     * use the HelperBase::set_tape_buffer_sizes() function before starting
     * taping (as done via the HelperBase::start_recording_operations()
     * function).
     *
     * @warning ADOL-C does not support the standard threading models used by
     * deal.II, so this class should @b not be embedded within a multithreaded
     * function when using ADOL-C number types. It is, however, suitable for use
     * in both serial and MPI routines.
