     * The class that stores the indices of the degrees of freedom for all the
     * cells. Essentially, this is a smart number cache in the style of a
     * DoFHandler that also embeds the description of constraints directly on
     * the cell level without the need to refer to the external
     * ConstraintMatrix.
     *
     * This class only stores index relations. The weights for hanging node
     * constraints are stored in a different field. This is because a
     * different field allows for the same compressed weight data on different
     * DoFHandlers for vector-valued problems. There, the indices might be
     * constrained differently on different components (e.g. Dirichlet
     * conditions only on selected components), whereas the weights from
     * hanging nodes are the same and need to be stored only once. The
     * combination will be handled in the MatrixFree class.
