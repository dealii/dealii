     * Structure for storing degree of freedom information for cells,
     * organized by levels.
     *
     * We store are cached values for the DoF indices on each cell
     * in#cell_dof_indices_cache, since this is a frequently requested
     * operation. The values are set by
     * DoFCellAccessor::update_cell_dof_indices_cache and are used by
     * DoFCellAccessor::get_dof_indices.
     *
     * Note that vertices are separate from, and in fact have nothing to do
     * with cells. The indices of degrees of freedom located on vertices
     * therefore are not stored here, but rather in member variables of the
     * dealii::DoFHandler class.
     *
     * The indices of degrees of freedom located on lower dimensional objects,
     * i.e. on lines for 2D and on quads and lines for 3D are treated
     * similarly than that on cells. However, these geometrical objects, which
     * are called faces as a generalisation, are not organised in a
     * hierarchical structure of levels. Therefore, the degrees of freedom
     * located on these objects are stored in separate classes, namely the
     * <tt>DoFFaces</tt> classes.
     *
     * Access to this object is usually through the
     * DoFAccessor::set_dof_index() and DoFAccessor::dof_index() functions or
     * similar functions of derived classes that in turn access the member
     * variables using the DoFHandler::get_dof_index() and corresponding
     * setter functions. Knowledge of the actual data format is therefore
     * encapsulated to the present hierarchy of classes as well as the
     * dealii::DoFHandler class.
