/**
 * Given a triangulation and a description of a finite element, this
 * class enumerates degrees of freedom on all vertices, edges, faces,
 * and cells of the triangulation. As a result, it also provides a
 * <i>basis</i> for a discrete space $V_h$ whose elements are finite
 * element functions defined on each cell by a FiniteElement object.
 * This class satisfies the
 * @ref ConceptMeshType "MeshType concept"
 * requirements.
 *
 * It is first used in the step-2 tutorial program.
 *
 * For each vertex, line, quad, etc, this class stores a list of the indices
 * of degrees of freedom living on this object. These indices refer to the
 * unconstrained degrees of freedom, i.e. constrained degrees of freedom are
 * numbered in the same way as unconstrained ones, and are only later
 * eliminated.  This leads to the fact that indices in global vectors and
 * matrices also refer to all degrees of freedom and some kind of condensation
 * is needed to restrict the systems of equations to the unconstrained degrees
 * of freedom only. The actual layout of storage of the indices is described
 * in the dealii::internal::DoFHandlerImplementation::DoFLevel class
 * documentation.
 *
 * The class offers iterators to traverse all cells, in much the same way as
 * the Triangulation class does. Using the begin() and end() functions (and
 * companions, like begin_active()), one can obtain iterators to walk over
 * cells, and query the degree of freedom structures as well as the
 * triangulation data. These iterators are built on top of those of the
 * Triangulation class, but offer the additional information on degrees of
 * freedom functionality compared to pure triangulation iterators. The order
 * in which dof iterators are presented by the <tt>++</tt> and <tt>\--</tt>
 * operators is the same as that for the corresponding iterators traversing
 * the triangulation on which this DoFHandler is constructed.
 *
 * The <tt>spacedim</tt> parameter has to be used if one wants to solve
 * problems on surfaces. If not specified, this parameter takes the default
 * value <tt>=dim</tt> implying that we want to solve problems in a domain
 * whose dimension equals the dimension of the space in which it is embedded.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Distribution of indices for degrees of freedom</h3>
 *
 * The degrees of freedom (`dofs') are distributed on the given triangulation
 * by the function distribute_dofs(). It gets passed a finite element object
 * describing how many degrees of freedom are located on vertices, lines, etc.
 * It traverses the triangulation cell by cell and numbers the dofs of that
 * cell if not yet numbered. For non-multigrid algorithms, only active cells
 * are considered. Active cells are defined to be those cells which have no
 * children, i.e. they are the most refined ones.
 *
 * Since the triangulation is traversed starting with the cells of the
 * coarsest active level and going to more refined levels, the lowest numbers
 * for dofs are given to the largest cells as well as their bounding lines and
 * vertices, with the dofs of more refined cells getting higher numbers.
 *
 * This numbering implies very large bandwidths of the resulting matrices and
 * is thus vastly suboptimal for some solution algorithms. For this reason,
 * the DoFRenumbering class offers several algorithms to reorder the dof
 * numbering according. See there for a discussion of the implemented
 * algorithms.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Interaction with distributed meshes</h3>
 *
 * Upon construction, this class takes a reference to a triangulation object.
 * In most cases, this will be a reference to an object of type Triangulation,
 * i.e. the class that represents triangulations that entirely reside on a
 * single processor. However, it can also be of type
 * parallel::distributed::Triangulation (see, for example, step-32, step-40
 * and in particular the
 * @ref distributed
 * module) in which case the DoFHandler object will proceed to only manage
 * degrees of freedom on locally owned and ghost cells. This process is
 * entirely transparent to the used.
 *
 *
 * <h3>User defined renumbering schemes</h3>
 *
 * The DoFRenumbering class offers a number of renumbering schemes like the
 * Cuthill-McKee scheme. Basically, the function sets up an array in which for
 * each degree of freedom we store the new index this DoF should have after
 * renumbering. Using this array, the renumber_dofs() function of the present
 * class is called, which actually performs the change from old DoF indices to
 * the ones given in the array. In some cases, however, a user may want to
 * compute their own renumbering order; in this case, one can allocate an array
 * with one element per degree of freedom and fill it with the number that the
 * respective degree of freedom shall be assigned. This number may, for
 * example, be obtained by sorting the support points of the degrees of
 * freedom in downwind direction.  Then call the
 * <tt>renumber_dofs(vector<types::global_dof_index>)</tt> function with the
 * array, which converts old into new degree of freedom indices.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Serializing (loading or storing) DoFHandler objects</h3>
 *
 * Like many other classes in deal.II, the DoFHandler class can stream its
 * contents to an archive using BOOST's serialization facilities. The data so
 * stored can later be retrieved again from the archive to restore the
 * contents of this object. This facility is frequently used to save the state
 * of a program to disk for possible later resurrection, often in the context
 * of checkpoint/restart strategies for long running computations or on
 * computers that aren't very reliable (e.g. on very large clusters where
 * individual nodes occasionally fail and then bring down an entire MPI job).
 *
 * The model for doing so is similar for the DoFHandler class as it is for the
 * Triangulation class (see the section in the general documentation of that
 * class). In particular, the load() function does not exactly restore the
 * same state as was stored previously using the save() function. Rather, the
 * function assumes that you load data into a DoFHandler object that is
 * already associated with a triangulation that has a content that matches the
 * one that was used when the data was saved. Likewise, the load() function
 * assumes that the current object is already associated with a finite element
 * object that matches the one that was associated with it when data was
 * saved; the latter can be achieved by calling DoFHandler::distribute_dofs()
 * using the same kind of finite element before re-loading data from the
 * serialization archive.
 *
 *
 * <h3>hp-adaptive finite element methods</h3>
 *
 * Instead of only using one particular FiniteElement on all cells, this class
 * also allows for an enumeration of degrees of freedom on different finite
 * elements on every cells. To this end, one assigns an
 * <code>active_fe_index</code> to every cell that indicates which element
 * within a collection of finite elements (represented by an object of type
 * hp::FECollection) is the one that lives on this cell. The class then
 * enumerates the degree of freedom associated with these finite elements on
 * each cell of a triangulation and, if possible, identifies degrees of
 * freedom at the interfaces of cells if they match. If neighboring cells
 * have degrees of freedom along the common interface that do not immediate
 * match (for example, if you have $Q_2$ and $Q_3$ elements meeting at a
 * common face), then one needs to compute constraints to ensure that the
 * resulting finite element space on the mesh remains conforming.
 *
 * The whole process of working with objects of this type is explained in
 * step-27. Many of the algorithms this class implements are described in
 * the
 * @ref hp_paper "hp-paper".
 *
 *
 * <h3>Active FE indices and their behavior under mesh refinement</h3>
 *
 * The typical workflow for using this class is to create a mesh, assign an
 * active FE index to every active cell, call DoFHandler::distribute_dofs(),
 * and then assemble a linear system and solve a problem on this finite element
 * space.
 *
 * Active FE indices will be automatically transferred during mesh adaptation
 * from the old to the new mesh. Future FE indices are meant to determine the
 * active FE index after mesh adaptation, and are used to prepare data on the
 * old mesh for the new one. If no future FE index is specified, the finite
 * element prevails.
 *
 * In particular, the following rules apply during adaptation:
 * - Upon mesh refinement, child cells inherit the future FE index of
 *   the parent.
 * - When coarsening cells, the (now active) parent cell will be assigned
 *   a future FE index that is determined from its (no longer active)
 *   children, following the FiniteElementDomination logic: Out of the set of
 *   elements previously assigned to the former children, we choose the one
 *   dominated by all children for the parent cell. If none was found, we pick
 *   the most dominant element in the whole collection that is dominated by
 *   all former children. See hp::FECollection::find_dominated_fe_extended()
 *   for further information on this topic.
 *
 * Strategies for automatic hp-adaptation which will set future FE indices based
 * on criteria are available in the hp::Refinement namespace.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Active FE indices and parallel meshes</h3>
 *
 * When this class is used with either a parallel::shared::Triangulation
 * or a parallel::distributed::Triangulation, you can only set active
 * FE indices on cells that are locally owned,
 * using a call such as <code>cell-@>set_active_fe_index(...)</code>.
 * On the other hand, setting the active FE index on ghost
 * or artificial cells is not allowed.
 *
 * Ghost cells do acquire the information what element
 * is active on them, however: whenever you call DoFHandler::distribute_dofs(),
 * all processors that participate in the parallel mesh exchange information in
 * such a way that the active FE index on ghost cells equals the active FE index
 * that was set on that processor that owned that particular ghost cell.
 * Consequently, one can <i>query</i> the @p active_fe_index on ghost
 * cells, just not set it by hand.
 *
 * On artificial cells, no information is available about the
 * @p active_fe_index used there. That's because we don't even know
 * whether these cells exist at all, and even if they did, the
 * current processor does not know anything specific about them.
 * See
 * @ref GlossArtificialCell "the glossary entry on artificial cells"
 * for more information.
 *
 * During refinement and coarsening, information about the @p active_fe_index
 * of each cell will be automatically transferred.
 *
 * However, using a parallel::distributed::Triangulation with a DoFHandler
 * in hp-mode requires additional attention during serialization, since no
 * information on active FE indices will be automatically transferred. This
 * has to be done manually using the
 * prepare_for_serialization_of_active_fe_indices() and
 * deserialize_active_fe_indices() functions. The former has to be called
 * before parallel::distributed::Triangulation::save() is invoked, and the
 * latter needs to be run after parallel::distributed::Triangulation::load().
 * If further data will be attached to the triangulation via the
 * parallel::distributed::CellDataTransfer,
 * parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer, or Particles::ParticleHandler
 * classes, all corresponding preparation and deserialization function calls
 * need to happen in the same order. Consult the documentation of
 * parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer for more information.

   * mesh this means that the array is a list of new indices for each of the

   * freedom, enumerated in the same order as the currently locally owned
   * DoFs. In other words, assume that degree of freedom <code>i</code> is
   * currently locally owned, then
   * <code>new_numbers[locally_owned_dofs().index_within_set(i)]</code>
   * returns the new global DoF index of <code>i</code>. Since the IndexSet of
   * locally_owned_dofs() is complete in the sequential case, the latter
   * convention for the content of the array reduces to the former in the case
   * that only one processor participates in the mesh.
   *
   * @note While it follows from the above, it may be surprising to know that
   *   the <i>number</i> of locally owned degrees of freedom in a parallel
   *   computation is an invariant
   *   under renumbering, even if the <i>indices</i> associated with these
   *   locally owned degrees of freedom are not. At a fundamental level,
   *   this invariant exists because the <i>decision</i> whether a degree of
   *   freedom is locally owned or not has nothing to do with that
   *   degree of freedom's (old or new) index. Indeed, degrees of freedom
   *   are locally owned if they are on a locally owned cell and not on
   *   an interface between cells where the neighboring cell has a lower
   *   @ref GlossSubdomainId "subdomain id". Since both of these conditions
   *   are independent of the index associated with the DoF, a locally
   *   owned degree of freedom will also be locally owned after renumbering.
   *   On the other hand, properties such as whether the set of indices
   *   of locally owned DoFs forms a contiguous range or not
   *   (i.e., whether the locally_owned_dofs() returns an IndexSet object
   *   for which IndexSet::is_contiguous() returns @p true) are of
   *   course affected by the exact renumbering performed here. For example,
   *   while the initial numbering of DoF indices done in distribute_dofs()
   *   yields a contiguous numbering, the renumbering performed by
   *   DoFRenumbering::component_wise() will, in general, not yield
   *   contiguous locally owned DoF indices.
