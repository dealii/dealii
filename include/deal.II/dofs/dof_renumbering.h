/**
 * Implementation of a number of renumbering algorithms for the degrees of
 * freedom on a triangulation. The functions in this namespace compute
 * new indices for each degree of freedom of a DoFHandler object, and then call
 * DoFHandler::renumber_dofs().
 *
 *
 * <h3>Cuthill-McKee like algorithms</h3>
 *
 * Within this class, the Cuthill-McKee algorithm is implemented. It starts at
 * a degree of freedom, searches the other DoFs for those which are coupled
 * with the one we started with and numbers these in a certain way. It then
 * finds the second level of DoFs, namely those that couple with those of the
 * previous level (which were those that coupled with the initial DoF) and
 * numbers these. And so on. For the details of the algorithm, especially the
 * numbering within each level, please see H. R. Schwarz: "Methode der finiten
 * Elemente". The reverse Cuthill-McKee algorithm does the same job, but
 * numbers all elements in the reverse order.
 *
 * These algorithms have one major drawback: they require a good starting
 * point, i.e. the degree of freedom index that will get a new index of zero.
 * The renumbering functions therefore allow the caller to specify such an
 * initial DoF, e.g. by exploiting knowledge of the actual topology of the
 * domain. It is also possible to give several starting indices, which may be
 * used to simulate a simple upstream numbering (by giving the inflow dofs as
 * starting values) or to make preconditioning faster (by letting the
 * Dirichlet boundary indices be starting points).
 *
 * If no starting index is given, one is chosen automatically, namely one with
 * the smallest coordination number (the coordination number is the number of
 * other dofs this dof couples with). This dof is usually located on the
 * boundary of the domain. There is, however, large ambiguity in this when
 * using the hierarchical meshes used in this library, since in most cases the
 * computational domain is not approximated by tilting and deforming elements
 * and by plugging together variable numbers of elements at vertices, but
 * rather by hierarchical refinement. There is therefore a large number of
 * dofs with equal coordination numbers. The renumbering algorithms will
 * therefore not give optimal results.
 *
 * In the book of Schwarz (H.R.Schwarz: Methode der finiten Elemente), it is
 * advised to test many starting points, if possible all with the smallest
 * coordination number and also those with slightly higher numbers. However,
 * this seems only possible for meshes with at most several dozen or a few
 * hundred elements found in small engineering problems of the early 1980s
 * (the second edition was published in 1984), but certainly not with those
 * used in this library, featuring several 10,000 to a few 100,000 elements.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Implementation of renumbering schemes</h4>
 *
 * The renumbering algorithms need quite a lot of memory, since they have to
 * store for each dof with which other dofs it couples. This is done using a
 * SparsityPattern object used to store the sparsity pattern of matrices. It
 * is not useful for the user to do anything between distributing the dofs and
 * renumbering, i.e. the calls to DoFHandler::distribute_dofs and
 * DoFHandler::renumber_dofs should follow each other immediately. If you try
 * to create a sparsity pattern or anything else in between, these will be
 * invalid afterwards.
 *
 * The renumbering may take care of dof-to-dof couplings only induced by
 * eliminating constraints. In addition to the memory consumption mentioned
 * above, this also takes quite some computational time, but it may be
 * switched off upon calling the @p renumber_dofs function. This will then
 * give inferior results, since knots in the graph (representing dofs) are not
 * found to be neighbors even if they would be after condensation.
 *
 * The renumbering algorithms work on a purely algebraic basis, due to the
 * isomorphism between the graph theoretical groundwork underlying the
 * algorithms and binary matrices (matrices of which the entries are binary
 * values) represented by the sparsity patterns. In special, the algorithms do
 * not try to exploit topological knowledge (e.g. corner detection) to find
 * appropriate starting points. This way, however, they work in arbitrary
 * space dimension.
 *
 * If you want to give starting points, you may give a list of dof indices
 * which will form the first step of the renumbering. The dofs of the list
 * will be consecutively numbered starting with zero, i.e. this list is not
 * renumbered according to the coordination number of the nodes. Indices not
 * in the allowed range are deleted. If no index is allowed, the algorithm
 * will search for its own starting point.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Results of renumbering</h4>
 *
 * The renumbering schemes mentioned above do not lead to optimal results.
 * However, after all there is no algorithm that accomplishes this within
 * reasonable time. There are situations where the lack of optimality even
 * leads to worse results than with the original, crude, levelwise numbering
 * scheme; one of these examples is a mesh of four cells of which always those
 * cells are refined which are neighbors to the center (you may call this mesh
 * a `zoom in' mesh). In one such example the bandwidth was increased by about
 * 50 per cent.
 *
 * In most other cases, the bandwidth is reduced significantly. The reduction
 * is the better the less structured the grid is. With one grid where the
 * cells were refined according to a random driven algorithm, the bandwidth
 * was reduced by a factor of six.
 *
 * Using the constraint information usually leads to reductions in bandwidth
 * of 10 or 20 per cent, but may for some very unstructured grids also lead to
 * an increase. You have to weigh the decrease in your case with the time
 * spent to use the constraint information, which usually is several times
 * longer than the `pure' renumbering algorithm.
 *
 * In almost all cases, the renumbering scheme finds a corner to start with.
 * Since there is more than one corner in most grids and since even an
 * interior degree of freedom may be a better starting point, giving the
 * starting point by the user may be a viable way if you have a simple scheme
 * to derive a suitable point (e.g. by successively taking the third child of
 * the cell top left of the coarsest level, taking its third vertex and the
 * dof index thereof, if you want the top left corner vertex). If you do not
 * know beforehand what your grid will look like (e.g. when using adaptive
 * algorithms), searching a best starting point may be difficult, however, and
 * in many cases will not justify the effort.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Component-wise and block-wise numberings</h3>
 *
 * For finite elements composed of several base elements using the FESystem
 * class, or for elements which provide several components themselves, it may
 * be of interest to sort the DoF indices by component. This will then bring
 * out the block matrix structure, since otherwise the degrees of freedom are
 * numbered cell-wise without taking into account that they may belong to
 * different components. For example, one may want to sort degree of freedom
 * for a Stokes discretization so that we first get all velocities and then
 * all the pressures so that the resulting matrix naturally decomposes into a
 * $2\times 2$ system.
 *
 * This kind of numbering may be obtained by calling the component_wise()
 * function of this class. Since it does not touch the order of indices within
 * each component, it may be worthwhile to first renumber using the Cuthill-
 * McKee or a similar algorithm and afterwards renumbering component-wise.
 * This will bring out the matrix structure and additionally have a good
 * numbering within each block.
 *
 * The component_wise() function allows not only to honor enumeration based on
 * vector components, but also allows to group together vector components into
 * "blocks" using a defaulted argument to the various
 * DoFRenumbering::component_wise() functions (see
 * @ref GlossComponent
 * vs
 * @ref GlossBlock
 * for a description of the difference). The blocks designated through this
 * argument may, but do not have to be, equal to the blocks that the finite
 * element reports. For example, a typical Stokes element would be
 * @code
 *   FESystem<dim> stokes_fe (FE_Q<dim>(2), dim,   // dim velocities
 *                            FE_Q<dim>(1), 1);    // one pressure
 * @endcode
 * This element has <code>dim+1</code> vector components and equally many
 * blocks. However, one may want to consider the velocities as one logical
 * block so that all velocity degrees of freedom are enumerated the same way,
 * independent of whether they are $x$- or $y$-velocities. This is done, for
 * example, in step-20 and step-22 as well as several other tutorial programs.
 *
 * On the other hand, if you really want to use block structure reported by
 * the finite element itself (a case that is often the case if you have finite
 * elements that have multiple vector components, e.g. the FE_RaviartThomas or
 * FE_Nedelec elements) then you can use the DoFRenumbering::block_wise
 * instead of the DoFRenumbering::component_wise functions.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Cell-wise numbering</h3>
 *
 * Given an ordered vector of cells, the function cell_wise() sorts the
 * degrees of freedom such that degrees on earlier cells of this vector will
 * occur before degrees on later cells.
 *
 * This rule produces a well-defined ordering for discontinuous Galerkin
 * methods (FE_DGP, FE_DGQ). For continuous methods, we use the additional
 * rule that each degree of freedom is ordered according to the first cell in
 * the ordered vector it belongs to.
 *
 * Applications of this scheme are downstream() and clock_wise_dg(). The first
 * orders the cells according to a downstream direction and then applies
 * cell_wise().
 *
 * @note For DG elements, the internal numbering in each cell remains
 * unaffected. This cannot be guaranteed for continuous elements anymore,
 * since degrees of freedom shared with an earlier cell will be accounted for
 * by the other cell.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Random renumbering</h3>
 *
 * The random() function renumbers degrees of freedom randomly. This function
 * is probably seldom of use, except to check the dependence of solvers
 * (iterative or direct ones) on the numbering of the degrees of freedom.
 *
 *
 * <h3>A comparison of reordering strategies</h3>
 *
 * As a benchmark of comparison, let us consider what the different sparsity
 * patterns produced by the various algorithms when using the $Q_2^d\times
 * Q_1$ element combination typically employed in the discretization of Stokes
 * equations, when used on the mesh obtained in step-22 after one adaptive
 * mesh refinement in 3d. The space dimension together with the coupled finite
 * element leads to a rather dense system matrix with, on average around 180
 * nonzero entries per row. After applying each of the reordering strategies
 * shown below, the degrees of freedom are also sorted using
 * DoFRenumbering::component_wise into velocity and pressure groups; this
 * produces the $2\times 2$ block structure seen below with the large
 * velocity-velocity block at top left, small pressure-pressure block at
 * bottom right, and coupling blocks at top right and bottom left.
 *
 * The goal of reordering strategies is to improve the preconditioner. In
 * step-22 we use a SparseILU to preconditioner for the velocity-velocity
 * block at the top left. The quality of the preconditioner can then be
 * measured by the number of CG iterations required to solve a linear system
 * with this block. For some of the reordering strategies below we record this
 * number for adaptive refinement cycle 3, with 93176 degrees of freedom;
 * because we solve several linear systems with the same matrix in the Schur
 * complement, the average number of iterations is reported. The lower the
 * number the better the preconditioner and consequently the better the
 * renumbering of degrees of freedom is suited for this task. We also state
 * the run-time of the program, in part determined by the number of iterations
 * needed, for the first 4 cycles on one of our machines. Note that the
 * reported times correspond to the run time of the entire program, not just
 * the affected solver; if a program runs twice as fast with one particular
 * ordering than with another one, then this means that the actual solver is
 * actually several times faster.

   * <h4> Operation in parallel </h4>
   *
   * If the given DoFHandler uses a distributed triangulation (i.e., if
   * dof_handler.locally_owned() is not the complete index set), the
   * renumbering is performed on each processor's degrees of freedom
   * individually, without any communication between processors. In other
   * words, the resulting renumbering is an attempt at minimizing the bandwidth
   * of <i>each diagonal block of the matrix corresponding to one processor</i>
   * separately, without making an attempt at minimizing the bandwidth of
   * the global matrix. Furthermore, the renumbering reuses exactly the
   * same set of DoF indices that each processor used before. In other words,
   * if the previous numbering of DoFs on one processor used a contiguous
   * range of DoF indices, then so will the DoFs on that processor after
   * the renumbering, and they will occupy the same range. The same is true
   * if the previous numbering of DoFs on a processor consisted of a number
   * of index ranges or single indices: after renumbering, the locally owned
   * DoFs on that processor will use the exact same indices, just in a
   * different order.
   *
   * In addition, if the DoFHandler is built on a parallel triangulation, then
   * on every processor, the starting indices for renumbering need to be a
   * (possibly empty) subset of the
   * @ref GlossLocallyActiveDof "locally active degrees of freedom". In
   * general, these starting indices will be different on each processor
   * (unless of course you pass an empty list as is the default),
   * and each processor will use them as starting indices for the local
   * renumbering on that processor.
   *
   * The starting indices must be locally active degrees of freedom, but
   * the function will only renumber the locally owned subset of the
   * locally owned DoFs. The function accepts starting indices from the
   * largest set of locally active degrees of freedom because a typical
   * renumbering operation with this function starts with indices that
   * are located on the boundary -- in the case of the current function,
   * that would be the boundary between processor subdomains. Since the
   * degrees of freedom that are located on subdomain interfaces may
   * be owned by either one of the two processors that own the adjacent
   * subdomains, it is not always easy to identify starting indices that
   * are locally owned. On the other hand, all degrees of freedom on subdomain
   * interfaces are locally active, and so the function accepts them as
   * starting indices even though it can only renumber them on a given
   * processor if they are also locally owned.

  /**
   * Renumber the degrees cell by cell by traversing the cells in
   * @ref GlossZOrder "Z order".
   *
   * There are two reasons to use this function:
   * - It produces a predictable ordering of degrees of freedom
   *   that is independent of how exactly you arrived at a mesh.
   *   In particular, in general the order of cells of a mesh
   *   depends on the order in which cells were marked for
   *   refinement and coarsening during the refinement cycles
   *   the mesh has undergone. On the other hand, the z-order
   *   of cells is independent of the mesh's history, and so yields a
   *   predictable DoF numbering.
   * - For meshes based on parallel::distributed::Triangulation,
   *   the
   *   @ref GlossLocallyOwnedCell "locally owned cells"
   *   of
   *   each MPI process are contiguous in Z order. That means that
   *   numbering degrees of freedom by visiting cells in Z order yields
   *   @ref GlossLocallyOwnedDof "locally owned DoF indices"
   *   that consist
   *   of contiguous ranges for each process. This is also true for the
   *   default ordering of DoFs on such triangulations, but the default
   *   ordering creates an enumeration that also depends on how many
   *   processors participate in the mesh, whereas the one generated
   *   by this function enumerates the degrees of freedom on a particular
   *   cell with indices that will be the same regardless of how many
   *   processes the mesh is split up between.
   *
   * For meshes based on parallel::shared::Triangulation, the situation is
   * more complex. Here, the set of locally owned cells is determined by
   * a partitioning algorithm (selected by passing an object of type
   * parallel::shared::Triangulation::Settings to the constructor of the
   * triangulation), and in general these partitioning algorithms may
   * assign cells to
   * @ref GlossSubdomainId "subdomains"
   * based on
   * decisions that may have nothing to do with the Z order. (Though it
   * is possible to select these flags in a way so that partitioning
   * uses the Z order.) As a consequence, the cells of one subdomain
   * are not contiguous in Z order, and if one renumbered degrees of freedom
   * based on the Z order of cells, one would generally end up with DoF
   * indices that on each processor do not form a contiguous range.
   * This is often inconvenient (for example, because PETSc cannot store
   * vectors and matrices for which the locally owned set of indices
   * is not contiguous), and consequently this function uses the following
   * algorithm for parallel::shared::Triangulation objects:
   * - It determines how many degrees of freedom each processor owns.
   *   This is an invariant under renumbering, and consequently we can
   *   use how many DoFs each processor owns at the beginning of the current
   *   function. Let us call this number $n_P$ for processor $P$.
   * - It determines for each processor a contiguous range of new
   *   DoF indices $[b_P,e_P)$ so that $e_P-b_P=n_P$, $b_0=0$, and
   *   $b_P=e_{P-1}$.
   * - It traverses the <i>locally owned cells</i> in Z order and
   *   renumbers the locally owned degrees of freedom on these cells
   *   so that the new numbers fit within the interval $[b_P,e_P)$.
   * In other words, the <i>locally owned degrees of freedom</i> on each
   * processor are sorted according to the Z order of the locally
   * owned cells they are on, but this property may not hold globally,
   * across cells. This is because the partitioning algorithm may have
   * decided that, for example, processor 0 owns a cell that comes
   * <i>later</i> in Z order than one of the cells assigned to processor 1.
   * On the other hand, the algorithm described above assigns the
   * degrees of freedom on this cell <i>earlier</i> indices than
   * all of the indices owned by processor 1.
   *
   * @note This function generates an ordering that is independent of the previous
   * numbering of degrees of freedom. In other words, any information that may
   * have been produced by a previous call to a renumbering function is
   * ignored.
