/**
 * Implementation of a number of renumbering algorithms for the degrees of
 * freedom on a triangulation.
 *
 * <h3>Cuthill-McKee like algorithms</h3>
 *
 * Within this class, the Cuthill-McKee algorithm is implemented. It starts at
 * a degree of freedom, searches the other DoFs for those which are coupled
 * with the one we started with and numbers these in a certain way. It then
 * finds the second level of DoFs, namely those that couple with those of the
 * previous level (which were those that coupled with the initial DoF) and
 * numbers these. And so on. For the details of the algorithm, especially the
 * numbering within each level, please see H. R. Schwarz: "Methode der finiten
 * Elemente". The reverse Cuthill-McKee algorithm does the same job, but
 * numbers all elements in the reverse order.
 *
 * These algorithms have one major drawback: they require a good starting
 * point, i.e. the degree of freedom index that will get a new index of zero.
 * The renumbering functions therefore allow the caller to specify such an
 * initial DoF, e.g. by exploiting knowledge of the actual topology of the
 * domain. It is also possible to give several starting indices, which may be
 * used to simulate a simple upstream numbering (by giving the inflow dofs as
 * starting values) or to make preconditioning faster (by letting the
 * Dirichlet boundary indices be starting points).
 *
 * If no starting index is given, one is chosen automatically, namely one with
 * the smallest coordination number (the coordination number is the number of
 * other dofs this dof couples with). This dof is usually located on the
 * boundary of the domain. There is, however, large ambiguity in this when
 * using the hierarchical meshes used in this library, since in most cases the
 * computational domain is not approximated by tilting and deforming elements
 * and by plugging together variable numbers of elements at vertices, but
 * rather by hierarchical refinement. There is therefore a large number of
 * dofs with equal coordination numbers. The renumbering algorithms will
 * therefore not give optimal results.
 *
 * In the book of Schwarz (H.R.Schwarz: Methode der finiten Elemente), it is
 * advised to test many starting points, if possible all with the smallest
 * coordination number and also those with slightly higher numbers. However,
 * this seems only possible for meshes with at most several dozen or a few
 * hundred elements found in small engineering problems of the early 1980s
 * (the second edition was published in 1984), but certainly not with those
 * used in this library, featuring several 10,000 to a few 100,000 elements.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Implementation of renumbering schemes</h4>
 *
 * The renumbering algorithms need quite a lot of memory, since they have to
 * store for each dof with which other dofs it couples. This is done using a
 * SparsityPattern object used to store the sparsity pattern of matrices. It
 * is not useful for the user to do anything between distributing the dofs and
 * renumbering, i.e. the calls to DoFHandler::distribute_dofs and
 * DoFHandler::renumber_dofs should follow each other immediately. If you try
 * to create a sparsity pattern or anything else in between, these will be
 * invalid afterwards.
 *
 * The renumbering may take care of dof-to-dof couplings only induced by
 * eliminating constraints. In addition to the memory consumption mentioned
 * above, this also takes quite some computational time, but it may be
 * switched off upon calling the @p renumber_dofs function. This will then
 * give inferior results, since knots in the graph (representing dofs) are not
 * found to be neighbors even if they would be after condensation.
 *
 * The renumbering algorithms work on a purely algebraic basis, due to the
 * isomorphism between the graph theoretical groundwork underlying the
 * algorithms and binary matrices (matrices of which the entries are binary
 * values) represented by the sparsity patterns. In special, the algorithms do
 * not try to exploit topological knowledge (e.g. corner detection) to find
 * appropriate starting points. This way, however, they work in arbitrary
 * space dimension.
 *
 * If you want to give starting points, you may give a list of dof indices
 * which will form the first step of the renumbering. The dofs of the list
 * will be consecutively numbered starting with zero, i.e. this list is not
 * renumbered according to the coordination number of the nodes. Indices not
 * in the allowed range are deleted. If no index is allowed, the algorithm
 * will search for its own starting point.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Results of renumbering</h4>
 *
 * The renumbering schemes mentioned above do not lead to optimal results.
 * However, after all there is no algorithm that accomplishes this within
 * reasonable time. There are situations where the lack of optimality even
 * leads to worse results than with the original, crude, levelwise numbering
 * scheme; one of these examples is a mesh of four cells of which always those
 * cells are refined which are neighbors to the center (you may call this mesh
 * a `zoom in' mesh). In one such example the bandwidth was increased by about
 * 50 per cent.
 *
 * In most other cases, the bandwidth is reduced significantly. The reduction
 * is the better the less structured the grid is. With one grid where the
 * cells were refined according to a random driven algorithm, the bandwidth
 * was reduced by a factor of six.
 *
 * Using the constraint information usually leads to reductions in bandwidth
 * of 10 or 20 per cent, but may for some very unstructured grids also lead to
 * an increase. You have to weigh the decrease in your case with the time
 * spent to use the constraint information, which usually is several times
 * longer than the `pure' renumbering algorithm.
 *
 * In almost all cases, the renumbering scheme finds a corner to start with.
 * Since there is more than one corner in most grids and since even an
 * interior degree of freedom may be a better starting point, giving the
 * starting point by the user may be a viable way if you have a simple scheme
 * to derive a suitable point (e.g. by successively taking the third child of
 * the cell top left of the coarsest level, taking its third vertex and the
 * dof index thereof, if you want the top left corner vertex). If you do not
 * know beforehand what your grid will look like (e.g. when using adaptive
 * algorithms), searching a best starting point may be difficult, however, and
 * in many cases will not justify the effort.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Component-wise and block-wise numberings</h3>
 *
 * For finite elements composed of several base elements using the FESystem
 * class, or for elements which provide several components themselves, it may
 * be of interest to sort the DoF indices by component. This will then bring
 * out the block matrix structure, since otherwise the degrees of freedom are
 * numbered cell-wise without taking into account that they may belong to
 * different components. For example, one may want to sort degree of freedom
 * for a Stokes discretization so that we first get all velocities and then
 * all the pressures so that the resulting matrix naturally decomposes into a
 * $2\times 2$ system.
 *
 * This kind of numbering may be obtained by calling the component_wise()
 * function of this class. Since it does not touch the order of indices within
 * each component, it may be worthwhile to first renumber using the Cuthill-
 * McKee or a similar algorithm and afterwards renumbering component-wise.
 * This will bring out the matrix structure and additionally have a good
 * numbering within each block.
 *
 * The component_wise() function allows not only to honor enumeration based on
 * vector components, but also allows to group together vector components into
 * "blocks" using a defaulted argument to the various
 * DoFRenumber::component_wise() functions (see
 * @ref GlossComponent
 * vs
 * @ref GlossBlock
 * for a description of the difference). The blocks designated through this
 * argument may, but do not have to be, equal to the blocks that the finite
 * element reports. For example, a typical Stokes element would be
 * @code
 *   FESystem<dim> stokes_fe (FE_Q<dim>(2), dim,   // dim velocities
 *                            FE_Q<dim>(1), 1);    // one pressure
 * @endcode
 * This element has <code>dim+1</code> vector components and equally many
 * blocks. However, one may want to consider the velocities as one logical
 * block so that all velocity degrees of freedom are enumerated the same way,
 * independent of whether they are $x$- or $y$-velocities. This is done, for
 * example, in step-20 and step-22 as well as several other tutorial programs.
 *
 * On the other hand, if you really want to use block structure reported by
 * the finite element itself (a case that is often the case if you have finite
 * elements that have multiple vector components, e.g. the FE_RaviartThomas or
 * FE_Nedelec elements) then you can use the DoFRenumber::block_wise instead
 * of the DoFRenumbering::component_wise functions.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Cell-wise numbering</h3>
 *
 * Given an ordered vector of cells, the function cell_wise() sorts the
 * degrees of freedom such that degrees on earlier cells of this vector will
 * occur before degrees on later cells.
 *
 * This rule produces a well-defined ordering for discontinuous Galerkin
 * methods (FE_DGP, FE_DGQ). For continuous methods, we use the additional
 * rule that each degree of freedom is ordered according to the first cell in
 * the ordered vector it belongs to.
 *
 * Applications of this scheme are downstream() and clock_wise_dg(). The first
 * orders the cells according to a downstream direction and then applies
 * cell_wise().
 *
 * @note For DG elements, the internal numbering in each cell remains
 * unaffected. This cannot be guaranteed for continuous elements anymore,
 * since degrees of freedom shared with an earlier cell will be accounted for
 * by the other cell.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Random renumbering</h3>
 *
 * The random() function renumbers degrees of freedom randomly. This function
 * is probably seldom of use, except to check the dependence of solvers
 * (iterative or direct ones) on the numbering of the degrees of freedom. It
 * uses the @p random_shuffle function from the C++ standard library to do its
 * work.
 *
 *
 * <h3>A comparison of reordering strategies</h3>
 *
 * As a benchmark of comparison, let us consider what the different sparsity
 * patterns produced by the various algorithms when using the $Q_2^d\times
 * Q_1$ element combination typically employed in the discretization of Stokes
 * equations, when used on the mesh obtained in step-22 after one adaptive
 * mesh refinement in 3d. The space dimension together with the coupled finite
 * element leads to a rather dense system matrix with, on average around 180
 * nonzero entries per row. After applying each of the reordering strategies
 * shown below, the degrees of freedom are also sorted using
 * DoFRenumbering::component_wise into velocity and pressure groups; this
 * produces the $2\times 2$ block structure seen below with the large
 * velocity-velocity block at top left, small pressure-pressure block at
 * bottom right, and coupling blocks at top right and bottom left.
 *
 * The goal of reordering strategies is to improve the preconditioner. In
 * step-22 we use a SparseILU to preconditioner for the velocity-velocity
 * block at the top left. The quality of the preconditioner can then be
 * measured by the number of CG iterations required to solve a linear system
 * with this block. For some of the reordering strategies below we record this
 * number for adaptive refinement cycle 3, with 93176 degrees of freedom;
 * because we solve several linear systems with the same matrix in the Schur
 * complement, the average number of iterations is reported. The lower the
 * number the better the preconditioner and consequently the better the
 * renumbering of degrees of freedom is suited for this task. We also state
 * the run-time of the program, in part determined by the number of iterations
 * needed, for the first 4 cycles on one of our machines. Note that the
 * reported times correspond to the run time of the entire program, not just
 * the affected solver; if a program runs twice as fast with one particular
 * ordering than with another one, then this means that the actual solver is
 * actually several times faster.

 * that would be occupied by elements of an LU decomposition that are not
 * already occupied by elements of the original matrix. The resulting sparsity
 * pattern obviously has an entirely different structure than the ones
