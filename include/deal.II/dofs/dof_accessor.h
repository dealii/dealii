/**
 * A class that gives access to the degrees of freedom stored in a DoFHandler,
 * MGSoDHandler, or hp::DoFHandler object. Accessors are used to, access the
 * data that pertains to edges, faces, and cells of a triangulation. The
 * concept is explained in more detail in connection to
 * @ref Iterators.
 *
 * This class follows mainly the route laid out by the accessor library
 * declared in the triangulation library (TriaAccessor). It enables the user
 * to access the degrees of freedom on lines, quads, or hexes. The first
 * template argument of this class determines the dimensionality of the object
 * under consideration: 1 for lines, 2 for quads, and 3 for hexes. The second
 * argument denotes the type of DoF handler we should work on. It can either
 * be ::DoFHandler or hp::DoFHandler.  From the second template argument we
 * also deduce the dimension of the Triangulation this object refers to as
 * well as the dimension of the space into which it is embedded. Finally, the
 * template argument <code>level_dof_access</code> governs the behavior of the
 * function get_active_or_mg_dof_indices(). See the section on Generic loops
 * below.
 *
 * <h3>Typedefs</h3>
 *
 * Usage is best to happen through the typedefs to the various kinds of
 * iterators provided by the DoFHandler and hp::DoFHandler classes, since they
 * are more secure to changes in the class naming and template interface as
 * well as providing easier typing (much less complicated names!).
 *
 * <h3>Generic loops and the third template argument</h3>
 *
 * Many loops look very similar, whether they operate on the active dofs of
 * the active cells of the Triangulation or on the level dodfs of a single
 * level or the whole grid hierarchy. In order to use polymorphism in such
 * loops, they access degrees of freedom through the function
 * get_active_or_mg_dof_indices(), which changes behavior according to the
 * third template argument.  If the argument is false, then the active dofs of
 * active cells are accessed. If it is true, the level dofs are used.
 * DoFHandler has functions, for instance begin() and begin_mg(), which return
 * either type or the other. Additionally, they can be cast into each other,
 * in case this is needed, since they access the same data.
 *
 * It is highly recommended to use the function get_active_or_mg_dof_indices()
 * in generic loops in lieu of get_dof_indices() or get_mg_dof_indices().
 *
 * <h3>Inheritance</h3>
 *
 * If the structural dimension given by the first template argument equals the
 * dimension of the DoFHandler (given as the second template argument), then
 * we are obviously dealing with cells, rather than lower-dimensional objects.
 * In that case, inheritance is from CellAccessor, to provide access to all
 * the cell specific information afforded by that class. Otherwise, i.e. for
 * lower-dimensional objects, inheritance is from TriaAccessor.
 *
 * There is a DoFCellAccessor class that provides the equivalent to the
 * CellAccessor class.
