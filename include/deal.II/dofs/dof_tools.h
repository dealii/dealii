/**
 * This is a collection of functions operating on, and manipulating the
 * numbers of degrees of freedom. The documentation of the member functions
 * will provide more information, but for functions that exist in multiple
 * versions, there are sections in this global documentation stating some
 * commonalities.
 *
 * All member functions are static, so there is no need to create an object of
 * class DoFTools.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Setting up sparsity patterns</h3>
 *
 * When assembling system matrices, the entries are usually of the form
 * $a_{ij} = a(\phi_i, \phi_j)$, where $a$ is a bilinear functional, often an
 * integral. When using sparse matrices, we therefore only need to reserve
 * space for those $a_{ij}$ only, which are nonzero, which is the same as to
 * say that the basis functions $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$ have a nonempty
 * intersection of their support. Since the support of basis functions is
 * bound only on cells on which they are located or to which they are
 * adjacent, to determine the sparsity pattern it is sufficient to loop over
 * all cells and connect all basis functions on each cell with all other basis
 * functions on that cell.  There may be finite elements for which not all
 * basis functions on a cell connect with each other, but no use of this case
 * is made since no examples where this occurs are known to the author.
 *
 *
 * <h3>DoF numberings on boundaries</h3>
 *
 * When projecting the traces of functions to the boundary or parts thereof,
 * one needs to build matrices and vectors that act only on those degrees of
 * freedom that are located on the boundary, rather than on all degrees of
 * freedom. One could do that by simply building matrices in which the entries
 * for all interior DoFs are zero, but such matrices are always very rank
 * deficient and not very practical to work with.
 *
 * What is needed instead in this case is a numbering of the boundary degrees
 * of freedom, i.e. we should enumerate all the degrees of freedom that are
 * sitting on the boundary, and exclude all other (interior) degrees of
 * freedom. The map_dof_to_boundary_indices() function does exactly this: it
 * provides a vector with as many entries as there are degrees of freedom on
 * the whole domain, with each entry being the number in the numbering of the
 * boundary or DoFHandler::invalid_dof_index if the dof is not on the
 * boundary.
 *
 * With this vector, one can get, for any given degree of freedom, a unique
 * number among those DoFs that sit on the boundary; or, if your DoF was
 * interior to the domain, the result would be DoFHandler::invalid_dof_index.
 * We need this mapping, for example, to build the mass matrix on the boundary
 * (for this, see make_boundary_sparsity_pattern() function, the corresponding
 * section below, as well as the MatrixCreator class documentation).
 *
 * Actually, there are two map_dof_to_boundary_indices() functions, one
 * producing a numbering for all boundary degrees of freedom and one producing
 * a numbering for only parts of the boundary, namely those parts for which
 * the boundary indicator is listed in a set of indicators given to the
 * function. The latter case is needed if, for example, we would only want to
 * project the boundary values for the Dirichlet part of the boundary. You
 * then give the function a list of boundary indicators referring to Dirichlet
 * parts on which the projection is to be performed. The parts of the boundary
 * on which you want to project need not be contiguous; however, it is not
 * guaranteed that the indices of each of the boundary parts are continuous,
 * i.e. the indices of degrees of freedom on different parts may be
 * intermixed.
 *
 * Degrees of freedom on the boundary but not on one of the specified boundary
 * parts are given the index DoFHandler::invalid_dof_index, as if they were in
 * the interior. If no boundary indicator was given or if no face of a cell
 * has a boundary indicator contained in the given list, the vector of new
 * indices consists solely of DoFHandler::invalid_dof_index.
 *
 * (As a side note, for corner cases: The question what a degree of freedom on
 * the boundary is, is not so easy.  It should really be a degree of freedom
 * of which the respective basis function has nonzero values on the boundary.
 * At least for Lagrange elements this definition is equal to the statement
 * that the off-point, or what deal.II calls support_point, of the shape
 * function, i.e. the point where the function assumes its nominal value (for
 * Lagrange elements this is the point where it has the function value 1), is
 * located on the boundary. We do not check this directly, the criterion is
 * rather defined through the information the finite element class gives: the
 * FiniteElement class defines the numbers of basis functions per vertex, per
 * line, and so on and the basis functions are numbered after this
 * information; a basis function is to be considered to be on the face of a
 * cell (and thus on the boundary if the cell is at the boundary) according to
 * it belonging to a vertex, line, etc but not to the interior of the cell.
 * The finite element uses the same cell-wise numbering so that we can say
 * that if a degree of freedom was numbered as one of the dofs on lines, we
 * assume that it is located on the line. Where the off-point actually is, is
 * a secret of the finite element (well, you can ask it, but we don't do it
 * here) and not relevant in this context.)
 *
 *
 * <h3>Setting up sparsity patterns for boundary matrices</h3>
 *
 * In some cases, one wants to only work with DoFs that sit on the boundary.
 * One application is, for example, if rather than interpolating non-
 * homogenous boundary values, one would like to project them. For this, we
 * need two things: a way to identify nodes that are located on (parts of) the
 * boundary, and a way to build matrices out of only degrees of freedom that
 * are on the boundary (i.e. much smaller matrices, in which we do not even
 * build the large zero block that stems from the fact that most degrees of
 * freedom have no support on the boundary of the domain). The first of these
 * tasks is done by the map_dof_to_boundary_indices() function of this class
 * (described above).
 *
 * The second part requires us first to build a sparsity pattern for the
 * couplings between boundary nodes, and then to actually build the components
 * of this matrix. While actually computing the entries of these small
 * boundary matrices is discussed in the MatrixCreator class, the creation of
 * the sparsity pattern is done by the create_boundary_sparsity_pattern()
 * function. For its work, it needs to have a numbering of all those degrees
 * of freedom that are on those parts of the boundary that we are interested
 * in. You can get this from the map_dof_to_boundary_indices() function. It
 * then builds the sparsity pattern corresponding to integrals like
 * $\int_\Gamma \varphi_{b2d(i)} \varphi_{b2d(j)} dx$, where $i$ and $j$ are
 * indices into the matrix, and $b2d(i)$ is the global DoF number of a degree
 * of freedom sitting on a boundary (i.e., $b2d$ is the inverse of the mapping
 * returned by map_dof_to_boundary_indices() function).

   * This function is used when different variables in a problem are
   * discretized on different grids, where one grid is strictly coarser than
   * the other. An example are optimization problems where the control
   * variable is often discretized on a coarser mesh than the state variable.
   *
   * The function's result can be stated as follows mathematically: Let ${\cal
   * T}_0$ and ${\cal T}_1$ be two meshes where ${\cal T}_1$ results from
   * ${\cal T}_0$ strictly by refining or leaving alone the cells of ${\cal
   * T}_0$. Using the same finite element on both, there are function spaces
   * ${\cal V}_0$ and ${\cal V}_1$ associated with these meshes. Then every
   * function $v_0 \in {\cal V}_0$ can of course also be represented exactly
   * in ${\cal V}_1$ since by construction ${\cal V}_0 \subset {\cal V}_1$.
   * However, not every function in ${\cal V}_1$ can be expressed as a linear
   * combination of the shape functions of ${\cal V}_0$. The functions that
   * can be represented lie in a homogenous subspace of ${\cal V}_1$ (namely,
   * ${\cal V}_0$, of course) and this subspace can be represented by a linear
   * constraint of the form $CV=0$ where $V$ is the vector of nodal values of
   * functions $v\in {\cal V}_1$. In other words, every function $v_h=\sum_j
   * V_j \varphi_j^{(1)} \in {\cal V}_1$ that also satisfies $v_h\in {\cal
   * V}_0$ automatically satisfies $CV=0$. This function computes the matrix
   * $C$ in the form of a ConstraintMatrix object.
   *
   * The construction of these constraints is done as follows: for each of the
   * degrees of freedom (i.e. shape functions) on the coarse grid, we compute
   * its representation on the fine grid, i.e. how the linear combination of
   * shape functions on the fine grid looks like that resembles the shape
   * function on the coarse grid. From this information, we can then compute
   * the constraints which have to hold if a solution of a linear equation on
   * the fine grid shall be representable on the coarse grid. The exact
   * algorithm how these constraints can be computed is rather complicated and
   * is best understood by reading the source code, which contains many
   * comments.
   *
   * The use of this function is as follows: it accepts as parameters two DoF
   * Handlers, the first of which refers to the coarse grid and the second of
   * which is the fine grid. On both, a finite element is represented by the
   * DoF handler objects, which will usually have several vector components,
   * which may belong to different base elements. The second and fourth
   * parameter of this function therefore state which vector component on the
   * coarse grid shall be used to restrict the stated component on the fine
   * grid. The finite element used for the respective components on the two
   * grids needs to be the same. An example may clarify this: consider an
   * optimization problem with controls $q$ discretized on a coarse mesh and a
   * state variable $u$ (and corresponding Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$)
   * discretized on the fine mesh. These are discretized using piecewise
   * constant discontinuous, continuous linear, and continuous linear
   * elements, respectively. Only the parameter $q$ is represented on the
   * coarse grid, thus the DoFHandler object on the coarse grid represents
   * only one variable, discretized using piecewise constant discontinuous
   * elements. Then, the parameter denoting the vector component on the coarse
   * grid would be zero (the only possible choice, since the variable on the
   * coarse grid is scalar). If the ordering of variables in the fine mesh
   * FESystem is $u, q, \lambda$, then the fourth argument of the function
   * corresponding to the vector component would be one (corresponding to the
   * variable $q$; zero would be $u$, two would be $\lambda$).
   *
   * The function also requires an object of type IntergridMap representing
   * how to get from the coarse mesh cells to the corresponding cells on the
   * fine mesh. This could in principle be generated by the function itself
   * from the two DoFHandler objects, but since it is probably available
   * anyway in programs that use different meshes, the function simply takes
   * it as an argument.
   *
   * The computed constraints are entered into a variable of type
   * ConstraintMatrix; previous contents are not deleted.

   * Insert the (algebraic) constraints due to periodic boundary conditions
   * into a ConstraintMatrix @p constraint_matrix.
   *
   * Given a pair of not necessarily active boundary faces @p face_1 and @p
   * face_2, this functions constrains all DoFs associated with the boundary
   * described by @p face_1 to the respective DoFs of the boundary described
   * by @p face_2. More precisely:
   *
   * If @p face_1 and @p face_2 are both active faces it adds the DoFs of @p
   * face_1 to the list of constrained DoFs in @p constraint_matrix and adds
   * entries to constrain them to the corresponding values of the DoFs on @p
   * face_2. This happens on a purely algebraic level, meaning, the global DoF
   * with (local face) index <tt>i</tt> on @p face_1 gets constraint to the
   * DoF with (local face) index <tt>i</tt> on @p face_2 (possibly corrected
   * for orientation, see below).
   *
   * Otherwise, if @p face_1 and @p face_2 are not active faces, this function
   * loops recursively over the children of @p face_1 and @p face_2. If only
   * one of the two faces is active, then we recursively iterate over the
   * children of the non-active ones and make sure that the solution function
   * on the refined side equals that on the non-refined face in much the same
   * way as we enforce hanging node constraints at places where differently
   * refined cells come together. (However, unlike hanging nodes, we do not
   * enforce the requirement that there be only a difference of one refinement
   * level between the two sides of the domain you would like to be periodic).
   *
   * This routine only constrains DoFs that are not already constrained. If
   * this routine encounters a DoF that already is constrained (for instance
   * by Dirichlet boundary conditions), the old setting of the constraint
   * (dofs the entry is constrained to, inhomogeneities) is kept and nothing
   * happens.
   *
   * The flags in the @p component_mask (see
   * @ref GlossComponentMask)
   * denote which components of the finite element space shall be constrained
   * with periodic boundary conditions. If it is left as specified by the
   * default value all components are constrained. If it is different from the
   * default value, it is assumed that the number of entries equals the number
   * of components of the finite element. This can be used to enforce
   * periodicity in only one variable in a system of equations.
   *
   * @p face_orientation, @p face_flip and @p face_rotation describe an
   * orientation that should be applied to @p face_1 prior to matching and
   * constraining DoFs. This has nothing to do with the actual orientation of
   * the given faces in their respective cells (which for boundary faces is
   * always the default) but instead how you want to see periodicity to be
   * enforced. For example, by using these flags, you can enforce a condition
   * of the kind $u(0,y)=u(1,1-y)$ (i.e., a Moebius band) or in 3d a twisted
   * torus. More precisely, these flags match local face DoF indices in the
   * following manner:
   *
   * In 2d: <tt>face_orientation</tt> must always be <tt>true</tt>,
   * <tt>face_rotation</tt> is always <tt>false</tt>, and face_flip has the
