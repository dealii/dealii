     *
     * <h4>DoFFaces</h4>
     *
     * These classes are similar to the DoFLevel classes. We here store
     * information that is associated with faces, rather than cells, as this
     * information is independent of the hierarchical structure of cells,
     * which are organized in levels. In 2D we store information on degrees of
     * freedom located on lines whereas in 3D we store information on degrees
     * of freedom located on quads and lines. In 1D we do nothing, as the
     * faces of lines are vertices which are treated separately.
     *
     * Apart from the DoFObjects object containing the data to store (degree
     * of freedom indices) we do not store any data or provide any
     * functionality. However, we do implement a function to determine an
     * estimate of the memory consumption of the contained DoFObjects
     * object(s).
     *
     * The data contained isn't usually directly accessed. Rather, except for
     * some access from the DoFHandler class, access is usually through the
     * DoFAccessor::set_dof_index() and DoFAccessor::dof_index() functions or
     * similar functions of derived classes that in turn access the member
     * variables using the DoFHandler::get_dof_index() and corresponding
     * setter functions. Knowledge of the actual data format is therefore
     * encapsulated to the present hierarchy of classes as well as the
     * dealii::DoFHandler class.
