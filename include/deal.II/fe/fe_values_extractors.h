/**
 * A namespace in which we declare "extractors", i.e. classes that when used
 * as subscripts in operator[] expressions on FEValues, FEFaceValues, and
 * FESubfaceValues objects extract certain components of a vector-valued
 * element. The result of applying an extractor to these objects is an object
 * with corresponding type from the namespace FEValuesViews. There are
 * extractors for single scalar components, vector components consisting of
 * <code>dim</code> elements, and second order symmetric tensors consisting of
 * <code>(dim*dim + dim)/2</code> components, as well as second order
 * nonsymmetric tensors.
 *
 * One can think of extractors as the equivalent of an index, or an index range.
 * In the case of scalar extractors (i.e., the FEValuesExtractors::Scalar
 * class), creating an object like (see step-20 for this use)
 * @code
 *   const FEValuesExtractors::Scalar pressure(dim);
 * @endcode
 * can be thought of as creating a single index with value `dim`. By
 * itself, an index does not know what it is an index to, so it takes
 * the equivalent of an array to extract anything. Consequently,
 * assume that there is a finite element with at least `dim+1` vector
 * components (as indeed there is in step-20), and an FEValues object
 * that operates on it, then writing
 * @code
 *   fe_values[pressure]
 * @endcode
 * results in an object that represents the shape functions of only the
 * `dim`th component of the overall element. In the example, these
 * would be the values of the pressure shape functions, or more precisely:
 * the (scalar) pressure values of all shape functions (even for shape
 * functions that are not associated with the pressure, but for example
 * the velocity). In the example above, the result of using
 * `operator[]` on the `fe_values` object as shown is of type
 * FEValuesViews::Scalar.
 *
 * Likewise, when using
 * @code
 *   const FEValuesExtractors::Vector velocities(0);
 * @endcode
 * then the object so created can be thought of as an <i>index range</i>,
 * starting at zero and extending exactly `dim` components on. In Matlab
 * notation, one could write this as `0:dim-1`. Then, writing
 * @code
 *   fe_values[velocities]
 * @endcode
 * will result in an object that represents the values of a subset of
 * exactly `dim` vector components of the overall finite element, in
 * much the same way as writing `array(3:7)` in Matlab would return
 * an array of length 5 that has been extracted from the original
 * array by looking at indices 3 through 7 (inclusive).
 *
 * See the description of the
 * @ref vector_valued
 * topic for examples how to use the features of this namespace.

   * just a collection of scalar variables, since they do not change if the
   * coordinate system is rotated, unlike the components of a velocity vector,
   * and consequently, this class should not be used for this context.
