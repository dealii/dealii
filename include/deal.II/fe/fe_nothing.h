/**
 * Definition of a finite element space with zero degrees of freedom and that,
 * consequently, can only represent a single function: the zero function.
 *
 * This class is useful (in the context of an hp-method) to represent empty
 * cells in the triangulation on which no degrees of freedom should be
 * allocated, or to describe a field that is extended by zero to a part of the
 * domain where we don't need it. Thus a triangulation may be divided into two
 * regions: an active region where normal elements are used, and an inactive
 * region where FE_Nothing elements are used. The DoFHandler will therefore
 * assign no degrees of freedom to the FE_Nothing cells, and this subregion is
 * therefore implicitly deleted from the computation. step-10 and step-46 show
 * use cases for this element. An interesting application for this element is
 * also presented in the paper @cite Cangiani2012.
 *
 *
 * <h3>FE_Nothing as seen as a function space</h3>
 *
 * Finite elements are often best interpreted as forming a
 * [function space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space), i.e., a
 * set of functions that form a
 * [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space). One can indeed
 * interpret FE_Nothing in this light: It corresponds to the function space
 * $V_h=\{0\}$, i.e., the set of functions that are zero everywhere.
 * (The constructor can take an argument that, if greater than one, extends
 * the space to one of vector-valued functions with more than one component,
 * with all components equal to zero everywhere.) Indeed, this is a vector
 * space since every linear combination of elements in the vector space is
 * also an element in the vector space, as is every multiple of the single
 * element zero. It is obvious that the function space has no degrees of
 * freedom, thus the name of the class.
 *
 *
 * <h3>FE_Nothing in combination with other elements</h3>
 *
 * In situations such as those of step-46, one uses FE_Nothing on cells
 * where one is not interested in a solution variable. For example, in fluid
 * structure interaction problems, the fluid velocity is only defined on
 * cells inside the fluid part of the domain. One then uses FE_Nothing
 * on cells in the solid part of the domain to describe the finite element
 * space for the velocity. In other words, the velocity lives everywhere
 * conceptually, but it is identically zero in those parts of the domain
 * where it is not of interest and doesn't use up any degrees of freedom
 * there.
 *
 * The question is what happens at the interface between areas where one
 * is interested in the solution (and uses a "normal" finite element) and
 * where one is not interested (and uses FE_Nothing): Should the solution
 * at that interface be zero -- i.e., we consider a "continuous" finite
 * element field that happens to be zero in that area where FE_Nothing
 * is used -- or is there no requirement for continuity at the interface.
 * In the deal.II language, this is encoded by what the function
 * FiniteElement::compare_for_domination() returns: If the FE_Nothing
 * "dominates", then the solution must be zero at the interface; if it
 * does not, then there is no requirement and one can think of FE_Nothing
 * as a function space that is in general discontinuous (i.e., there is
 * no requirement for any kind of continuity at cell interfaces) but on
 * every cell equal to zero.
 *
 * A constructor argument denotes whether the element should be considered
 * dominating or not. The default is for it not to dominate, i.e.,
 * FE_Nothing is treated as a discontinuous element.
 *
 *
 * <h3>FE_Nothing in the context of hanging nodes</h3>
 *
 * Note that some care must be taken that the resulting mesh topology
 * continues to make sense when FE_Nothing elements are introduced. This is
 * particularly true when dealing with hanging node constraints, because the
 * library makes some basic assumptions about the nature of those constraints.
 * The following geometries are acceptable:
 * @code
 * +---------+----+----+
 * |         | 0  |    |
 * |    1    +----+----+
 * |         | 0  |    |
 * +---------+----+----+
 * @endcode
 * @code
 * +---------+----+----+
 * |         | 1  |    |
 * |    0    +----+----+
 * |         | 1  |    |
 * +---------+----+----+
 * @endcode
 * Here, 0 denotes an FE_Nothing cell, and 1 denotes some other element type.
 * The library has no difficulty computing the necessary hanging node
 * constraints in these cases (i.e. no constraint). However, the following
 * geometry is NOT acceptable (at least in the current implementation):
 * @code
 * +---------+----+----+
 * |         | 0  |    |
 * |    1    +----+----+
 * |         | 1  |    |
 * +---------+----+----+
 * @endcode
 * The distinction lies in the mixed nature of the child faces, a case we have
 * not implemented as of yet.
