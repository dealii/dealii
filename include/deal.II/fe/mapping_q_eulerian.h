/**
 * This class is an extension of the MappingQ1Eulerian class to higher order
 * $Q_p$ mappings.  It is useful when one wants to calculate shape function
 * information on a domain that is deforming as the computation proceeds.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * The constructor of this class takes three arguments: the polynomial degree
 * of the desired Qp mapping, a reference to the vector that defines the
 * mapping from the initial configuration to the current configuration, and a
 * reference to the DoFHandler. The most common case is to use the solution
 * vector for the problem under consideration as the shift vector. The key
 * requirement is that the number of components of the given vector field must
 * be equal to (or possibly greater than) the number of space dimensions. If
 * there are more components than space dimensions (for example, if one is
 * working with a coupled problem where there are additional solution
 * variables), the first <tt>dim</tt> components are assumed to represent the
 * displacement field, and the remaining components are ignored.  If this
 * assumption does not hold one may need to set up a separate DoFHandler on
 * the triangulation and associate the desired shift vector to it.
 *
 * Typically, the DoFHandler operates on a finite element that is constructed
 * as a system element (FESystem) from continuous FE_Q objects. An example
 * is shown below:
 * @code
 *    FESystem<dim> fe(FE_Q<dim>(2), dim, FE_Q<dim>(1), 1);
 *    DoFHandler<dim> dof_handler(triangulation);
 *    dof_handler.distribute_dofs(fe);
 *    Vector<double> displacement_field(dof_handler.n_dofs());
 *    // ... compute displacement field somehow...
 *    MappingQEulerian<dim> q2_mapping(2, dof_handler, displacement_field);
 * @endcode
 *
 * In this example, our element consists of <tt>(dim+1)</tt> components. Only
 * the first <tt>dim</tt> components will be used, however, to define the Q2
 * mapping.  The remaining components are ignored.
 *
 * Note that it is essential to call the distribute_dofs(...) function before
 * constructing a mapping object.
 *
 * Also note that since the vector of shift values and the dof handler are
 * only associated to this object at construction time, you have to make sure
 * that whenever you use this object, the given objects still represent valid
 * data.
 *
 * To enable the use of the MappingQEulerian class also in the context of
 * parallel codes using the PETSc or Trilinos wrapper classes, the type
 * of the vector can be specified as template parameter <tt>VectorType</tt>.
