/**
 * This class provides an interface to group several elements together into
 * one. To the outside world, the resulting object looks just like a usual
 * finite element object, which is composed of several other finite elements
 * that are possibly of different type. The result is then a vector-valued
 * finite element. %Vector valued elements are discussed in a number of
 * tutorial programs, for example step-8, step-20, step-21, and in particular
 * in the
 * @ref vector_valued
 * module.
 *
 * @dealiiVideoLecture{19,20}
 *
 * <h3>FESystem, components and blocks</h3>
 *
 * An FESystem, except in the most trivial case, produces a vector-valued
 * finite element with several components. The number of components
 * n_components() corresponds to the dimension of the solution function in the
 * PDE system, and correspondingly also to the number of equations your PDE
 * system has. For example, the mixed Laplace system covered in step-20 has
 * $d+1$ components in $d$ space dimensions: the scalar pressure and the $d$
 * components of the velocity vector. Similarly, the elasticity equation
 * covered in step-8 has $d$ components in $d$ space dimensions. In general,
 * the number of components of a FESystem element is the accumulated number of
 * components of all base elements times their multiplicities. A bit more on
 * components is also given in the
 * @ref GlossComponent "glossary entry on components".
 *
 * While the concept of components is important from the viewpoint of a
 * partial differential equation, the finite element side looks a bit
 * different Since not only FESystem, but also vector-valued elements like
 * FE_RaviartThomas, have several components. The concept needed here is a
 * @ref GlossBlock "block".
 * Each block encompasses the set of degrees of freedom associated with a
 * single base element of an FESystem, where base elements with multiplicities
 * count multiple times. These blocks are usually addressed using the
 * information in DoFHandler::block_info(). The number of blocks of a FESystem
 * object is simply the sum of all multiplicities of base elements and is
 * given by n_blocks().
 *
 * For example, the FESystem for the Taylor-Hood element for the three-
 * dimensional Stokes problem can be built using the code
 *
 * @code
 * FE_Q<3> u(2);
 * FE_Q<3> p(1);
 * FESystem<3> sys1(u,3, p,1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This example creates an FESystem @p sys1 with four components, three for
 * the velocity components and one for the pressure, and also four blocks with
 * the degrees of freedom of each of the velocity components and the pressure
 * in a separate block each. The number of blocks is four since the first base
 * element is repeated three times.
 *
 * On the other hand, a Taylor-Hood element can also be constructed using
 *
 * @code
 * FESystem<3> U(u,3);
 * FESystem<3> sys2(U,1, p,1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The FESystem @p sys2 created here has the same four components, but the
 * degrees of freedom are distributed into only two blocks. The first block
 * has all velocity degrees of freedom from @p U, while the second block
 * contains the pressure degrees of freedom. Note that while @p U itself has 3
 * blocks, the FESystem @p sys2 does not attempt to split @p U into its base
 * elements but considers it a block of its own. By blocking all velocities
 * into one system first as in @p sys2, we achieve the same block structure
 * that would be generated if instead of using a $Q_2^3$ element for the
 * velocities we had used vector-valued base elements, for instance like using
 * a mixed discretization of Darcy's law using
 *
 * @code
 * FE_RaviartThomas<3> u(1);
 * FE_DGQ<3> p(1);
 * FESystem<3> sys3(u,1, p,1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This example also produces a system with four components, but only two
 * blocks.
 *
 * In most cases, the composed element behaves as if it were a usual element.
 * It just has more degrees of freedom than most of the "common" elements.
 * However the underlying structure is visible in the restriction,
 * prolongation and interface constraint matrices, which do not couple the
 * degrees of freedom of the base elements. E.g. the continuity requirement is
 * imposed for the shape functions of the subobjects separately; no
 * requirement exist between shape functions of different subobjects, i.e. in
 * the above example: on a hanging node, the respective value of the @p u
 * velocity is only coupled to @p u at the vertices and the line on the larger
 * cell next to this vertex, but there is no interaction with @p v and @p w of
 * this or the other cell.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Internal information on numbering of degrees of freedom</h3>
 *
 * The overall numbering of degrees of freedom is as follows: for each
 * subobject (vertex, line, quad, or hex), the degrees of freedom are numbered
 * such that we run over all subelements first, before turning for the next
 * dof on this subobject or for the next subobject. For example, for an
 * element of three components in one space dimension, the first two
 * components being cubic lagrange elements and the third being a quadratic
 * lagrange element, the ordering for the system <tt>s=(u,v,p)</tt> is:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> First vertex: <tt>u0, v0, p0 = s0, s1, s2</tt>
 * <li> Second vertex: <tt>u1, v1, p1 = s3, s4, s5</tt>
 * <li> First component on the line: <tt>u2, u3 = s4, s5</tt>
 * <li> Second component on the line: <tt>v2, v3 = s6, s7</tt>.
 * <li> Third component on the line: <tt>p2 = s8</tt>.
 * </ul>
 * That said, you should not rely on this numbering in your application as
 * these %internals might change in future. Rather use the functions
 * system_to_component_index() and component_to_system_index().
 *
 * For more information on the template parameter <tt>spacedim</tt> see the
 * documentation of Triangulation.

   * corresponds to this line, but this does not matter because FESystem
   * creates its own copy of the FE_Q object.

  /**
   * Same as above but for any number of base elements. Pointers to the base
   * elements and their multiplicities are passed as vectors to this
   * constructor. The lengths of these vectors are assumed to be equal.
   *
   * As above, the finite element objects pointed to by the first argument are
   * not actually used other than to create copies internally. Consequently,
   * you can delete these pointers immediately again after calling this
   * constructor.
   *
   * <h4>How to use this constructor</h4>
   *
   * Using this constructor is a bit awkward at times because you need to pass
   * two vectors in a place where it may not be straightforward to construct
   * such a vector -- for example, in the member initializer list of a class
   * with an FESystem member variable. For example, if your main class looks
   * like this:
   * @code
   *   template <int dim>
   *   class MySimulator {
   *   public:
   *     MySimulator (const unsigned int polynomial_degree);
   *   private:
   *     FESystem<dim> fe;
   *   };
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   MySimulator<dim>::MySimulator (const unsigned int polynomial_degree)
   *     :
   *     fe (...)  // what to pass here???
   *   {}
   * @endcode
   *
   * If your compiler supports the C++11 language standard (or later) and
   * deal.II has been configured to use it, then you could do something like
   * this to create an element with four base elements and multiplicities 1,
   * 2, 3 and 4:
   * @code
   *   template <int dim>
   *   MySimulator<dim>::MySimulator (const unsigned int polynomial_degree)
   *     :
   *     fe (std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*> { new FE_Q<dim>(1),
   *                                                  new FE_Q<dim>(2),
   *                                                  new FE_Q<dim>(3),
   *                                                  new FE_Q<dim>(4) },
   *         std::vector<unsigned int> { 1, 2, 3, 4 })
   *   {}
   * @endcode
   * This creates two vectors in place and initializes them using the
   * initializer list enclosed in braces <code>{ ... }</code>.
   *
   * This code has a problem: it creates four memory leaks because the first
   * vector above is created with pointers to elements that are allocated with
   * <code>new</code> but never destroyed. Without C++11, you have another
   * problem: brace-initializer don't exist in earlier C++ standards.
   *
   * The solution to the second of these problems is to create two static
   * member functions that can create vectors. Here is an example:
   * @code
   *   template <int dim>
   *   class MySimulator {
   *   public:
   *     MySimulator (const unsigned int polynomial_degree);
   *
   *   private:
   *     FESystem<dim> fe;
   *
   *     static std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*>
   *     create_fe_list (const unsigned int polynomial_degree);
   *
   *     static std::vector<unsigned int>
   *     create_fe_multiplicities ();
   *   };
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*>
   *   MySimulator<dim>::create_fe_list (const unsigned int polynomial_degree)
   *   {
   *     std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*> fe_list;
   *     fe_list.push_back (new FE_Q<dim>(1));
   *     fe_list.push_back (new FE_Q<dim>(2));
   *     fe_list.push_back (new FE_Q<dim>(3));
   *     fe_list.push_back (new FE_Q<dim>(4));
   *     return fe_list;
   *   }
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   std::vector<unsigned int>
   *   MySimulator<dim>::create_fe_multiplicities ()
   *   {
   *     std::vector<unsigned int> multiplicities;
   *     multiplicities.push_back (1);
   *     multiplicities.push_back (2);
   *     multiplicities.push_back (3);
   *     multiplicities.push_back (4);
   *     return multiplicities;
   *   }
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   MySimulator<dim>::MySimulator (const unsigned int polynomial_degree)
   *     :
   *     fe (create_fe_list (polynomial_degree),
   *         create_fe_multiplicities ())
   *   {}
   * @endcode
   *
   * The way this works is that we have two static member functions that
   * create the necessary vectors to pass to the constructor of the member
   * variable <code>fe</code>. They need to be static because they are called
   * during the constructor of <code>MySimulator</code> at a time when the
   * <code>*this</code> object isn't fully constructed and, consequently,
   * regular member functions cannot be called yet.
   *
   * The code above does not solve the problem with the memory leak yet,
   * though: the <code>create_fe_list()</code> function creates a vector of
   * pointers, but nothing destroys these. This is the solution:
   * @code
   *   template <int dim>
   *   class MySimulator {
   *   public:
   *     MySimulator (const unsigned int polynomial_degree);
   *
   *   private:
   *     FESystem<dim> fe;
   *
   *     struct VectorElementDestroyer {
   *       const std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*> data;
   *       VectorElementDestroyer (const std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*> &pointers);
   *       ~VectorElementDestroyer (); // destructor to delete the pointers
   *       const std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*> & get_data () const;
   *     };
   *
   *     static std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*>
   *     create_fe_list (const unsigned int polynomial_degree);
   *
   *     static std::vector<unsigned int>
   *     create_fe_multiplicities ();
   *   };
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   MySimulator<dim>::VectorElementDestroyer::
   *   VectorElementDestroyer (const std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*> &pointers)
   *     : data(pointers)
   *   {}
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   MySimulator<dim>::VectorElementDestroyer::
   *   ~VectorElementDestroyer ()
   *   {
   *     for (unsigned int i=0; i<data.size(); ++i)
   *       delete data[i];
   *   }
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   const std::vector<const FiniteElement<dim>*> &
   *   MySimulator<dim>::VectorElementDestroyer::
   *   get_data () const
   *   {
   *     return data;
   *   }
   *
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   MySimulator<dim>::MySimulator (const unsigned int polynomial_degree)
   *     :
   *     fe (VectorElementDestroyer(create_fe_list (polynomial_degree)).get_data(),
   *         create_fe_multiplicities ())
   *   {}
   * @endcode
   *
   * In other words, the vector we receive from the
   * <code>create_fe_list()</code> is packed into a temporary object of type
   * <code>VectorElementDestroyer</code>; we then get the vector from this
   * temporary object immediately to pass it to the constructor of
   * <code>fe</code>; and finally, the <code>VectorElementDestroyer</code>
   * destructor is called at the end of the entire expression (after the
   * constructor of <code>fe</code> has finished) and destroys the elements of
   * the temporary vector. Voila: not short nor elegant, but it works!
