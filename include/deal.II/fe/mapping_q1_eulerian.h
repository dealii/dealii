/**
 * Eulerian mapping of general unit cells by d-linear shape functions. Each
 * cell is thus shifted in space by values given to the mapping through a
 * finite element field.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * The constructor of this class takes two arguments: a reference to the
 * vector that defines the mapping from the reference configuration to the
 * current configuration and a reference to the DoFHandler. The vector should
 * then represent a (flattened out version of a) vector valued field defined
 * at nodes defined by the the DoFHandler, where the number of components of
 * the vector field equals the number of space dimensions. Thus, the
 * DoFHandler shall operate on a finite element that has as many components as
 * space dimensions. As an additional requirement, we impose that it have as
 * many degree of freedom per vertex as there are space dimensions; since this
 * object only evaluates the finite element field at the vertices, the values
 * of all other degrees of freedom (not associated to vertices) are ignored.
 * These requirements are met if the finite element which the given DoFHandler
 * operates on is constructed as a system element (FESystem) from @p dim
 * continuous FE_Q() objects.
 *
 * In many cases, the shift vector will also be the solution vector of the
 * problem under investigation. If this is not the case (i.e. the number of
 * components of the solution variable is not equal to the space dimension,
 * e.g. for scalar problems in <tt>dim>1</tt> where the Eulerian coordinates
 * only give a background field) or for coupled problems where more variables
 * are computed than just the flow field), then a different DoFHandler has to
 * be set up on the given triangulation, and the shift vector has then to be
 * associated to it.
 *
 * An example is shown below:
 * @code
 *    FESystem<dim> fe(FE_Q<dim>(1), dim);
 *    DoFHandler<dim> flowfield_dof_handler(triangulation);
 *    flowfield_dof_handler.distribute_dofs(fe);
 *    Vector<double> map_points(flowfield_dof_handler.n_dofs());
 *    MappingQ1Eulerian<dim> mymapping(map_points, flowfield_dof_handler);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that since the vector of shift values and the dof handler are only
 * associated to this object at construction time, you have to make sure that
 * whenever you use this object, the given objects still represent valid data.
 *
 * To enable the use of the MappingQ1Eulerian class also in the context of
 * parallel codes using the PETSc wrapper classes, the type of the vector can
 * be specified as template parameter <tt>EulerVectorType</tt> Not specifying
 * this template argument in applications using the PETSc vector classes leads
 * to the construction of a copy of the vector which is not acccessible
 * afterwards!
 *
 * For more information about the <tt>spacedim</tt> template parameter check
 * the documentation of FiniteElement or the one of Triangulation.
