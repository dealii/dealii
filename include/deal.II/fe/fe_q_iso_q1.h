/**
 * Implementation of a scalar Lagrange finite element @p Qp-iso-Q1 that
 * defines the finite element space of continuous, piecewise linear elements
 * with @p p subdivisions in each coordinate direction. It yields an element
 * with the same number of degrees of freedom as the @p Qp elements but using
 * linear interpolation instead of higher order one. This type of element is
 * also called macro element in the literature as it really consists of
 * several smaller elements, namely <i>p</i><tt><sup>dim</sup></tt> such
 * sub-cells.
 *
 * The numbering of degrees of freedom is done in exactly the same way as in
 * FE_Q of degree @p p. See there for a detailed description on how degrees of
 * freedom are numbered within one element.
 *
 * This element represents a Q-linear finite element space on a reduced mesh
 * size <i>h/p</i>. Its effect is equivalent to using FE_Q of degree one on a
 * finer mesh by a factor @p p if an equivalent quadrature is used. However,
 * this element reduces the flexibility in the choice of (adaptive) mesh size
 * by exactly this factor @p p, which typically reduces efficiency. On the
 * other hand, comparing this element with @p p subdivisions to the FE_Q
 * element of degree @p p on the same mesh shows that the convergence is
 * typically much worse for smooth problems. In particular, @p Qp elements
 * achieve interpolation orders of <i>h<sup>p+1</sup></i> in the L2 norm,
 * whereas these elements reach only <i>(h/p)<sup>2</sup></i>. For these two
 * reasons, this element is usually not very useful as a standalone. In
 * addition, any evaluation of face terms on the boundaries within the
 * elements becomes impossible with this element because deal.II does not
 * have the equivalent of FEFaceValues for lower-dimensional integrals
 * in the interior of cells.
 *
 * Nonetheless, there are a few use cases where this element actually is
 * useful:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> Systems of PDEs where certain variables demand for higher resolutions
 * than the others and the additional degrees of freedom should be spent on
 * increasing the resolution of linears instead of higher order polynomials,
 * and you do not want to use two different meshes for the different
 * components. This can be the case when irregularities (shocks) appear in the
 * solution and stabilization techniques are used that work for linears but
 * not higher order elements. </li>
 *
 * <li> Stokes/Navier Stokes systems such as the one discussed in step-22 could be
 * solved with Q2-iso-Q1 elements for velocities instead of Q2 elements.
 * Combined with Q1 pressures they give a stable mixed element pair. However,
 * they perform worse than the standard (Taylor-Hood $Q_2\times Q_1$)
 * approach in most situations.  </li>
 *
 * <li> Preconditioning systems of FE_Q systems of higher order @p p with a
 * preconditioner based on @p Qp-iso-Q1 elements: Some preconditioners like
 * algebraic multigrid perform much better with linear elements than with
 * higher order elements because they often implicitly assume a sparse
 * connectivity between entries. Then, creating a preconditioner matrix based
 * on these elements yields the same number of degrees of freedom (and a
 * spectrally equivalent linear system), which can be combined with a (high
 * order) system matrix in an iterative solver like CG.  </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Appropriate integration</h3>
 *
 * Due to the nature of these elements as a concatenation of linears, care
 * must be taken when selecting quadrature formulas for this element. The
 * standard choice for an element of @p p subelements is a formula
 * <tt>QIterated<dim>(QGauss<1>(2), p)</tt>, which corresponds to the formula
 * that would be used for integrating functions on a finer mesh. This is in
 * contrast with FE_Q(p) where QGauss<dim>(p+1) is the default choice. In
 * particular, care must be taken to not use a quadrature formula that
 * evaluates the basis functions (and their derivatives) on sub-element
 * boundaries as the gradients of piecewiese functions on internal boundaries
 * are set to zero. No checks are performed internally to ensure that this is
 * not the case - it is the user's responsibility to avoid these situations.
 *
 * Also note that the usual deal.II routines for setting up sparsity patterns
 * and assembling matrices do not make use of the increased sparsity in this
 * element compared to FE_Q. This is because DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern
 * assumes coupling between all degrees of freedom within the element, whereas
 * FE_Q_iso_Q1 with more than one subdivision does have less coupling.
