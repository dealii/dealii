/**
 * A class that implements a polynomial mapping $Q_p$ of degree $p$ on cells
 * at the boundary of the domain (or, if requested in the constructor, for all
 * cells) and linear mappings for interior cells.
 *
 * The class is in fact poorly named since (unless explicitly specified during
 * the construction of the object, see below), it does not actually use
 * mappings of degree $p$ <i>everywhere</i>, but only on cells at the
 * boundary. This is in contrast to the MappingQGeneric class which indeed
 * does use a polynomial mapping $Q_p$ of degree $p$ everywhere. The point of
 * the current class is that in many situations, curved domains are only
 * provided with information about how exactly edges at the boundary are
 * shaped, but we do not know anything about internal edges. Thus, in the
 * absence of other information, we can only assume that internal edges are
 * straight lines, and in that case internal cells may as well be treated is
 * bilinear quadrilaterals or trilinear hexahedra. (An example of how such
 * meshes look is shown in step-1 already, but it is also discussed in the
 * "Results" section of step-6.) Because bi-/trilinear mappings are
 * significantly cheaper to compute than higher order mappings, it is
 * advantageous in such situations to use the higher order mapping only on
 * cells at the boundary of the domain. This class implements exactly this
 * behavior.
 *
 * There are a number of special cases worth considering:
 * - If you want to use a higher order mapping for all cells, you can
 * achieve this by setting the second argument to the constructor to true.
 * This only makes sense if you can actually provide information about how
 * interior edges and faces of the mesh should be curved. This is typically
 * done by associating a Manifold with interior cells and edges. A simple
 * example of this is discussed in the "Results" section of step-6; a full
 * discussion of manifolds is provided in step-53.
 * - If you pass true as the second argument to this class, then it
 * is in fact completely equivalent to generating a MappingQGeneric object
 * right away.
 * - This class is also entirely equivalent to MappingQGeneric if the
 * polynomial degree provided is one. This is because in that case, no
 * distinction between the mapping used on cells in the interior and on the
 * boundary of the domain can be made.
 * - If you are working on meshes embedded in higher space dimensions,
 * i.e., if dim!=spacedim, then every cell is considered to be at the boundary
 * of the domain and consequently a higher order mapping is used for all
 * cells; again this class is then equivalent to using MappingQGeneric right
 * away.
 *
 * <h4>Behavior along curved boundaries and with different manifolds</h4>
 *
 * For the behavior of the mapping and convergence rates in case of mixing
 * different manifolds, please consult the respective section of
 * MappingQGeneric.

   * The second argument determines whether the higher order mapping should

   * better approximate the boundary. In that case, cells bounded by straight
   * lines are acceptable in the interior. However, there are cases where one
