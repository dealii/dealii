/**
 * This class implements the functionality for polynomial mappings $Q_p$ of
 * polynomial degree $p$ that will be used on all cells of the mesh.  In order
 * to get a genuine higher-order mapping for all cells, it is important to
 * provide information about how interior edges and faces of the mesh should
 * be curved. This is typically done by associating a Manifold with interior
 * cells and edges. A simple example of this is discussed in the "Results"
 * section of step-6; a full discussion of manifolds is provided in
 * step-53. If manifolds are only attached to the boundaries of a domain, the
 * current class with higher polynomial degrees will provide the same
 * information as a mere MappingQ1 object. If you are working on meshes that
 * describe a (curved) manifold embedded in higher space dimensions, i.e., if
 * dim!=spacedim, then every cell is at the boundary of the domain you will
 * likely already have attached a manifold object to all cells that can then
 * also be used by the mapping classes for higher order mappings.
 *
 * <h4>Behavior along curved boundaries and with different manifolds</h4>
 *
 * For a number of applications, one only knows a manifold description of a
 * surface but not the interior of the computational domain. In such a case, a
 * FlatManifold object will be assigned to the interior entities that
 * describes a usual planar coordinate system where the additional points for
 * the higher order mapping are placed exactly according to a bi-/trilinear
 * mapping. When combined with a non-flat manifold on the boundary, for
 * example a circle bulging into the interior of a square cell, the two
 * manifold descriptions are in general incompatible. For example, a
 * FlatManifold defined solely through the cell's vertices would put an
 * interior point located at some small distance epsilon away from the
 * boundary along a straight line and thus in general outside the concave part
 * of a circle. If the polynomial degree of MappingQ is sufficiently high, the
 * transformation from the reference cell to such a cell would in general
 * contain inverted regions close to the boundary.
 *
 * In order to avoid this situation, this class applies an algorithm for
 * making this transition smooth using a so-called transfinite interpolation
 * that is essentially a linear blend between the descriptions along the
 * surrounding entities. In the algorithm that computes additional points, the
 * compute_mapping_support_points() method, all the entities of the cells are
 * passed through hierarchically, starting from the lines to the quads and
 * finally hexes. Points on objects higher up in the hierarchy are obtained
 * from the manifold associated with that object, taking into account all the
 * points previously computed by the manifolds associated with the
 * lower-dimensional objects, not just the vertices. If only a line is
 * assigned a curved boundary but the adjacent quad is on a flat manifold, the
 * flat manifold on the quad will take the points on the deformed line into
 * account when interpolating the position of the additional points inside the
 * quad and thus always result in a well-defined transformation.
 *
 * The interpolation scheme used in this class makes sure that curved
 * descriptions can go over to flat descriptions within a single layer of
 * elements, maintaining the overall optimal convergence rates of the finite
 * element interpolation. However, this only helps as long as opposite faces
 * of a cell are far enough away from each other: If a curved part is indeed
 * curved to the extent that it would come close or even intersect some of the
 * other faces, as is often the case with long and sliver cells, the current
 * approach still leads to bad mesh quality. Therefore, the recommended way is
 * to spread the transition between curved boundaries and flat interior
 * domains over a larger range as the mesh is refined. This is provided by the
 * special manifold TransfiniteInterpolationManifold.

   * support points.
   *

   * given cell) via the support points on the line (for which it calls the
   * add_line_support_points() function) and the support points on the quad
   * faces (in 3d, for which it calls the add_quad_support_points() function).
   * It then adds interior support points that are either computed by
   * interpolation from the surrounding points using weights for transfinite
   * interpolation, or if dim<spacedim, it asks the underlying manifold for
   * the locations of interior points.
