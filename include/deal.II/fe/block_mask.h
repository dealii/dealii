/**
 * This class represents a mask that can be used to select individual vector
 * blocks of a finite element (see also
 * @ref GlossBlockMask "this glossary entry").
 * It will typically have as many elements as the finite element has blocks,
 * and one can use <code>operator[]</code> to query whether a particular block
 * has been selected.
 *
 * The semantics of this class are the same as the related ComponentMask
 * class, i.e., a default constructed mask represents all possible blocks. See
 * there for more information about these semantics.
 *
 * Objects of this kind are used in many places where one wants to restrict
 * operations to a certain subset of blocks, e.g. in DoFTools::extract_dofs.
 * These objects can either be created by hand, or, simpler, by asking the
 * finite element to generate a block mask from certain selected blocks using
 * code such as this where we create a mask that only denotes the velocity
 * block of a Stokes element (see
 * @ref vector_valued):
 * @code
 *   FESystem<dim> stokes_fe (FESystem<dim>(FE_Q<dim>(2), dim), 1,    // Q2 element for the velocities
 *                            FE_Q<dim>(1),                     1);     // Q1 element for the pressure
 *   FEValuesExtractors::Scalar pressure(dim);
 *   BlockMask pressure_mask = stokes_fe.block_mask (pressure);
 * @endcode
 * Note that by wrapping the velocity elements into a single FESystem object
 * we make sure that the overall element has only 2 blocks. The result is a
 * block mask that, in both 2d and 3d, would have values <code>[false,
 * true]</code>. (Compare this to the corresponding component mask discussed
 * in the ComponentMask documentation.) Similarly, using
 * @code
 *   FEValuesExtractors::Vector velocities(0);
 *   BlockMask velocity_mask = stokes_fe.block_mask (velocities);
 * @endcode
 * would result in a mask <code>[true, false]</code> in both 2d and 3d.
