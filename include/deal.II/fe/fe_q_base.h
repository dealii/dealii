   * under consideration, or can be flipped, oriented, etc.
   *
   * @param face_dof_index The index of the degree of freedom on a face. This
   * index must be between zero and dofs_per_face.
   * @param face The number of the face this degree of freedom lives on. This
   * number must be between zero and GeometryInfo::faces_per_cell.
   * @param face_orientation One part of the description of the orientation of
   * the face. See
   * @ref GlossFaceOrientation.
   * @param face_flip One part of the description of the orientation of the
   * face. See
   * @ref GlossFaceOrientation.
