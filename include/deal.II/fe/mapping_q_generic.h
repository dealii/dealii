/**
 * This class implements the functionality for polynomial mappings $Q_p$ of
 * polynomial degree $p$ that will be used on all cells of the mesh. The
 * MappingQ1 and MappingQ classes specialize this behavior slightly.
 *
 * The class is poorly named. It should really have been called MappingQ
 * because it consistently uses $Q_p$ mappings on all cells of a
 * triangulation. However, the name MappingQ was already taken when we rewrote
 * the entire class hierarchy for mappings. One might argue that one should
 * always use MappingQGeneric over the existing class MappingQ (which, unless
 * explicitly specified during the construction of the object, only uses
 * mappings of degree $p$ <i>on cells at the boundary of the domain</i>). On
 * the other hand, there are good reasons to use MappingQ in many situations:
 * in many situations, curved domains are only provided with information about
 * how exactly edges at the boundary are shaped, but we do not know anything
 * about internal edges. Thus, in the absence of other information, we can
 * only assume that internal edges are straight lines, and in that case
 * internal cells may as well be treated is bilinear quadrilaterals or
 * trilinear hexahedra. (An example of how such meshes look is shown in step-1
 * already, but it is also discussed in the "Results" section of step-6.)
 * Because bi-/trilinear mappings are significantly cheaper to compute than
 * higher order mappings, it is advantageous in such situations to use the
 * higher order mapping only on cells at the boundary of the domain -- i.e.,
 * the behavior of MappingQ. Of course, MappingQGeneric also uses bilinear
 * mappings for interior cells as long as it has no knowledge about curvature
 * of interior edges, but it implements this the expensive way: as a general
 * $Q_p$ mapping where the mapping support points just <i>happen</i> to be
 * arranged along linear or bilinear edges or faces.
 *
 * There are a number of special cases worth considering:
 * - If you really want to use a higher order mapping for all cells,
 * you can do this using the current class, but this only makes sense if you
 * can actually provide information about how interior edges and faces of the
 * mesh should be curved. This is typically done by associating a Manifold
 * with interior cells and edges. A simple example of this is discussed in the
 * "Results" section of step-6; a full discussion of manifolds is provided in
 * step-53.
 * - If you are working on meshes that describe a (curved) manifold
 * embedded in higher space dimensions, i.e., if dim!=spacedim, then every
 * cell is at the boundary of the domain you will likely already have attached
 * a manifold object to all cells that can then also be used by the mapping
 * classes for higher order mappings.
 *
 * <h4>Behavior along curved boundaries and with different manifolds</h4>
 *
 * As described above, one often only knows a manifold description of a
 * surface but not the interior of the computational domain. In such a case, a
 * FlatManifold object will be assigned to the interior entities that
 * describes a usual planar coordinate system where the additional points for
 * the higher order mapping are placed exactly according to a bi-/trilinear
 * mapping. When combined with a non-flat manifold on the boundary, for
 * example a circle bulging into the interior of a square cell, the two
 * manifold descriptions are in general incompatible. For example, a
 * FlatManifold defined solely through the cell's vertices would put an
 * interior point located at some small distance epsilon away from the
 * boundary along a straight line and thus in general outside the concave part
 * of a circle. If the polynomial degree of MappingQ is sufficiently high, the
 * transformation from the reference cell to such a cell would in general
 * contain inverted regions close to the boundary.
 *
 * In order to avoid this situation, this class applies an algorithm for
 * making this transition smooth using a so-called transfinite interpolation
 * that is essentially a linear blend between the descriptions along the
 * surrounding entities. In the algorithm that computes additional points, the
 * compute_mapping_support_points() method, all the entities of the cells are
 * passed through hierarchically, starting from the lines to the quads and
 * finally hexes. Points on objects higher up in the hierarchy are obtained
 * from the manifold associated with that object, taking into account all the
 * points previously computed by the manifolds associated with the
 * lower-dimensional objects, not just the vertices. If only a line is
 * assigned a curved boundary but the adjacent quad is on a flat manifold, the
 * flat manifold on the quad will take the points on the deformed line into
 * account when interpolating the position of the additional points inside the
 * quad and thus always result in a well-defined transformation.
 *
 * The interpolation scheme used in this class makes sure that curved
 * descriptions can go over to flat descriptions within a single layer of
 * elements, maintaining the overall optimal convergence rates of the finite
 * element interpolation. However, one does often get better solution
 * qualities if the transition between curved boundaries and flat interior
 * domains is spread over a larger range as the mesh is refined. This is
 * provided by the special manifold TransfiniteInterpolationManifold.

   * add_line_support_points() function) and the support points on the quad
   * faces (in 3d, for which it calls the add_quad_support_points() function).
   * It then adds interior support points that are either computed by
   * interpolation from the surrounding points using weights for transfinite
   * interpolation, or if dim<spacedim, it asks the underlying manifold for
   * the locations of interior points.
