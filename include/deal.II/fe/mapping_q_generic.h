/**
 * This class implements the functionality for polynomial mappings $Q_p$ of
 * polynomial degree $p$ that will be used on all cells of the mesh. The
 * MappingQ1 and MappingQ classes specialize this behavior slightly.
 *
 * The class is poorly named. It should really have been called MappingQ
 * because it consistently uses $Q_p$ mappings on all cells of a
 * triangulation. However, the name MappingQ was already taken when we rewrote
 * the entire class hierarchy for mappings. One might argue that one should
 * always use MappingQGeneric over the existing class MappingQ (which, unless
 * explicitly specified during the construction of the object, only uses
 * mappings of degree $p$ <i>on cells at the boundary of the domain</i>). On
 * the other hand, there are good reasons to use MappingQ in many situations:
 * in many situations, curved domains are only provided with information about
 * how exactly edges at the boundary are shaped, but we do not know anything
 * about internal edges. Thus, in the absence of other information, we can
 * only assume that internal edges are straight lines, and in that case
 * internal cells may as well be treated is bilinear quadrilaterals or
 * trilinear hexahedra. (An example of how such meshes look is shown in step-1
 * already, but it is also discussed in the "Results" section of step-6.)
 * Because bi-/trilinear mappings are significantly cheaper to compute than
 * higher order mappings, it is advantageous in such situations to use the
 * higher order mapping only on cells at the boundary of the domain -- i.e.,
 * the behavior of MappingQ. Of course, MappingQGeneric also uses bilinear
 * mappings for interior cells as long as it has no knowledge about curvature
 * of interior edges, but it implements this the expensive way: as a general
 * $Q_p$ mapping where the mapping support points just <i>happen</i> to be
 * arranged along linear or bilinear edges or faces.
 *
 * There are a number of special cases worth considering:
 * - If you really want to use a higher order mapping for all cells,
 * you can do this using the current class, but this only makes sense if you
 * can actually provide information about how interior edges and faces of the
 * mesh should be curved. This is typically done by associating a Manifold
 * with interior cells and edges. A simple example of this is discussed in the
 * "Results" section of step-6; a full discussion of manifolds is provided in
 * step-53.
 * - If you are working on meshes that describe a (curved) manifold
 * embedded in higher space dimensions, i.e., if dim!=spacedim, then every
 * cell is at the boundary of the domain you will likely already have attached
 * a manifold object to all cells that can then also be used by the mapping
 * classes for higher order mappings.
