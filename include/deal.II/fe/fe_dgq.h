/**
 * Implementation of scalar, discontinuous tensor product elements based on
 * equidistant support points.
 *
 * This is a discontinuous finite element based on tensor products of
 * Lagrangian polynomials. The shape functions are Lagrangian interpolants of
 * an equidistant grid of points on the unit cell. The points are numbered in
 * lexicographical order, with <i>x</i> running fastest, then <i>y</i>, then
 * <i>z</i> (if these coordinates are present for a given space dimension at
 * all). For example, these are the node orderings for <tt>FE_DGQ(1)</tt> in
 * 3d:
 *  @verbatim
 *         6-------7        6-------7
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *       / |       |      /       / |
 *      /  |       |     /       /  |
 *     4   |       |    4-------5   |

 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     0-------1        0-------1
 *  @endverbatim
 * and <tt>FE_DGQ(2)</tt>:
 *  @verbatim
 *         24--25--26       24--25--26
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *      21 |       |     21  22  23 |
 *      /  15  16  17    /       /  17
 *    18   |       |   18--19--20   |
 *     |12 6---7---8    |       |14 8
 *     9  /       /     9  10  11  /
 *     | 3   4   5      |       | 5

 *     0---1---2        0---1---2
 *  @endverbatim
 * with node 13 being placed in the interior of the hex.
 *
 * Note, however, that these are just the Lagrange interpolation points of the
 * shape functions. Even though they may physically be on the boundary of the
 * cell, they are logically in the interior since there are no continuity
 * requirements for these shape functions across cell boundaries. While
 * discontinuous, when restricted to a single cell the shape functions of this
 * element are exactly the same as those of the FE_Q element where they are
 * shown visually.
 *
 * <h3>Unit support point distribution and conditioning of interpolation</h3>
 *
 * When constructing an FE_DGQ element at polynomial degrees one or two,
 * equidistant support points at 0 and 1 (linear case) or 0, 0.5, and 1
 * (quadratic case) are used. The unit support or nodal points
 * <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> are those points where the <i>j</i>th Lagrange
 * polynomial satisfies the $\delta_{ij}$ property, i.e., where one polynomial
 * is one and all the others are zero.  For higher polynomial degrees, the
 * support points are non-equidistant by default, and chosen to be the support
 * points of the <tt>(degree+1)</tt>-order Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rule. This
 * point distribution yields well-conditioned Lagrange interpolation at
 * arbitrary polynomial degrees. By contrast, polynomials based on equidistant
 * points get increasingly ill-conditioned as the polynomial degree
 * increases. In interpolation, this effect is known as the Runge
 * phenomenon. For Galerkin methods, the Runge phenomenon is typically not
 * visible in the solution quality but rather in the condition number of the
 * associated system matrices. For example, the elemental mass matrix of
 * equidistant points at degree 10 has condition number 2.6e6, whereas the
 * condition number for Gauss-Lobatto points is around 400.
 *
 * The Gauss-Lobatto points in 1D include the end points 0 and +1 of the unit
 * interval. The interior points are shifted towards the end points, which
 * gives a denser point distribution close to the element boundary.
