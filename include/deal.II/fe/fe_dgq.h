/**
 * Implementation of scalar, discontinuous tensor product elements based on
 * equidistant support points.
 *
 * This is a discontinuous finite element based on tensor products of
 * Lagrangian polynomials. The shape functions are Lagrangian interpolants of
 * an equidistant grid of points on the unit cell. The points are numbered in
 * lexicographical order, with <i>x</i> running fastest, then <i>y</i>, then
 * <i>z</i> (if these coordinates are present for a given space dimension at
 * all). For example, these are the node orderings for <tt>FE_DGQ(1)</tt> in
 * 3d:
 *  @verbatim
 *         6-------7        6-------7
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *       / |       |      /       / |
 *      /  |       |     /       /  |
 *     4   |       |    4-------5   |
 *     |   2-------3    |       |   3
 *     |  /       /     |       |  /
 *     | /       /      |       | /
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     0-------1        0-------1
 *  @endverbatim
 * and <tt>FE_DGQ(2)</tt>:
 *  @verbatim
 *         24--25--26       24--25--26
 *        /|       |       /       /|
 *      21 |       |     21  22  23 |
 *      /  15  16  17    /       /  17
 *    18   |       |   18--19--20   |
 *     |12 6---7---8    |       |14 8
 *     9  /       /     9  10  11  /
 *     | 3   4   5      |       | 5
 *     |/       /       |       |/
 *     0---1---2        0---1---2
 *  @endverbatim
 * with node 13 being placed in the interior of the hex.
 *
 * Note, however, that these are just the Lagrange interpolation points of the
 * shape functions. Even though they may physically be on the boundary of the
 * cell, they are logically in the interior since there are no continuity
 * requirements for these shape functions across cell boundaries. While
 * discontinuous, when restricted to a single cell the shape functions of this
 * element are exactly the same as those of the FE_Q element where they are
 * shown visually.
