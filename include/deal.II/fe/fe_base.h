{
  /**
   * An enum that describes the outcome of comparing two elements for mutual
   * domination. If one element dominates another, then the restriction of the
   * space described by the dominated element to a face of the cell is
   * strictly larger than that of the dominating element. For example, in 2-d
   * Q(2) elements dominate Q(4) elements, because the traces of Q(4) elements
   * are quartic polynomials which is a space strictly larger than the
   * quadratic polynomials (the restriction of the Q(2) element). Similar
   * reasonings apply for vertices and cells as well. In general, Q(k) dominates
   * Q(k') if $k\le k'$.
   *
   * This enum is used in the FiniteElement::compare_for_domination() function
   * that is used in the context of hp-finite element methods when determining
   * what to do at faces where two different finite elements meet (see the
   * @ref hp_paper "hp-paper"
   * for a more detailed description of the following). In that case, the
   * degrees of freedom of one side need to be constrained to those on the
   * other side. The determination which side is which is based on the outcome
   * of a comparison for mutual domination: the dominated side is constrained
   * to the dominating one.
   *
   * Note that there are situations where neither side dominates. The
   * @ref hp_paper "hp-paper"
   * lists two case, with the simpler one being that a $Q_2\times Q_1$ vector-
   * valued element (i.e. a <code>FESystem(FE_Q(2),1,FE_Q(1),1)</code>) meets
   * a $Q_1\times Q_2$ element: here, for each of the two vector-components,
   * we can define a domination relationship, but it is different for the two
   * components.
   *
   * It is clear that the concept of domination doesn't matter for
   * discontinuous elements. However, discontinuous elements may be part of
   * vector-valued elements and may therefore be compared against each other
   * for domination. They should return
   * <code>either_element_can_dominate</code> in that case. Likewise, when
   * comparing two identical finite elements, they should return this code;
   * the reason is that we can not decide which element will dominate at the
   * time we look at the first component of, for example, two $Q_2\times Q_1$
   * and $Q_2\times Q_2$ elements, and have to keep our options open until we
   * get to the second base element.
   *
   * Finally, the code no_requirements exists for cases where elements impose
   * no continuity requirements. The case is primarily meant for FE_Nothing
   * which is an element that has no degrees of freedom in a subdomain. It
   * could also be used by discontinuous elements, for example.
   *
   * More details on domination can be found in the
   * @ref hp_paper "hp-paper".

   * (implemented by the FE_Q class) are $H^1$ conforming, whereas the
   * Raviart-Thomas element (implemented by the FE_RaviartThomas class) is
   * $H_\text{div}$ conforming; finally, completely discontinuous elements
   * (implemented by the FE_DGQ class) are only $L_2$ conforming.
   *
   * @param[in] block_indices An argument that describes how the base elements
   * of a finite element are grouped. The default value constructs a single
   * block that consists of all @p dofs_per_cell degrees of freedom. This is
   * appropriate for all "atomic" elements (including non-primitive ones) and
