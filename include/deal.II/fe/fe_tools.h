  /**
   * Projects scalar data defined in quadrature points to a finite element
   * space on a single cell.
   *
   * What this function does is the following: assume that there is scalar
   * data <tt>u<sub>q</sub>, 0 <= q < Q:=quadrature.size()</tt> defined at the
   * quadrature points of a cell, with the points defined by the given
   * <tt>rhs_quadrature</tt> object. We may then want to ask for that finite
   * element function (on a single cell) <tt>v<sub>h</sub></tt> in the finite-
   * dimensional space defined by the given FE object that is the projection
   * of <tt>u</tt> in the following sense:
   *
   * Usually, the projection <tt>v<sub>h</sub></tt> is that function that
   * satisfies <tt>(v<sub>h</sub>,w)=(u,w)</tt> for all discrete test
   * functions <tt>w</tt>. In the present case, we can't evaluate the right
   * hand side, since <tt>u</tt> is only defined in the quadrature points
   * given by <tt>rhs_quadrature</tt>, so we replace it by a quadrature
   * approximation. Likewise, the left hand side is approximated using the
   * <tt>lhs_quadrature</tt> object; if this quadrature object is chosen
   * appropriately, then the integration of the left hand side can be done
   * exactly, without any approximation. The use of different quadrature
   * objects is necessary if the quadrature object for the right hand side has
   * too few quadrature points -- for example, if data <tt>q</tt> is only
   * defined at the cell center, then the corresponding one-point quadrature
   * formula is obviously insufficient to approximate the scalar product on
   * the left hand side by a definite form.
   *
   * After these quadrature approximations, we end up with a nodal
   * representation <tt>V<sub>h</sub></tt> of <tt>v<sub>h</sub></tt> that
   * satisfies the following system of linear equations: <tt>M V<sub>h</sub> =
   * Q U</tt>, where <tt>M<sub>ij</sub>=(phi_i,phi_j)</tt> is the mass matrix
   * approximated by <tt>lhs_quadrature</tt>, and <tt>Q</tt> is the matrix
   * <tt>Q<sub>iq</sub>=phi<sub>i</sub>(x<sub>q</sub>) w<sub>q</sub></tt>
   * where <tt>w<sub>q</sub></tt> are quadrature weights; <tt>U</tt> is the
   * vector of quadrature point data <tt>u<sub>q</sub></tt>.
   *
   * In order to then get the nodal representation <tt>V<sub>h</sub></tt> of
   * the projection of <tt>U</tt>, one computes <tt>V<sub>h</sub> = X U,
   * X=M<sup>-1</sup> Q</tt>. The purpose of this function is to compute the
   * matrix <tt>X</tt> and return it through the last argument of this
   * function.
   *
   * Note that this function presently only supports scalar data. An extension
   * of the mass matrix is of course trivial, but one has to define the order
   * of data in the vector <tt>U</tt> if it contains vector valued data in all
   * quadrature points.
   *
   * A use for this function is described in the introduction to the step-18
   * example program.
   *
   * The opposite of this function, interpolation of a finite element function
   * onto quadrature points is essentially what the
   * <tt>FEValues::get_function_values</tt> functions do; to make things a
   * little simpler, the
   * <tt>FETools::compute_interpolation_to_quadrature_points_matrix</tt>
   * provides the matrix form of this.
   *
   * Note that this function works on a single cell, rather than an entire
   * triangulation. In effect, it therefore doesn't matter if you use a
   * continuous or discontinuous version of the finite element.
   *
   * It is worth noting that there are a few confusing cases of this function.
   * The first one is that it really only makes sense to project onto a finite
   * element that has at most as many degrees of freedom per cell as there are
   * quadrature points; the projection of N quadrature point data into a space
   * with M>N unknowns is well-defined, but often yields funny and non-
   * intuitive results. Secondly, one would think that if the quadrature point
   * data is defined in the support points of the finite element, i.e. the
   * quadrature points of <tt>ths_quadrature</tt> equal
   * <tt>fe.get_unit_support_points()</tt>, then the projection should be the
   * identity, i.e. each degree of freedom of the finite element equals the
   * value of the given data in the support point of the corresponding shape
   * function. However, this is not generally the case: while the matrix
   * <tt>Q</tt> in that case is the identity matrix, the mass matrix
   * <tt>M</tt> is not equal to the identity matrix, except for the special
   * case that the quadrature formula <tt>lhs_quadrature</tt> also has its
   * quadrature points in the support points of the finite element.
   *
   * Finally, this function only defines a cell wise projection, while one
   * frequently wants to apply it to all cells in a triangulation. However, if
   * it is applied to one cell after the other, the results from later cells
   * may overwrite nodal values computed already from previous cells if
   * degrees of freedom live on the interfaces between cells. The function is
   * therefore most useful for discontinuous elements.

   *
   * For this case (continuous elements on grids with hanging nodes), please
   * use the @p interpolate() function with an additional ConstraintMatrix

   * based on the same triangulation. This function is used, for example, for
   * extrapolating patchwise a piecewise linear solution to a piecewise
   * quadratic solution.
   *
   * The function's name is historical and probably not particularly well
   * chosen. The function performs the following operations, one after the
   * other:
   *
   * - It interpolates directly from every cell of @p dof1 to the
   * corresponding cell of `dof2` using the interpolation matrix of the finite
   * element spaces used on these cells and provided by the finite element
   * objects involved. This step is done using the FETools::interpolate()
   * function. - It then performs a loop over all non-active cells of `dof2`.
   * If such a non-active cell has at least one active child, then we call the
   * children of this cell a "patch". We then interpolate from the children of
   * this patch to the patch, using the finite element space associated with
   * `dof2` and immediately interpolate back to the children. In essence, this
   * information throws away all information in the solution vector that lives
   * on a scale smaller than the patch cell. - Since we traverse non-active
   * cells from the coarsest to the finest levels, we may find patches that
   * correspond to child cells of previously treated patches if the mesh had
   * been refined adaptively (this cannot happen if the mesh has been refined
   * globally because there the children of a patch are all active). We also
   * perform the operation described above on these patches, but it is easy to
   * see that on patches that are children of previously treated patches, the
   * operation is now the identity operation (since it interpolates from the
   * children of the current patch a function that had previously been
   * interpolated to these children from an even coarser patch). Consequently,
   * this does not alter the solution vector any more.
   *
   * The name of the function originates from the fact that it can be used to
   * construct a representation of a function of higher polynomial degree on a
   * once coarser mesh. For example, if you imagine that you start with a
   * $Q_1$ function on globally refined mesh, and that @p dof2 is associated
   * with a $Q_2$ element, then this function computes the equivalent of the
   * operator $I_{2h}^{(2)}$ interpolating the original piecewise linear
   * function onto a quadratic function on a once coarser mesh with mesh size
   * $2h$ (but representing this function on the original mesh with size $h$).
   * If the exact solution is sufficiently smooth, then
   * $u^\ast=I_{2h}^{(2)}u_h$ is typically a better approximation to the exact
   * solution $u$ of the PDE than $u_h$ is. In other words, this function
   * provides a postprocessing step that improves the solution in a similar
   * way one often obtains by extrapolating a sequence of solutions,
   * explaining the origin of the function's name.
   *
   * @note The resulting field does not satisfy continuity requirements of the
   * given finite elements if the algorithm outlined above is used. When you
   * use continuous elements on grids with hanging nodes, please use the @p
   * extrapolate function with an additional ConstraintMatrix argument, see
   * below.
   *
   * @note Since this function operates on patches of cells, it requires that
   * the underlying grid is refined at least once for every coarse grid cell.
   * If this is not the case, an exception will be raised.
