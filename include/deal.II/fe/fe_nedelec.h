/**
 * @warning Several aspects of the implementation are experimental. For the
 * moment, it is safe to use the element on globally refined meshes with
 * consistent orientation of faces. See the todo entries below for more
 * detailed caveats.
 *
 * Implementation of N&eacute;d&eacute;lec elements, conforming with the space
 * H<sup>curl</sup>. These elements generate vector fields with tangential
 * components continuous between mesh cells.
 *
 * We follow the convention that the degree of N&eacute;d&eacute;lec elements
 * denotes the polynomial degree of the largest complete polynomial subspace
 * contained in the N&eacute;d&eacute;lec space. This leads to the
 * consistently numbered sequence of spaces
 * @f[
 *   Q_{k+1}
 *   \stackrel{\text{grad}}{\rightarrow}
 *   \text{Nedelec}_k
 *   \stackrel{\text{curl}}{\rightarrow}
 *   \text{RaviartThomas}_k
 *   \stackrel{\text{div}}{\rightarrow}
 *   DGQ_{k}
 * @f]
 * Consequently, approximation order of the Nédélec space equals the value
 * <i>degree</i> given to the constructor. In this scheme, the lowest order
 * element would be created by the call FE_Nedelec<dim>(0). Note that this
 * follows the convention of Brezzi and Raviart, though not the one used in
 * the original paper by Nédélec.
 *
 * This class is not implemented for the codimension one case (<tt>spacedim !=
 * dim</tt>).
 *
 * @todo Even if this element is implemented for two and three space
 * dimensions, the definition of the node values relies on consistently
 * oriented faces in 3D. Therefore, care should be taken on complicated
 * meshes.
 *
 * <h3>Restriction on transformations</h3>
 *
 * In some sense, the implementation of this element is not complete, but you
 * will rarely notice. Here is the fact: since the element is vector-valued
 * already on the unit cell, the Jacobian matrix (or its inverse) is needed
 * already to generate the values of the shape functions on the cells in real
 * space. This is in contrast to most other elements, where you only need the
 * Jacobian for the gradients. Thus, to generate the gradients of Nédélec
 * shape functions, one would need to have the derivatives of the inverse of
 * the Jacobian matrix.
 *
 * Basically, the Nédélec shape functions can be understood as the gradients
 * of scalar shape functions on the real cell. They are thus the inverse
 * Jacobian matrix times the gradients of scalar shape functions on the unit
 * cell. The gradient of Nédélec shape functions is then, by the product
 * rule, the sum of first the derivative (with respect to true coordinates) of
 * the inverse Jacobian times the gradient (in unit coordinates) of the scalar
 * shape function, plus second the inverse Jacobian times the derivative (in
 * true coordinates) of the gradient (in unit coordinates) of the scalar shape
 * functions. Note that each of the derivatives in true coordinates can be
 * expressed as inverse Jacobian times gradient in unit coordinates.
 *
 * The problem is the derivative of the inverse Jacobian. This rank-3 tensor
 * can actually be computed (and we did so in very early versions of the
 * library), but is a large task and very time consuming, so we dropped it.
 * Since it is not available, we simply drop this first term.
 *
 * What this means for the present case: first the computation of gradients of
 * Nédélec shape functions is wrong in general. Second, in the following two
 * cases you will not notice this:
 *
 * - If the cell is a parallelogram, then the usual bi-/trilinear mapping is
 * in fact affine. In that case, the gradient of the Jacobian vanishes and the
 * gradient of the shape functions is computed exactly, since the first term
 * is zero.
 *
 * - With the Nédélec elements, you will usually want to compute the curl,
 * not the general derivative tensor. However, the curl of the Jacobian
 * vanishes, so for the curl of shape functions the first term is irrelevant,
 * and the curl will always be computed correctly even on cells that are not
 * parallelograms.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Interpolation</h3>
 *
 * The
 * @ref GlossInterpolation "interpolation"
 * operators associated with the N&eacute;d&eacute;lec element are constructed
 * such that interpolation and computing the curl are commuting operations on
 * rectangular mesh cells. We require this from interpolating arbitrary
 * functions as well as the #restriction matrices.
 *
 * <h4>Node values</h4>
 *
 * The
 * @ref GlossNodes "node values"
 * for an element of degree <i>k</i> on the reference cell are:
 * <ol>
 * <li> On edges: the moments of the tangential component with respect to
 * polynomials of degree <i>k</i>.
 * <li> On faces: the moments of the tangential components with respect to
 * <tt>dim</tt>-1 dimensional FE_Nedelec polynomials of degree <i>k</i>-1.
 * <li> In cells: the moments with respect to gradients of polynomials in FE_Q
 * of degree <i>k</i>.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h4>Generalized support points</h4>
 *
 * The node values above rely on integrals, which will be computed by
 * quadrature rules themselves. The generalized support points are a set of
 * points such that this quadrature can be performed with sufficient accuracy.
 * The points needed are those of QGauss<sub>k+1</sub> on each edge and
 * QGauss<sub>k+2</sub> on each face and in the interior of the cell (or none
 * for N<sub>1</sub>).
