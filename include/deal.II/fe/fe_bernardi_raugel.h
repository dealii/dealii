/**
 * The Bernardi-Raugel element.
 *
 * This class implements the non-standard Bernardi-Raugel (BR) element
 * that can be used as one part of a stable velocity/pressure pair for
 * the Stokes equation. The BR element can be seen as either an
 * enriched version of the $Q_1^d$ element with added bubble functions
 * on each edge (in 2d) or face (in 3d), or as a reduced version of
 * the $Q_2^d$ element. It addresses the fact that the $Q_1^d\times
 * Q_0$ combination is not inf-sup stable (requiring a larger velocity
 * space), and that the $Q_2^d\times Q_1$ combination is stable but
 * sub-optimal since the velocity space is too large relative to the
 * pressure space to provide additional accuracy commensurate with the
 * cost of the large number of velocity unknowns.
 *
 * The element was introduced in the following paper:
 * @code{.bib}
 * @article{BR85,
 *   author    = {Christine Bernardi and Genevi{\`e}ve Raugel},
 *   title     = {Analysis of some finite elements for the {S}tokes problem},
 *   journal   = {Mathematics of Computation},
 *   publisher = {American Mathematical Society ({AMS})},
 *   volume    = {44},
 *   number    = {169},
 *   pages     = {71--79},
 *   year      = {1985},
 *   doi       = {10.1090/s0025-5718-1985-0771031-7},
 *   url       = {https://doi.org/10.1090/s0025-5718-1985-0771031-7}
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h3>Degrees of freedom</h3>
 *
 * The BR1 element has <i>dim</i> degrees of freedom on each vertex and 1 on
 * each face. The shape functions are ordered by the $(Q_1)^d$ shape functions
 * supported on each vertex, increasing according to vertex ordering on the
 * element in GeometryInfo, then the bubble functions follow in the ordering
 * given in PolynomialsBernardiRaugel.
 *
 * This element only has 1 degree (degree $p=1$) because it yields an LBB stable
 * pair BR1-P0 for Stokes problems which is lower degree than the Taylor-Hood
 * element. The pair is sometimes referred to as an enriched P1-P0 element or a
 * reduced P2-P0 element.
 *
 * This element does not support hanging nodes or multigrid in the current
 * implementation.
 *
 * Some numerical experiments have shown that this element may converge with
 * first-order accuracy when using the BR1-Q0 pair for the mixed Laplace
 * equation in step-20.
