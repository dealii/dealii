/**
 * Mapping class that uses C1 (continuously differentiable) cubic mappings of
 * the boundary. This class is built atop of MappingQ by simply determining
 * the interpolation points for a cubic mapping of the boundary differently:
 * MappingQ chooses them such that they interpolate the boundary, while this
 * class chooses them such that the discretized boundary is globally
 * continuously differentiable.
 *
 * To use this class, make sure that the Boundary::@p get_normals_at_vertices
 * function is implemented for the user's boundary object.
 *
 * For more information about the <tt>spacedim</tt> template parameter check
 * the documentation of FiniteElement or the one of Triangulation.
