/**
 * Implementation of Raviart-Thomas (RT) elements. The Raviart-Thomas space
 * is designed to solve problems in which the solution only lives in the
 * space
 * $H^\text{div}=\{ {\mathbf u} \in L_2: \text{div}\, {\mathbf u} \in L_2\}$,
 * rather than in the more commonly used space
 * $H^1=\{ u \in L_2: \nabla u \in L_2\}$. In other words, the solution must
 * be a vector field whose divergence is square integrable, but for which the
 * gradient may not be square integrable. The typical application for this
 * space (and these elements) is to the mixed formulation of the Laplace
 * equation and related situations, see for example step-20. The defining
 * characteristic of functions in $H^\text{div}$ is that they are in
 * general discontinuous -- but that if you draw a line in 2d (or a
 * surface in 3d), then the <i>normal</i> component of the vector
 * field must be continuous across the line (or surface) even though
 * the tangential component may not be. As a consequence, the
 * Raviart-Thomas element is constructed in such a way that (i) it is
 * @ref vector_valued "vector-valued", (ii) the shape functions are
 * discontinuous, but (iii) the normal component of the vector field
 * represented by each shape function is continuous across the faces
 * of cells.
 *
 * Other properties of the Raviart-Thomas element are that (i) it is
 * @ref GlossPrimitive "not a primitive element"; (ii) the shape functions
 * are defined so that certain integrals over the faces are either zero
 * or one, rather than the common case of certain point values being
 * either zero or one. (There is, however, the FE_RaviartThomasNodal
 * element that uses point values.)
 *
 * We follow the commonly used -- though confusing -- definition of the "degree"
 * of RT elements. Specifically, the "degree" of the element denotes
 * the polynomial degree of the <i>largest complete polynomial subspace</i>
 * contained in the finite element space, even if the space may contain shape
 * functions of higher polynomial degree. The lowest order element is
 * consequently FE_RaviartThomas(0), i.e., the Raviart-Thomas element "of
 * degree zero", even though the functions of this space are in general
 * polynomials of degree one in each variable. This choice of "degree"
 * implies that the approximation order of the function itself is
 * <i>degree+1</i>, as with usual polynomial spaces. The numbering so chosen
 * implies the sequence
 * @f[
 *   Q_{k+1}
 *   \stackrel{\text{grad}}{\rightarrow}
 *   \text{Nedelec}_k
 *   \stackrel{\text{curl}}{\rightarrow}
 *   \text{RaviartThomas}_k
 *   \stackrel{\text{div}}{\rightarrow}
 *   DGQ_{k}
 * @f]
 *
 * This class is not implemented for the codimension one case (<tt>spacedim !=
 * dim</tt>).
 *
 *
 * <h3>Interpolation</h3>
 *
 * The
 * @ref GlossInterpolation "interpolation"
 * operators associated with the RT element are constructed such that
 * interpolation and computing the divergence are commuting operations. We
 * require this from interpolating arbitrary functions as well as the
 * #restriction matrices.  It can be achieved by two interpolation schemes,
 * the simplified one in FE_RaviartThomasNodal and the original one here:
 *
 * <h4>Node values on edges/faces</h4>
 *
 * On edges or faces, the
 * @ref GlossNodes "node values"
 * are the moments of the normal component of the interpolated function with
 * respect to the traces of the RT polynomials. Since the normal trace of the
 * RT space of degree <i>k</i> on an edge/face is the space
 * <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i>, the moments are taken with respect to this space.
 *
 * <h4>Interior node values</h4>
 *
 * Higher order RT spaces have interior nodes. These are moments taken with
 * respect to the gradient of functions in <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i> on the cell
 * (this space is the matching space for RT<sub>k</sub> in a mixed
 * formulation).
 *
 * <h4>Generalized support points</h4>
 *
 * The node values above rely on integrals, which will be computed by
 * quadrature rules themselves. The generalized support points are a set of
 * points such that this quadrature can be performed with sufficient accuracy.
 * The points needed are those of QGauss<sub>k+1</sub> on each face as well as
 * QGauss<sub>k+1</sub> in the interior of the cell (or none for
 * RT<sub>0</sub>).

   *
   * <h3>Example: Raviart-Thomas Elements of order 2 (tensor polynomial
   * degree 3)</h3>
   *
   * The dofs on a face are connected to a $n\times n$
   * matrix where here <code>n=3</code>. In our example we can imagine the
   * following dofs on a quad (face):
   *
   * @verbatim
   *  ___________
   * |           |
   * |  6  7  8  |
   * |           |
   * |  3  4  5  |
   * |           |
   * |  0  1  2  |
   * |___________|
   *@endverbatim
   *
   * We have for a local <code>face_dof_index=i+n*j</code> with index
   * <code>i</code> in x-direction and index <code>j</code> in y-direction
   * running from 0 to <code>n-1</code>.  To extract <code>i</code> and
   * <code>j</code> we can use <code>i = face_dof_index % n</code> and <code>j =
   * dof_index / n</code> (integer division). The indices <code>i</code> and
   * <code>j</code> can then be used to compute the offset.
   *
   * For our example of Raviart-Thomas elements this means if if the
   * switches are <code>(true | true | true)</code> that means we rotate the
   * face first by + 90 degree(counterclockwise) then by another +180
   * degrees but we do not flip it since the face has standard
   * orientation. The flip axis is the diagonal from the lower left to the upper
   * right corner of the face. With these flags the configuration above becomes:
   *
   *@verbatim
   *  ___________
   * |           |
   * |  2  5  8  |
   * |           |
   * |  1  4  7  |
   * |           |
   * |  0  3  6  |
   * |___________|
   * @endverbatim
   *
   * Note that the necessity of a permutation depends on the combination of the
   * three flags.
   *
   * There is also a pattern for the sign change of the permuted shape functions
   * that depends on the combination of the switches. In the above example it
   * would be
   *
   * @verbatim
   *  ___________
   * |           |
   * |  +  -  +  |
   * |           |
   * |  +  -  +  |
   * |           |
   * |  +  -  +  |
   * |___________|
   * @endverbatim
   *
   * The relevant table for the sign changes is declared in FE_PolyTensor.

/**
 * The Raviart-Thomas elements with node functionals defined as point values
 * in Gauss points.
 *
 * <h3>Description of node values</h3>
 *
 * For this Raviart-Thomas element, the node values are not cell and face
 * moments with respect to certain polynomials, but the values in quadrature
 * points. Following the general scheme for numbering degrees of freedom, the
 * node values on edges are first, edge by edge, according to the natural
 * ordering of the edges of a cell. The interior degrees of freedom are last.
 *
 * For an RT-element of degree <i>k</i>, we choose <i>(k+1)<sup>d-1</sup></i>
 * Gauss points on each face. These points are ordered lexicographically with
 * respect to the orientation of the face. This way, the normal component
 * which is in <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i> is uniquely determined. Furthermore, since
 * this Gauss-formula is exact on <i>Q<sub>2k+1</sub></i>, these node values
 * correspond to the exact integration of the moments of the RT-space.
 *
 * In the interior of the cells, the moments are with respect to an
 * anisotropic <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i> space, where the test functions are one
 * degree lower in the direction corresponding to the vector component under
 * consideration. This is emulated by using an anisotropic Gauss formula for
 * integration.
 *
 * @todo The current implementation is for Cartesian meshes only. You must use
 * MappingCartesian.
 *
 * @todo Even if this element is implemented for two and three space
 * dimensions, the definition of the node values relies on consistently
 * oriented faces in 3D. Therefore, care should be taken on complicated
 * meshes.
 *
 * @note The degree stored in the member variable
 * FiniteElementData<dim>::degree is higher by one than the constructor
 * argument!
