/**
 * Implementation of Raviart-Thomas (RT) elements, conforming with the space
 * H<sup>div</sup>. These elements generate vector fields with normal
 * components continuous between mesh cells.
 *
 * We follow the usual definition of the degree of RT elements, which denotes
 * the polynomial degree of the largest complete polynomial subspace contained
 * in the RT space. Then, approximation order of the function itself is
 * <i>degree+1</i>, as with usual polynomial spaces. The numbering so chosen
 * implies the sequence
 * @f[
 *   Q_{k+1}
 *   \stackrel{\text{grad}}{\rightarrow}
 *   \text{Nedelec}_k
 *   \stackrel{\text{curl}}{\rightarrow}
 *   \text{RaviartThomas}_k
 *   \stackrel{\text{div}}{\rightarrow}
 *   DGQ_{k}
 * @f]
 * The lowest order element is consequently FE_RaviartThomas(0).
 *
 * This class is not implemented for the codimension one case (<tt>spacedim !=
 * dim</tt>).
 *
 * @todo Even if this element is implemented for two and three space
 * dimensions, the definition of the node values relies on consistently
 * oriented faces in 3D. Therefore, care should be taken on complicated
 * meshes.
 *
 * <h3>Interpolation</h3>
 *
 * The
 * @ref GlossInterpolation "interpolation"
 * operators associated with the RT element are constructed such that
 * interpolation and computing the divergence are commuting operations. We
 * require this from interpolating arbitrary functions as well as the
 * #restriction matrices.  It can be achieved by two interpolation schemes,
 * the simplified one in FE_RaviartThomasNodal and the original one here:
 *
 * <h4>Node values on edges/faces</h4>
 *
 * On edges or faces, the
 * @ref GlossNodes "node values"
 * are the moments of the normal component of the interpolated function with
 * respect to the traces of the RT polynomials. Since the normal trace of the
 * RT space of degree <i>k</i> on an edge/face is the space
 * <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i>, the moments are taken with respect to this space.
 *
 * <h4>Interior node values</h4>
 *
 * Higher order RT spaces have interior nodes. These are moments taken with
 * respect to the gradient of functions in <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i> on the cell
 * (this space is the matching space for RT<sub>k</sub> in a mixed
 * formulation).
 *
 * <h4>Generalized support points</h4>
 *
 * The node values above rely on integrals, which will be computed by
 * quadrature rules themselves. The generalized support points are a set of
 * points such that this quadrature can be performed with sufficient accuracy.
 * The points needed are thode of QGauss<sub>k+1</sub> on each face as well as
 * QGauss<sub>k</sub> in the interior of the cell (or none for
 * RT<sub>0</sub>).

/**
 * The Raviart-Thomas elements with node functionals defined as point values
 * in Gauss points.
 *
 * <h3>Description of node values</h3>
 *
 * For this Raviart-Thomas element, the node values are not cell and face
 * moments with respect to certain polynomials, but the values in quadrature
 * points. Following the general scheme for numbering degrees of freedom, the
 * node values on edges are first, edge by edge, according to the natural
 * ordering of the edges of a cell. The interior degrees of freedom are last.
 *
 * For an RT-element of degree <i>k</i>, we choose <i>(k+1)<sup>d-1</sup></i>
 * Gauss points on each face. These points are ordered lexicographically with
 * respect to the orientation of the face. This way, the normal component
 * which is in <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i> is uniquely determined. Furthermore, since
 * this Gauss-formula is exact on <i>Q<sub>2k+1</sub></i>, these node values
 * correspond to the exact integration of the moments of the RT-space.
 *
 * In the interior of the cells, the moments are with respect to an
 * anisotropic <i>Q<sub>k</sub></i> space, where the test functions are one
 * degree lower in the direction corresponding to the vector component under
 * consideration. This is emulated by using an anisotropic Gauss formula for
 * integration.
 *
 * @todo The current implementation is for Cartesian meshes only. You must use
 * MappingCartesian.
 *
 * @todo Even if this element is implemented for two and three space
 * dimensions, the definition of the node values relies on consistently
 * oriented faces in 3D. Therefore, care should be taken on complicated
 * meshes.
 *
 * @note The degree stored in the member variable
 * FiniteElementData<dim>::degree is higher by one than the constructor
 * argument!
