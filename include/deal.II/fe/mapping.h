/**
 * @short Abstract base class for mapping classes.
 *
 * This class declares the interface for the functionality to describe
 * mappings from the reference (unit) cell to a cell in real space, as well as
 * for filling the information necessary to use the FEValues, FEFaceValues,
 * and FESubfaceValues classes. Concrete implementations of these interfaces
 * are provided in derived classes.
 *
 * <h3>Mathematics of the mapping</h3>
 *
 * The mapping is a transformation $\mathbf x = \mathbf F_K(\hat{\mathbf  x})$
 * which maps points $\hat{\mathbf x}$ in the reference cell
 * $[0,1]^\text{dim}$ to points $\mathbf x$ in the actual grid cell
 * $K\subset{\mathbb R}^\text{spacedim}$. Many of the applications of such
 * mappings require the Jacobian of this mapping, $J(\hat{\mathbf x}) =
 * \hat\nabla {\mathbf F}_K(\hat{\mathbf  x})$. For instance, if
 * dim=spacedim=2, we have
 * @f[
 * J(\hat{\mathbf  x}) = \left(\begin{matrix}
 * \frac{\partial x}{\partial \hat x} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial \hat y}
 * \\
 * \frac{\partial y}{\partial \hat x} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \hat y}
 * \end{matrix}\right)
 * @f]
 *
 * <h4>%Mapping of scalar functions</h4>
 *
 * The shape functions of scalar finite elements are typically defined on a
 * reference cell and are then simply mapped according to the rule
 * @f[
 * \varphi(\mathbf x) = \varphi\bigl(\mathbf F_K(\hat{\mathbf  x})\bigr)
 * = \hat \varphi(\hat{\mathbf  x}).
 * @f]
 *
 *
 * <h4>%Mapping of integrals</h4>
 *
 * Using simply a change of variables, integrals of scalar functions over a
 * cell $K$ can be expressed as an integral over the reference cell $\hat K$.
 * Specifically, The volume form $d\hat x$ is transformed so that
 * @f[
 *  \int_K u(\mathbf x)\,dx = \int_{\hat K} \hat
 * u(\hat{\mathbf  x}) \left|\text{det}J(\hat{\mathbf  x})\right|
 * \,d\hat x.
 * @f]
 *
 * In expressions where such integrals are approximated by quadrature, this
 * then leads to terms of the form
 * @f[
 *  \int_K u(\mathbf x)\,dx
 *  \approx
 *  \sum_{q}
 *  \hat u(\hat{\mathbf  x}_q)
 *  \underbrace{\left|\text{det}J(\hat{\mathbf  x}_q)\right| w_q}_{=:
 * \text{JxW}_q}.
 * @f]
 * Here, the weights $\text{JxW}_q$ of each quadrature point (where <i>JxW</i>
 * mnemonically stands for <i>Jacobian times Quadrature Weights</i>) take the
 * role of the $dx$ in the original integral. Consequently, they appear in all
 * code that computes integrals approximated by quadrature, and are accessed
 * by FEValues::JxW().
 *
 * @todo Document what happens in the codimension-1 case.
 *
 *
 * <h4>%Mapping of vector fields, differential forms and gradients of vector
 * fields</h4>
 *
 * The transformation of vector fields or differential forms (gradients of
 * scalar functions) $\mathbf v$, and gradients of vector fields $\mathbf T$
 * follows the general form
 *
 * @f[
 * \mathbf v(\mathbf x) = \mathbf A(\hat{\mathbf  x})
 * \hat{\mathbf  v}(\hat{\mathbf  x}),
 * \qquad
 * \mathbf T(\mathbf x) = \mathbf A(\hat{\mathbf  x})
 * \hat{\mathbf  T}(\hat{\mathbf  x}) \mathbf B(\hat{\mathbf  x}).
 * @f]
 * The differential forms <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are determined by the kind of
 * object being transformed. These transformations are performed through the
 * transform() functions, and the type of object being transformed is
 * specified by their MappingKind argument. See the documentation there for
 * possible choices.
 *
 * <h4>Derivatives of the mapping</h4>
 *
 * Some applications require the derivatives of the mapping, of which the
 * first order derivative is the mapping Jacobian, $J_{iJ}(\hat{\mathbf
 * x})=\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial \hat x_J}$, described above. Higher order
 * derivatives of the mapping are similarly defined, for example the Jacobian
 * derivative, $\hat H_{iJK}(\hat{\mathbf  x}) = \frac{\partial^2
 * x_i}{\partial \hat x_J \partial \hat x_K}$, and the Jacobian second
 * derivative, $\hat K_{iJKL}(\hat{\mathbf  x}) = \frac{\partial^3
 * x_i}{\partial \hat x_J \partial \hat x_K \partial \hat x_L}$. It is also
 * useful to define the "pushed-forward" versions of the higher order
 * derivatives: the Jacobian pushed-forward derivative, $H_{ijk}(\hat{\mathbf
 * x}) = \frac{\partial^2 x_i}{\partial \hat x_J \partial \hat
 * x_K}(J_{jJ})^{-1}(J_{kK})^{-1}$, and the Jacobian pushed-forward second
 * derivative, $K_{ijkl}(\hat{\mathbf  x}) = \frac{\partial^3 x_i}{\partial
 * \hat x_J \partial \hat x_K \partial \hat
 * x_L}(J_{jJ})^{-1}(J_{kK})^{-1}(J_{lL})^{-1}$. These pushed-forward versions
 * can be used to compute the higher order derivatives of functions defined on
 * the reference cell with respect to the real cell coordinates. For instance,
 * the Jacobian derivative with respect to the real cell coordinates is given
 * by:
 *
 * @f[
 * \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left[J_{iJ}(\hat{\mathbf  x})\right] =
 * H_{ikn}(\hat{\mathbf  x})J_{nJ}(\hat{\mathbf  x}),
 * @f]
 * and the derivative of the Jacobian inverse with respect to the real cell
 * coordinates is similarly given by:
 * @f[
 * \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left[\left(J_{iJ}(\hat{\mathbf
 * x})\right)^{-1}\right] = -H_{nik}(\hat{\mathbf  x})\left(J_{nJ}(\hat{\mathbf
 * x})\right)^{-1}.
 * @f]
 *
 * In a similar fashion, higher order derivatives, with respect to the real
 * cell coordinates, of functions defined on the reference cell can be defined
 * using the Jacobian pushed-forward higher-order derivatives. For example,
 * the derivative, with respect to the real cell coordinates, of the Jacobian
 * pushed-forward derivative is given by:
 *
 * @f[
 * \frac{\partial}{\partial x_l}\left[H_{ijk}(\hat{\mathbf  x})\right] =
 * K_{ijkl}(\hat{\mathbf  x}) -H_{mjl}(\hat{\mathbf  x})H_{imk}(\hat{\mathbf
 * x})-H_{mkl}(\hat{\mathbf  x})H_{imj}(\hat{\mathbf  x}).
 * @f]

   * Base class for internal data of mapping objects. The internal mechanism
   * is that upon construction of a FEValues object, it asks the mapping and
   * finite element classes that are to be used to allocate memory for their
   * own purpose in which they may store data that only needs to be computed
   * once. For example, most finite elements will store the values of the
   * shape functions at the quadrature points in this object, since they do
   * not change from cell to cell and only need to be computed once. The same
   * may be true for Mapping classes that want to only evaluate the shape
   * functions used for mapping once at the quadrature points.
   *
   * Since different FEValues objects using different quadrature rules might
   * access the same mapping object at the same time, it is necessary to
   * create one such object per FEValues object. FEValues does this by calling
   * Mapping::get_data(), or in reality the implementation of the
   * corresponding function in derived classes. Ownership of the object
   * created by Mapping::get_data() is then transferred to the FEValues
   * object, but a reference to this object is passed to the mapping object
   * every time it is asked to compute information on a concrete cell. This
   * happens when FEValues::reinit() (or the corresponding classes in
   * FEFaceValues and FESubfaceValues) call Mapping::fill_fe_values() (and
   * similarly via Mapping::fill_fe_face_values() and
   * Mapping::fill_fe_subface_values()).
   *
   * The purpose of this class is for mapping objects to store information
   * that can be computed once at the beginning, on the reference cell, and to
   * access it later when computing information on a concrete cell. As such,
   * the object handed to Mapping::fill_fe_values() is marked as
   * <code>const</code>, because the assumption is that at the time this
   * information is used, it will not need to modified again. However, classes
   * derived from Mapping can also use such objects for two other purposes:
   *
   * - To provide scratch space for computations that are done in
   * Mapping::fill_fe_values() and similar functions. Some of the derived
   * classes would like to use scratch arrays and it would be a waste of time
   * to allocate these arrays every time this function is called, just to de-
   * allocate it again at the end of the function. Rather, one could allocate
   * this memory once as a member variable of the current class, and simply
   * use it in Mapping::fill_fe_values().
   * - After calling Mapping::fill_fe_values(), FEValues::reinit()
   * calls FiniteElement::fill_fe_values() where the finite element computes
   * values, gradients, etc of the shape functions using both information
   * computed once at the beginning using a mechanism similar to the one
   * described here (see FiniteElement::InternalDataBase) as well as the data
   * already computed by Mapping::fill_fe_values(). As part of its work, some
   * implementations of FiniteElement::fill_fe_values() need to transform
   * shape function data, and they do so by calling Mapping::transform(). The
   * call to the latter function also receives a reference to the
   * Mapping::InternalDataBase object. Since Mapping::transform() may be
   * called many times on each cell, it is sometimes worth for derived classes
   * to compute some information only once in Mapping::fill_fe_values() and
   * reuse it in Mapping::transform(). This information can also be stored in
   * the classes that derived mapping classes derive from InternalDataBase.
   *
   * In both of these cases, the InternalDataBase object being passed around
   * is "morally const", i.e., no external observer can tell whether a scratch
   * array or some intermediate data for Mapping::transform() is being
   * modified by Mapping::fill_fe_values() or not. Consequently, the
   * InternalDataBase objects are always passed around as <code>const</code>
   * objects. Derived classes that would like to make use of the two
   * additional uses outlined above therefore need to mark the member
   * variables they want to use for these purposes as <code>mutable</code> to
   * allow for their modification despite the fact that the surrounding object
   * is marked as <code>const</code>.

   * Compute information about the mapping from the reference cell to the real
   * cell indicated by the first argument to this function. Derived classes
   * will have to implement this function based on the kind of mapping they
   * represent. It is called by FEValues::reinit().
   *
   * Conceptually, this function's represents the application of the mapping
   * $\mathbf x=\mathbf F_K(\hat {\mathbf x})$ from reference coordinates
   * $\mathbf\in [0,1]^d$ to real space coordinates $\mathbf x$ for a given
   * cell $K$. Its purpose is to compute the following kinds of data:
   *
   * - Data that results from the application of the mapping itself, e.g.,
   * computing the location $\mathbf x_q = \mathbf F_K(\hat{\mathbf x}_q)$ of
   * quadrature points on the real cell, and that is directly useful to users
   * of FEValues, for example during assembly.
   * - Data that is necessary for finite element implementations to compute
   * their shape functions on the real cell. To this end, the
   * FEValues::reinit() function calls FiniteElement::fill_fe_values() after
   * the current function, and the output of this function serves as input to
   * FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(). Examples of information that needs to be
   * computed here for use by the finite element classes is the Jacobian of
   * the mapping, $\hat\nabla \mathbf F_K(\hat{\mathbf x})$ or its inverse,
   * for example to transform the gradients of shape functions on the
   * reference cell to the gradients of shape functions on the real cell.
   *
   * The information computed by this function is used to fill the various
   * member variables of the output argument of this function. Which of the
   * member variables of that structure should be filled is determined by the
   * update flags stored in the Mapping::InternalDataBase object passed to
   * this function.
   *
   * An extensive discussion of the interaction between this function and
   * FEValues can be found in the
   * @ref FE_vs_Mapping_vs_FEValues
   * documentation module.
   *
   * @param[in] cell The cell of the triangulation for which this function is
   * to compute a mapping from the reference cell to.
   * @param[in] cell_similarity Whether or not the cell given as first
   * argument is simply a translation, rotation, etc of the cell for which
   * this function was called the most recent time. This information is
   * computed simply by matching the vertices (as stored by the Triangulation)
   * between the previous and the current cell. The value passed here may be
   * modified by implementations of this function and should then be returned
   * (see the discussion of the return value of this function).
   * @param[in] quadrature A reference to the quadrature formula in use for
   * the current evaluation. This quadrature object is the same as the one
   * used when creating the @p internal_data object. The object is used both
   * to map the location of quadrature points, as well as to compute the JxW
   * values for each quadrature point (which involves the quadrature weights).
   * @param[in] internal_data A reference to an object previously created by
   * get_data() and that may be used to store information the mapping can
   * compute once on the reference cell. See the documentation of the
   * Mapping::InternalDataBase class for an extensive description of the
   * purpose of these objects.
   * @param[out] output_data A reference to an object whose member variables
   * should be computed. Not all of the members of this argument need to be
   * filled; which ones need to be filled is determined by the update flags
   * stored inside the @p internal_data object.
   * @return An updated value of the @p cell_similarity argument to this
   * function. The returned value will be used for the corresponding argument
   * when FEValues::reinit() calls FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(). In most
   * cases, derived classes will simply want to return the value passed for @p
   * cell_similarity. However, implementations of this function may downgrade
   * the level of cell similarity. This is, for example, the case for classes
   * that take not only into account the locations of the vertices of a cell
   * (as reported by the Triangulation), but also other information specific
   * to the mapping. The purpose is that FEValues::reinit() can compute
   * whether a cell is similar to the previous one only based on the cell's
   * vertices, whereas the mapping may also consider displacement fields
   * (e.g., in the MappingQ1Eulerian and MappingFEField classes). In such
   * cases, the mapping may conclude that the previously computed cell
   * similarity is too optimistic, and invalidate it for subsequent use in
   * FiniteElement::fill_fe_values() by returning a less optimistic cell
   * similarity value.
   *
   * @note FEValues ensures that this function is always called with the same
   * pair of @p internal_data and @p output_data objects. In other words, if
   * an implementation of this function knows that it has written a piece of
   * data into the output argument in a previous call, then there is no need
   * to copy it there again in a later call if the implementation knows that
   * this is the same value.
