/**
 * Base class for finite elements in arbitrary dimensions. This class provides
 * several fields which describe a specific finite element and which are
 * filled by derived classes. It more or less only offers the fields and
 * access functions which makes it possible to copy finite elements without
 * knowledge of the actual type (linear, quadratic, etc). In particular, the
 * functions to fill the data fields of FEValues and its derived classes are
 * declared.
 *
 * The interface of this class is very restrictive. The reason is that finite
 * element values should be accessed only by use of FEValues objects. These,
 * together with FiniteElement are responsible to provide an optimized
 * implementation.
 *
 * This class declares the shape functions and their derivatives on the unit
 * cell $[0,1]^d$. The means to transform them onto a given cell in physical
 * space is provided by the FEValues class with a Mapping object.
 *
 * The different matrices are initialized with the correct size, such that in
 * the derived (concrete) finite element classes, their entries only have to
 * be filled in; no resizing is needed. If the matrices are not defined by a
 * concrete finite element, they should be resized to zero. This way functions
 * using them can find out, that they are missing. On the other hand, it is
 * possible to use finite element classes without implementation of the full
 * functionality, if only part of it is needed. The functionality under
 * consideration here is hanging nodes constraints and grid transfer,
 * respectively.
 *
 * The <tt>spacedim</tt> parameter has to be used if one wants to solve
 * problems in the boundary element method formulation or in an equivalent
 * one, as it is explained in the Triangulation class. If not specified, this
 * parameter takes the default value <tt>=dim</tt> so that this class can be
 * used to solve problems in the finite element method formulation.
 *
 * <h3>Components and blocks</h3>
 *
 * For vector valued elements shape functions may have nonzero entries in one
 * or several
 * @ref GlossComponent "components"
 * of the vector valued function. If the element is
 * @ref GlossPrimitive "primitive",
 * there is indeed a single component with a nonzero entry for each shape
 * function. This component can be determined by system_to_component_index(),
 * the number of components is FiniteElementData::n_components().
 *
 * Furthermore, you may want to split your linear system into
 * @ref GlossBlock "blocks"
 * for the use in BlockVector, BlockSparseMatrix, BlockMatrixArray and so on.
 * If you use non-primitive elements, you cannot determine the block number by
 * system_to_component_index(). Instead, you can use system_to_block_index(),
 * which will automatically take care of the additional components occupied by
 * vector valued elements. The number of generated blocks can be determined by
 * FiniteElementData::n_blocks().
 *
 * If you decide to operate by base element and multiplicity, the function
 * first_block_of_base() will be helpful.
 *
 * <h3>Support points</h3>
 *
 * Since a FiniteElement does not have information on the actual grid cell, it
 * can only provide
 * @ref GlossSupport "support points"
 * on the unit cell. Support points on the actual grid cell must be computed
 * by mapping these points. The class used for this kind of operation is
 * FEValues. In most cases, code of the following type will serve to provide
 * the mapped support points.
 *
 * @code
 * Quadrature<dim> dummy_quadrature (fe.get_unit_support_points());
 * FEValues<dim>   fe_values (mapping, fe, dummy_quadrature,
 *                            update_quadrature_points);
 * fe_values.reinit (cell);
 * Point<dim> mapped_point = fe_values.quadrature_point (i);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, the points can be transformed one-by-one:
 * @code
 * const vector<Point<dim> > &unit_points =
 *    fe.get_unit_support_points();
 *
 * Point<dim> mapped_point =
 *    mapping.transform_unit_to_real_cell (cell, unit_points[i]);
 * @endcode
 * This is a shortcut, and as all shortcuts should be used cautiously. If the
 * mapping of all support points is needed, the first variant should be
 * preferred for efficiency.
 *
 * @note Finite elements' implementation of the get_unit_support_points()
 * returns these points in the same order as shape functions. As a
 * consequence, the quadrature points accessed above are also ordered in this
 * way. The order of shape functions is typically documented in the class
 * documentation of the various finite element classes.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Notes on the implementation of derived classes</h3>
 *
 * The following sections list the information to be provided by derived
 * classes, depending on the dimension. They are followed by a list of
 * functions helping to generate these values.
 *
 * <h4>Finite elements in one dimension</h4>
 *
 * Finite elements in one dimension need only set the #restriction and
 * #prolongation matrices. The constructor of this class in one dimension
 * presets the #interface_constraints matrix to have dimension zero. Changing
 * this behaviour in derived classes is generally not a reasonable idea and
 * you risk getting into trouble.
 *
 * <h4>Finite elements in two dimensions</h4>
 *
 * In addition to the fields already present in 1D, a constraint matrix is
 * needed, if the finite element has node values located on edges or vertices.
 * These constraints are represented by an $m\times n$-matrix
 * #interface_constraints, where <i>m</i> is the number of degrees of freedom
 * on the refined side without the corner vertices (those dofs on the middle
 * vertex plus those on the two lines), and <i>n</i> is that of the unrefined
 * side (those dofs on the two vertices plus those on the line). The matrix is
 * thus a rectangular one. The $m\times n$ size of the #interface_constraints
 * matrix can also be accessed through the interface_constraints_size()
 * function.
 *
 * The mapping of the dofs onto the indices of the matrix on the unrefined
 * side is as follows: let $d_v$ be the number of dofs on a vertex, $d_l$ that
 * on a line, then $n=0...d_v-1$ refers to the dofs on vertex zero of the
 * unrefined line, $n=d_v...2d_v-1$ to those on vertex one,
 * $n=2d_v...2d_v+d_l-1$ to those on the line.
 *
 * Similarly, $m=0...d_v-1$ refers to the dofs on the middle vertex of the
 * refined side (vertex one of child line zero, vertex zero of child line
 * one), $m=d_v...d_v+d_l-1$ refers to the dofs on child line zero,
 * $m=d_v+d_l...d_v+2d_l-1$ refers to the dofs on child line one.  Please note
 * that we do not need to reserve space for the dofs on the end vertices of
 * the refined lines, since these must be mapped one-to-one to the appropriate
 * dofs of the vertices of the unrefined line.
 *
 * It should be noted that it is not possible to distribute a constrained
 * degree of freedom to other degrees of freedom which are themselves
 * constrained. Only one level of indirection is allowed. It is not known at
 * the time of this writing whether this is a constraint itself.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Finite elements in three dimensions</h4>
 *
 * For the interface constraints, almost the same holds as for the 2D case.
 * The numbering for the indices $n$ on the mother face is obvious and keeps
 * to the usual numbering of degrees of freedom on quadrilaterals.
 *
 * The numbering of the degrees of freedom on the interior of the refined
 * faces for the index $m$ is as follows: let $d_v$ and $d_l$ be as above, and
 * $d_q$ be the number of degrees of freedom per quadrilateral (and therefore
 * per face), then $m=0...d_v-1$ denote the dofs on the vertex at the center,
 * $m=d_v...5d_v-1$ for the dofs on the vertices at the center of the bounding
 * lines of the quadrilateral, $m=5d_v..5d_v+4*d_l-1$ are for the degrees of
 * freedom on the four lines connecting the center vertex to the outer
 * boundary of the mother face, $m=5d_v+4*d_l...5d_v+4*d_l+8*d_l-1$ for the
 * degrees of freedom on the small lines surrounding the quad, and
 * $m=5d_v+12*d_l...5d_v+12*d_l+4*d_q-1$ for the dofs on the four child faces.
 * Note the direction of the lines at the boundary of the quads, as shown
 * below.
 *
 * The order of the twelve lines and the four child faces can be extracted
 * from the following sketch, where the overall order of the different dof
 * groups is depicted:
 * @verbatim
 *    *--15--4--16--*
 *    |      |      |
 *    10 19  6  20  12
 *    |      |      |
 *    1--7---0--8---2
 *    |      |      |
 *    9  17  5  18  11
 *    |      |      |
 *    *--13--3--14--*
 * @endverbatim
 * The numbering of vertices and lines, as well as the numbering of children
 * within a line is consistent with the one described in Triangulation.
 * Therefore, this numbering is seen from the outside and inside,
 * respectively, depending on the face.
 *
 * The three-dimensional case has a few pitfalls available for derived classes
 * that want to implement constraint matrices. Consider the following case:
 * @verbatim
 *          *-------*
 *         /       /|
 *        /       / |
 *       /       /  |
 *      *-------*   |
 *      |       |   *-------*
 *      |       |  /       /|
 *      |   1   | /       / |
 *      |       |/       /  |
 *      *-------*-------*   |
 *      |       |       |   *
 *      |       |       |  /
 *      |   2   |   3   | /
 *      |       |       |/
 *      *-------*-------*
 * @endverbatim
 * Now assume that we want to refine cell 2. We will end up with two faces
 * with hanging nodes, namely the faces between cells 1 and 2, as well as
 * between cells 2 and 3. Constraints have to be applied to the degrees of
 * freedom on both these faces. The problem is that there is now an edge (the
 * top right one of cell 2) which is part of both faces. The hanging node(s)
 * on this edge are therefore constrained twice, once from both faces. To be
 * meaningful, these constraints of course have to be consistent: both faces
 * have to constrain the hanging nodes on the edge to the same nodes on the
 * coarse edge (and only on the edge, as there can then be no constraints to
 * nodes on the rest of the face), and they have to do so with the same
 * weights. This is sometimes tricky since the nodes on the edge may have
 * different local numbers.
 *
 * For the constraint matrix this means the following: if a degree of freedom
 * on one edge of a face is constrained by some other nodes on the same edge
 * with some weights, then the weights have to be exactly the same as those
 * for constrained nodes on the three other edges with respect to the
 * corresponding nodes on these edges. If this isn't the case, you will get
 * into trouble with the ConstraintMatrix class that is the primary consumer
 * of the constraint information: while that class is able to handle
 * constraints that are entered more than once (as is necessary for the case
 * above), it insists that the weights are exactly the same.
 *
 * <h4>Helper functions</h4>
 *
 * Construction of a finite element and computation of the matrices described
 * above may be a tedious task, in particular if it has to be performed for
 * several dimensions. Therefore, some functions in FETools have been provided
 * to help with these tasks.
 *
 * <h5>Computing the correct basis from "raw" basis functions</h5>
 *
 * First, already the basis of the shape function space may be difficult to
 * implement for arbitrary order and dimension. On the other hand, if the
 * @ref GlossNodes "node values"
 * are given, then the duality relation between node functionals and basis
 * functions defines the basis. As a result, the shape function space may be
 * defined with arbitrary "raw" basis functions, such that the actual finite
 * element basis is computed from linear combinations of them. The
 * coefficients of these combinations are determined by the duality of node
 * values.
 *
 * Using this matrix allows the construction of the basis of shape functions
 * in two steps.
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>Define the space of shape functions using an arbitrary basis
 * <i>w<sub>j</sub></i> and compute the matrix <i>M</i> of node functionals
 * <i>N<sub>i</sub></i> applied to these basis functions, such that its
 * entries are <i>m<sub>ij</sub> = N<sub>i</sub>(w<sub>j</sub>)</i>.
 *
 * <li>Compute the basis <i>v<sub>j</sub></i> of the finite element shape
 * function space by applying <i>M<sup>-1</sup></i> to the basis
 * <i>w<sub>j</sub></i>.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The function computing the matrix <i>M</i> for you is
 * FETools::compute_node_matrix(). It relies on the existence of
 * #generalized_support_points and implementation of interpolate() with
 * VectorSlice argument. See the
 * @ref GlossGeneralizedSupport "glossary entry on generalized support points"
 * for more information.
 *
 * The piece of code in the constructor of a finite element responsible for
 * this looks like
 * @code
 * FullMatrix<double> M(this->dofs_per_cell, this->dofs_per_cell);
 * FETools::compute_node_matrix(M, *this);
 * this->inverse_node_matrix.reinit(this->dofs_per_cell, this->dofs_per_cell);
 * this->inverse_node_matrix.invert(M);
 * @endcode
 * Don't forget to make sure that #unit_support_points or
 * #generalized_support_points are initialized before this!
 *
 * <h5>Computing the #prolongation matrices for multigrid</h5>
 *
 * Once the shape functions are set up, the grid transfer matrices for
 * Multigrid accessed by get_prolongation_matrix() can be computed
 * automatically, using FETools::compute_embedding_matrices().
 *
 * This can be achieved by
 * @code
 * for (unsigned int i=0; i<GeometryInfo<dim>::children_per_cell; ++i)
 * this->prolongation[i].reinit (this->dofs_per_cell,
 * this->dofs_per_cell);
 * FETools::compute_embedding_matrices (*this, this->prolongation);
 * @endcode
 *
 * <h5>Computing the #restriction matrices for error estimators</h5>
 *
 * missing...
 *
 * <h5>Computing #interface_constraints</h5>
 *
 * Constraint matrices can be computed semi-automatically using
 * FETools::compute_face_embedding_matrices(). This function computes the
 * representation of the coarse mesh functions by fine mesh functions for each
 * child of a face separately. These matrices must be convoluted into a single
 * rectangular constraint matrix, eliminating degrees of freedom on common
 * vertices and edges as well as on the coarse grid vertices. See the
 * discussion above for details.
