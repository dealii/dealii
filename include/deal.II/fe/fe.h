/**
 * This is the base class for finite elements in arbitrary dimensions. It
 * declares the interface both in terms of member variables and public member
 * functions through which properties of a concrete implementation of a finite
 * element can be accessed. This interface generally consists of a number of
 * groups of variables and functions that can roughly be delineated as
 * follows:
 * - Basic information about the finite element, such as the number of
 * degrees of freedom per vertex, edge, or cell. This kind of data is stored
 * in the FiniteElementData base class. (Though the FiniteElement::get_name()
 * member function also falls into this category.)
 * - A description of the shape functions and their derivatives on the
 * reference cell $[0,1]^d$, if an element is indeed defined by mapping shape
 * functions from the reference cell to an actual cell.
 * - Matrices (and functions that access them) that describe how an
 * element's shape functions related to those on parent or child cells
 * (restriction or prolongation) or neighboring cells (for hanging node
 * constraints), as well as to other finite element spaces defined on the same
 * cell (e.g., when doing $p$ refinement).
 * - %Functions that describe the properties of individual shape functions,
 * for example which
 * @ref GlossComponent "vector components"
 * of a
 * @ref vector_valued "vector-valued finite element's"
 * shape function is nonzero, or whether an element is
 * @ref GlossPrimitive "primitive".
 * - For elements that are interpolatory, such as the common $Q_p$
 * Lagrange elements, data that describes where their
 * @ref GlossSupport "support points"
 * are located.
 * - %Functions that define the interface to the FEValues class that is
 * almost always used to access finite element shape functions from user code.
 *
 * The following sections discuss many of these concepts in more detail, and
 * outline strategies by which concrete implementations of a finite element
 * can provide the details necessary for a complete description of a finite
 * element space.
 *
 * As a general rule, there are three ways by which derived classes provide
 * this information:
 * - A number of fields that are generally easy to compute and that
 * are initialized by the constructor of this class (or the constructor of the
 * FiniteElementData base class) and derived classes therefore have to compute
 * in the process of calling this class's constructor. This is, specifically,
 * the case for the basic information and parts of the descriptive information
 * about shape functions mentioned above.
 * - Some common matrices that are widely used in the library and for
 * which this class provides protected member variables that the constructors
 * of derived classes need to fill. The purpose of providing these matrices in
 * this class is that (i) they are frequently used, and (ii) they are
 * expensive to compute. Consequently, it makes sense to only compute them
 * once, rather than every time they are used. In most cases, the constructor
 * of the current class already sets them to their correct size, and derived
 * classes therefore only have to fill them. Examples of this include the
 * matrices that relate the shape functions on one cell to the shape functions
 * on neighbors, children, and parents.
 * - Uncommon information, or information that depends on specific input
 * arguments, and that needs to be implemented by derived classes. For these,
 * this base class only declares abstract virtual member functions and derived
 * classes then have to implement them. Examples of this category would
 * include the functions that compute values and derivatives of shape
 * functions on the reference cell for which it is not possible to tabulate
 * values because there are infinitely many points at which one may want to
 * evaluate them. In some cases, derived classes may choose to simply not
 * implement <i>all</i> possible interfaces (or may not <i>yet</i> have a
 * complete implementation); for uncommon functions, there is then often a
 * member function derived classes can overload that describes whether a
 * particular feature is implemented. An example is whether an element
 * implements the information necessary to use it in the $hp$ finite element
 * context (see
 * @ref hp "hp finite element support").
 *
 *
 * <h3>Nomenclature</h3>
 *
 * Finite element classes have to define a large number of different
 * properties describing  a finite element space. The following subsections
 * describe some nomenclature that will be used in the documentation below.
 *
 * <h4>Components and blocks</h4>
 *
 * @ref vector_valued "Vector-valued finite element"
 * are elements used for systems of partial differential equations.
 * Oftentimes, they are composed via the FESystem class (which is itself
 * derived from the current class), but there are also non-composed elements
 * that have multiple components (for example the FE_Nedelec and
 * FE_RaviartThomas classes, among others). For any of these vector valued
 * elements, individual shape functions may be nonzero in one or several
 * @ref GlossComponent "components"
 * of the vector valued function. If the element is
 * @ref GlossPrimitive "primitive",
 * there is indeed a single component with a nonzero entry for each shape
 * function. This component can be determined using the
 * FiniteElement::system_to_component_index() function.
 *
 * On the other hand, if there is at least one shape function that is nonzero
 * in more than one vector component, then we call the entire element "non-
 * primitive". The FiniteElement::get_nonzero_components() can then be used to
 * determine which vector components of a shape function are nonzero. The
 * number of nonzero components of a shape function is returned by
 * FiniteElement::n_components(). Whether a shape function is non-primitive
 * can be queried by FiniteElement::is_primitive().
 *
 * Oftentimes, one may want to split linear system into blocks so that they
 * reflect the structure of the underlying operator. This is typically not
 * done based on vector components, but based on the use of
 * @ref GlossBlock "blocks",
 * and the result is then used to substructure objects of type BlockVector,
 * BlockSparseMatrix, BlockMatrixArray, and so on. If you use non-primitive
 * elements, you cannot determine the block number by
 * FiniteElement::system_to_component_index(). Instead, you can use
 * FiniteElement::system_to_block_index(). The number of blocks of a finite
 * element can be determined by FiniteElement::n_blocks().
 *
 *
 * <h4>Support points</h4>
 *
 * Finite elements are frequently defined by defining a polynomial space and a
 * set of dual functionals. If these functionals involve point evaluations,
 * then the element is "interpolatory" and it is possible to interpolate an
 * arbitrary (but sufficiently smooth) function onto the finite element space
 * by evaluating it at these points. We call these points "support points".
 *
 * Most finite elements are defined by mapping from the reference cell to a
 * concrete cell. Consequently, the support points are then defined on the
 * reference ("unit") cell, see
 * @ref GlossSupport "this glossary entry".
 * The support points on a concrete cell can then be computed by mapping the
 * unit support points, using the Mapping class interface and derived classes,
 * typically via the FEValues class.
 *
 * A typical code snippet to do so would look as follows:
 * @code
 * Quadrature<dim> dummy_quadrature (fe.get_unit_support_points());
 * FEValues<dim>   fe_values (mapping, fe, dummy_quadrature,
 *                            update_quadrature_points);
 * fe_values.reinit (cell);
 * Point<dim> mapped_point = fe_values.quadrature_point (i);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, the points can be transformed one-by-one:
 * @code
 * const vector<Point<dim> > &unit_points =
 *    fe.get_unit_support_points();
 *
 * Point<dim> mapped_point =
 *    mapping.transform_unit_to_real_cell (cell, unit_points[i]);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Finite elements' implementation of the get_unit_support_points()
 * function returns these points in the same order as shape functions. As a
 * consequence, the quadrature points accessed above are also ordered in this
 * way. The order of shape functions is typically documented in the class
 * documentation of the various finite element classes.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Implementing finite element spaces in derived classes</h3>
 *
 * The following sections provide some more guidance for implementing concrete
 * finite element spaces in derived classes. This includes information that
 * depends on the dimension for which you want to provide something, followed
 * by a list of tools helping to generate information in concrete cases.
 *
 * It is important to note that there is a number of intermediate classes that
 * can do a lot of what is necessary for a complete description of finite
 * element spaces. For example, the FE_Poly, FE_PolyTensor, and FE_PolyFace
 * classes in essence build a complete finite element space if you only
 * provide them with an abstract description of the polynomial space upon
 * which you want to build an element. Using these intermediate classes
 * typically makes implementing finite element descriptions vastly simpler.
 *
 * As a general rule, if you want to implement an element, you will likely
 * want to look at the implementation of other, similar elements first. Since
 * many of the more complicated pieces of a finite element interface have to
 * do with how they interact with mappings, quadrature, and the FEValues
 * class, you will also want to read through the
 * @ref FE_vs_Mapping_vs_FEValues
 * documentation module.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Interpolation matrices in one dimension</h4>
 *
 * In one space dimension (i.e., for <code>dim==1</code> and any value of
 * <code>spacedim</code>), finite element classes implementing the interface
 * of the current base class need only set the #restriction and #prolongation
 * matrices that describe the interpolation of the finite element space on one
 * cell to that of its parent cell, and to that on its children, respectively.
 * The constructor of the current class in one dimension presets the
 * #interface_constraints matrix (used to describe hanging node constraints at
 * the interface between cells of different refinement levels) to have size
 * zero because there are no hanging nodes in 1d.
 *
 * <h4>Interpolation matrices in two dimensions</h4>
 *
 * In addition to the fields discussed above for 1D, a constraint matrix is
 * needed to describe hanging node constraints if the finite element has
 * degrees of freedom located on edges or vertices. These constraints are
 * represented by an $m\times n$-matrix #interface_constraints, where <i>m</i>
 * is the number of degrees of freedom on the refined side without the corner
 * vertices (those dofs on the middle vertex plus those on the two lines), and
 * <i>n</i> is that of the unrefined side (those dofs on the two vertices plus
 * those on the line). The matrix is thus a rectangular one. The $m\times n$
 * size of the #interface_constraints matrix can also be accessed through the
 * interface_constraints_size() function.
 *
 * The mapping of the dofs onto the indices of the matrix on the unrefined
 * side is as follows: let $d_v$ be the number of dofs on a vertex, $d_l$ that
 * on a line, then $n=0...d_v-1$ refers to the dofs on vertex zero of the
 * unrefined line, $n=d_v...2d_v-1$ to those on vertex one,
 * $n=2d_v...2d_v+d_l-1$ to those on the line.
 *
 * Similarly, $m=0...d_v-1$ refers to the dofs on the middle vertex of the
 * refined side (vertex one of child line zero, vertex zero of child line
 * one), $m=d_v...d_v+d_l-1$ refers to the dofs on child line zero,
 * $m=d_v+d_l...d_v+2d_l-1$ refers to the dofs on child line one.  Please note
 * that we do not need to reserve space for the dofs on the end vertices of
 * the refined lines, since these must be mapped one-to-one to the appropriate
 * dofs of the vertices of the unrefined line.
 *
 * Through this construction, the degrees of freedom on the child faces are
 * constrained to the degrees of freedom on the parent face. The information
 * so provided is typically consumed by the
 * DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints() function.
 *
 * @note The hanging node constraints described by these matrices are only
 * relevant to the case where the same finite element space is used on
 * neighboring (but differently refined) cells. The case that the finite
 * element spaces on different sides of a face are different, i.e., the $hp$
 * case (see
 * @ref hp "hp finite element support")
 * is handled by separate functions. See the
 * FiniteElement::get_face_interpolation_matrix() and
 * FiniteElement::get_subface_interpolation_matrix() functions.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Interpolation matrices in three dimensions</h4>
 *
 * For the interface constraints, the 3d case is similar to the 2d case. The
 * numbering for the indices $n$ on the mother face is obvious and keeps to
 * the usual numbering of degrees of freedom on quadrilaterals.
 *
 * The numbering of the degrees of freedom on the interior of the refined
 * faces for the index $m$ is as follows: let $d_v$ and $d_l$ be as above, and
 * $d_q$ be the number of degrees of freedom per quadrilateral (and therefore
 * per face), then $m=0...d_v-1$ denote the dofs on the vertex at the center,
 * $m=d_v...5d_v-1$ for the dofs on the vertices at the center of the bounding
 * lines of the quadrilateral, $m=5d_v..5d_v+4*d_l-1$ are for the degrees of
 * freedom on the four lines connecting the center vertex to the outer
 * boundary of the mother face, $m=5d_v+4*d_l...5d_v+4*d_l+8*d_l-1$ for the
 * degrees of freedom on the small lines surrounding the quad, and
 * $m=5d_v+12*d_l...5d_v+12*d_l+4*d_q-1$ for the dofs on the four child faces.
 * Note the direction of the lines at the boundary of the quads, as shown
 * below.
 *
 * The order of the twelve lines and the four child faces can be extracted
 * from the following sketch, where the overall order of the different dof
 * groups is depicted:
 * @verbatim
 *    *--15--4--16--*
 *    |      |      |
 *    10 19  6  20  12
 *    |      |      |
 *    1--7---0--8---2
 *    |      |      |
 *    9  17  5  18  11
 *    |      |      |
 *    *--13--3--14--*
 * @endverbatim
 * The numbering of vertices and lines, as well as the numbering of children
 * within a line is consistent with the one described in Triangulation.
 * Therefore, this numbering is seen from the outside and inside,
 * respectively, depending on the face.
 *
 * The three-dimensional case has a few pitfalls available for derived classes
 * that want to implement constraint matrices. Consider the following case:
 * @verbatim
 *          *-------*
 *         /       /|
 *        /       / |
 *       /       /  |
 *      *-------*   |
 *      |       |   *-------*
 *      |       |  /       /|
 *      |   1   | /       / |
 *      |       |/       /  |
 *      *-------*-------*   |
 *      |       |       |   *
 *      |       |       |  /
 *      |   2   |   3   | /
 *      |       |       |/
 *      *-------*-------*
 * @endverbatim
 * Now assume that we want to refine cell 2. We will end up with two faces
 * with hanging nodes, namely the faces between cells 1 and 2, as well as
 * between cells 2 and 3. Constraints have to be applied to the degrees of
 * freedom on both these faces. The problem is that there is now an edge (the
 * top right one of cell 2) which is part of both faces. The hanging node(s)
 * on this edge are therefore constrained twice, once from both faces. To be
 * meaningful, these constraints of course have to be consistent: both faces
 * have to constrain the hanging nodes on the edge to the same nodes on the
 * coarse edge (and only on the edge, as there can then be no constraints to
 * nodes on the rest of the face), and they have to do so with the same
 * weights. This is sometimes tricky since the nodes on the edge may have
 * different local numbers.
 *
 * For the constraint matrix this means the following: if a degree of freedom
 * on one edge of a face is constrained by some other nodes on the same edge
 * with some weights, then the weights have to be exactly the same as those
 * for constrained nodes on the three other edges with respect to the
 * corresponding nodes on these edges. If this isn't the case, you will get
 * into trouble with the ConstraintMatrix class that is the primary consumer
 * of the constraint information: while that class is able to handle
 * constraints that are entered more than once (as is necessary for the case
 * above), it insists that the weights are exactly the same.
 *
 * Using this scheme, child face degrees of freedom are constrained against
 * parent face degrees of freedom that contain those on the edges of the
 * parent face; it is possible that some of them are in turn constrained
 * themselves, leading to longer chains of constraints that the
 * ConstraintMatrix class will eventually have to sort out. (The constraints
 * described above are used by the DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints()
 * function that constructs a ConstraintMatrix object.) However, this is of no
 * concern for the FiniteElement and derived classes since they only act
 * locally on one cell and its immediate neighbor, and do not see the bigger
 * picture. The
 * @ref hp_paper
 * details how such chains are handled in practice.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Helper functions</h4>
 *
 * Construction of a finite element and computation of the matrices described
 * above is often a tedious task, in particular if it has to be performed for
 * several dimensions. Most of this work can be avoided by using the
 * intermediate classes already mentioned above (e.g., FE_Poly, FE_PolyTensor,
 * etc). Other tasks can be automated by some of the functions in namespace
 * FETools.
 *
 * <h5>Computing the correct basis from a set of linearly independent
 * functions</h5>
 *
 * First, it may already be difficult to compute the basis of shape functions
 * for arbitrary order and dimension. On the other hand, if the
 * @ref GlossNodes "node values"
 * are given, then the duality relation between node functionals and basis
 * functions defines the basis. As a result, the shape function space may be
 * defined from a set of linearly independent functions, such that the actual
 * finite element basis is computed from linear combinations of them. The
 * coefficients of these combinations are determined by the duality of node
 * values and form a matrix.
 *
 * Using this matrix allows the construction of the basis of shape functions
 * in two steps.
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>Define the space of shape functions using an arbitrary basis
 * <i>w<sub>j</sub></i> and compute the matrix <i>M</i> of node functionals
 * <i>N<sub>i</sub></i> applied to these basis functions, such that its
 * entries are <i>m<sub>ij</sub> = N<sub>i</sub>(w<sub>j</sub>)</i>.
 *
 * <li>Compute the basis <i>v<sub>j</sub></i> of the finite element shape
 * function space by applying <i>M<sup>-1</sup></i> to the basis
 * <i>w<sub>j</sub></i>.
 * </ol>
 *
 * The matrix <i>M</i> may be computed using FETools::compute_node_matrix().
 * This function relies on the existence of #generalized_support_points and an
 * implementation of the FiniteElement::interpolate() function with
 * VectorSlice argument. (See the
 * @ref GlossGeneralizedSupport "glossary entry on generalized support points"
 * for more information.) With this, one can then use the following piece of
 * code in the constructor of a class derived from FinitElement to compute the
 * $M$ matrix:
 * @code
 * FullMatrix<double> M(this->dofs_per_cell, this->dofs_per_cell);
 * FETools::compute_node_matrix(M, *this);
 * this->inverse_node_matrix.reinit(this->dofs_per_cell, this->dofs_per_cell);
 * this->inverse_node_matrix.invert(M);
 * @endcode
 * Don't forget to make sure that #unit_support_points or
 * #generalized_support_points are initialized before this!
 *
 * <h5>Computing prolongation matrices</h5>
 *
 * Once you have shape functions, you can define matrices that transfer data
 * from one cell to its children or the other way around. This is a common
 * operation in multigrid, of course, but is also used when interpolating the
 * solution from one mesh to another after mesh refinement, as well as in the
 * definition of some error estimators.
 *
 * To define the prolongation matrices, i.e., those matrices that describe the
 * transfer of a finite element field from one cell to its children,
 * implementations of finite elements can either fill the #prolongation array
 * by hand, or can call FETools::compute_embedding_matrices().
 *
 * In the latter case, all that is required is the following piece of code:
 * @code
 * for (unsigned int c=0; c<GeometryInfo<dim>::max_children_per_cell; ++c)
 *   this->prolongation[c].reinit (this->dofs_per_cell,
 *                                 this->dofs_per_cell);
 * FETools::compute_embedding_matrices (*this, this->prolongation);
 * @endcode
 * As in this example, prolongation is almost always implemented via
 * embedding, i.e., the nodal values of the function on the children may be
 * different from the nodal values of the function on the parent cell, but as
 * a function of $\mathbf x\in{\mathbb R}^\text{spacedim}$, the finite element
 * field on the child is the same as on the parent.
 *
 *
 * <h5>Computing restriction matrices</h5>
 *
 * The opposite operation, restricting a finite element function defined on
 * the children to the parent cell is typically implemented by interpolating
 * the finite element function on the children to the nodal values of the
 * parent cell. In deal.II, the restriction operation is implemented as a loop
 * over the children of a cell that each apply a matrix to the vector of
 * unknowns on that child cell (these matrices are stored in #restriction and
 * are accessed by get_restriction_matrix()). The operation that then needs to
 * be implemented turns out to be surprisingly difficult to describe, but is
 * instructive to describe because it also defines the meaning of the
 * #restriction_is_additive_flags array (accessed via the
 * restriction_is_additive() function).
 *
 * To give a concrete example, assume we use a $Q_1$ element in 1d, and that
 * on each of the parent and child cells degrees of freedom are (locally and
 * globally) numbered as follows:
 * @code
 * meshes:             *-------*                        *---*---*
 * local DoF numbers:  0       1                        0  1|0  1
 * global DoF numbers: 0       1                        0   1   2
 * @endcode
 * Then we want the restriction operation to take the value of the zeroth DoF
 * on child 0 as the value of the zeroth DoF on the parent, and take the value
 * of the first DoF on child 1 as the value of the first DoF on the parent.
 * Ideally, we would like to write this follows
 * @f[
 *   U^\text{coarse}|_\text{parent}
 *   = \sum_{\text{child}=0}^1 R_\text{child} U^\text{fine}|_\text{child}
 * @f]
 * where $U^\text{fine}|_\text{child=0}=(U^\text{fine}_0,U^\text{fine}_1)^T$
 * and $U^\text{fine}|_\text{child=1}=(U^\text{fine}_1,U^\text{fine}_2)^T$.
 * Writing the requested operation like this would here be possible by
 * choosing
 * @f[
 *   R_0 = \left(\begin{matrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{matrix}\right),
 *   \qquad\qquad
 *   R_1 = \left(\begin{matrix}0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right).
 * @f]
 * However, this approach already fails if we go to a $Q_2$ element with the
 * following degrees of freedom:
 * @code
 * meshes:             *-------*                        *----*----*
 * local DoF numbers:  0   2   1                        0 2 1|0 2 1
 * global DoF numbers: 0   2   1                        0 2  1  4 3
 * @endcode
 * Writing things as the sum over matrix operations as above would not easily
 * work because we have to add nonzero values to $U^\text{coarse}_2$ twice,
 * once for each child.
 *
 * Consequently, restriction is typically implemented as a
 * <i>concatenation</i> operation. I.e., we first compute the individual
 * restrictions from each child,
 * @f[
 *   \tilde U^\text{coarse}_\text{child}
 *   = R_\text{child} U^\text{fine}|_\text{child},
 * @f]
 * and then compute the values of $U^\text{coarse}|_\text{parent}$ with the
 * following code:
 * @code
 * for (unsigned int child=0; child<cell->n_children(); ++child)
 *   for (unsigned int i=0; i<dofs_per_cell; ++i)
 *     if (U_tilde_coarse[child][i] != 0)
 *       U_coarse_on_parent[i] = U_tilde_coarse[child][i];
 * @endcode
 * In other words, each nonzero element of $\tilde
 * U^\text{coarse}_\text{child}$ <i>overwrites</i>, rather than adds to the
 * corresponding element of $U^\text{coarse}|_\text{parent}$. This typically
 * also implies that the restriction matrices from two different cells should
 * agree on a value for coarse degrees of freedom that they both want to touch
 * (otherwise the result would depend on the order in which we loop over
 * children, which would be unreasonable because the order of children is an
 * otherwise arbitrary convention). For example, in the example above, the
 * restriction matrices will be
 * @f[
 *   R_0 = \left(\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{matrix}\right),
 *   \qquad\qquad
 *   R_1 = \left(\begin{matrix}0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{matrix}\right),
 * @f]
 * and the compatibility condition is the $R_{0,21}=R_{1,20}$ because they
 * both indicate that $U^\text{coarse}|_\text{parent,2}$ should be set to one
 * times $U^\text{fine}|_\text{child=0,1}$ and
 * $U^\text{fine}|_\text{child=1,0}$.
 *
 * Unfortunately, not all finite elements allow to write the restriction
 * operation in this way. For example, for the piecewise constant FE_DGQ(0)
 * element, the value of the finite element field on the parent cell can not
 * be determined by interpolation from the children. Rather, the only
 * reasonable choice is to take it as the <i>average</i> value between the
 * children -- so we are back to the sum operation, rather than the
 * concatenation. Further thought shows that whether restriction should be
 * additive or not is a property of the individual shape function, not of the
 * finite element as a whole. Consequently, the
 * FiniteElement::restriction_is_additive() function returns whether a
 * particular shape function should act via concatenation (a return value of
 * @p false) or via addition (return value of @p true), and the correct code
 * for the overall operation is then as follows (and as, in fact, implemented
 * in DoFAccessor::get_interpolated_dof_values()):

   * A base class for internal data that derived finite element classes may
   * wish to store.
   *
   * The class is used as follows: Whenever an FEValues (or FEFaceValues or
   * FESubfaceValues) object is initialized, it requests that the finite
   * element it is associated with creates an object of a class derived from
   * the current one here. This is done via each derived class's
   * FiniteElement::get_data() function. This object is then passed to the
   * FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(), FiniteElement::fill_fe_face_values(),
   * and FiniteElement::fill_fe_subface_values() functions as a constant
   * object. The intent of these objects is so that finite element classes can
   * pre-compute information once at the beginning (in the call to
   * FiniteElement::get_data() call) that can then be used on each cell that
   * is subsequently visited. An example for this is the values of shape
   * functions at the quadrature point of the reference cell, which remain the
   * same no matter the cell visited, and that can therefore be computed once
   * at the beginning and reused later on.
   *
   * Because only derived classes can know what they can pre-compute, each
   * derived class that wants to store information computed once at the
   * beginning, needs to derive its own InternalData class from this class,
   * and return an object of the derived type through its get_data() function.

   * @ref GlossFaceOrientation.
   * @param face_flip One part of the description of the orientation of the
   * face. See
   * @ref GlossFaceOrientation.
   * @param face_rotation One part of the description of the orientation of

   * @ref GlossFaceOrientation.
   * @return The index of this degree of freedom within the set of degrees of

   * degrees of freedom on this face, or whether they are immune from this.
   * For this, consider the situation of a $Q_3$ element in 2d. If face_flip
   * is true, then we need to consider the two degrees of freedom on the edge
   * in reverse order. On the other hand, if the element were a $Q_1^2$, then
   * because the two degrees of freedom on this edge belong to different
   * vector components, they should not be considered in reverse order. What
   * all of this shows is that the function can't work if there are more than
   * one degree of freedom per line or quad, and that in these cases the
   * function will throw an exception pointing out that this functionality
   * will need to be provided by a derived class that knows what degrees of

   * passed to the FiniteElement::fill_fe_values() every time the finite
   * element shape functions and their derivatives are evaluated on a concrete

   * every cell (e.g., for evaluating the values and gradients of shape
   * functions on the reference cell, for later re-use when transforming these
   * values to a concrete cell).
   *
   * This function is the first one called in the process of initializing a
   * FEValues object for a given mapping and finite element object. The
   * returned object will later be passed to FiniteElement::fill_fe_values()
   * for a concrete cell, which will itself place its output into an object of
   * type internal::FEValues::FiniteElementRelatedData. Since there may be
   * data that can already be computed in its <i>final</i> form on the
   * reference cell, this function also receives a reference to the
   * internal::FEValues::FiniteElementRelatedData object as its last argument.
   * This output argument is guaranteed to always be the same one when used
   * with the InternalDataBase object returned by this function. In other
   * words, the subdivision of scratch data and final data in the returned
   * object and the @p output_data object is as follows: If data can be pre-
   * computed on the reference cell in the exact form in which it will later
   * be needed on a concrete cell, then this function should already emplace
   * it in the @p output_data object. An example are the values of shape
   * functions at quadrature points for the usual Lagrange elements which on a
   * concrete cell are identical to the ones on the reference cell. On the
   * other hand, if some data can be pre-computed to make computations on a
   * concrete cell <i>cheaper</i>, then it should be put into the returned
   * object for later re-use in a derive class's implementation of
   * FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(). An example are the gradients of shape
   * functions on the reference cell for Lagrange elements: to compute the
   * gradients of the shape functions on a concrete cell, one has to multiply
   * the gradients on the reference cell by the inverse of the Jacobian of the
   * mapping; consequently, we cannot already compute the gradients on a
   * concrete cell at the time the current function is called, but we can at
   * least pre-compute the gradients on the reference cell, and store it in
   * the object returned.

   * before this function is called, or by calling the member functions of a
   * Mapping object with the @p mapping_internal object that also corresponds
   * to the current cell.
   *
   * The information computed by this function is used to fill the various

   * of the quadrature points represented by this object.

   * to transform gradients and higher derivatives from the reference to the
   * current cell.

   * Mapping::fill_fe_values() function wrote the mapping information
   * corresponding to the current cell. This includes, for example, Jacobians
   * of the mapping that may be of relevance to the current function, as well
   * as other information that FEValues::reinit() requested from the mapping.
