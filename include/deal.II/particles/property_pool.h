   * This class manages a memory space in which all particles associated with

   *
   * The rationale for this class is
   * that because typically every particle stores the same number of
   * properties, and because algorithms generally traverse over all particles
   * doing the same operation on all particles' properties, it is more efficient
   * to let the memory used for properties be handled by a central manager.
   * Particles then do not store a pointer to a memory area in which they store
   * their properties, but instead a "handle" that the PropertyPool class then
   * translates into a pointer to concrete memory.
   *
   * All this said, the current implementation only provides this kind of
   * interface, but still uses simple new/delete allocation for every
   * set of properties requested by a particle. Additionally, the current
   * implementation assumes the same number of properties per particle, but of
   * course the PropertyType could contain a pointer to dynamically allocated
   * memory with varying sizes per particle (this memory would not be managed by
   * this class).
