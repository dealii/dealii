     * A function that generates one particle at a random location in cell @p cell and with

     * and destruction of a generator for every particle and optionally takes

     * function is described in @cite GLHPW2018. In short, the algorithm
     * generates
     * random locations within the bounding box of the @p cell. It then inverts the mapping
     * to check if the generated particle is within the cell itself. This makes
     * sure the algorithm produces statistically random locations even for
     * nonlinear mappings and distorted cells. However, if the ratio between
     * bounding box and cell volume becomes very large -- i.e. the cells become
     * strongly deformed, for example a pencil shaped cell that lies diagonally
     * in the domain -- then the algorithm can become very inefficient.
     * Therefore, it only tries to find a location ni the cell a fixed number of
