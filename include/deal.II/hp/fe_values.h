  /**
   * An hp-equivalent of the ::FEValues class. See the step-27 tutorial
   * program for examples of use.
   *
   * The idea of this class is as follows: when one assembled matrices in the
   * hp-finite element method, there may be different finite elements on
   * different cells, and consequently one may also want to use different
   * quadrature formulas for different cells. On the other hand, the
   * ::FEValues efficiently handles pre-evaluating whatever information is
   * necessary for a single finite element and quadrature object. This class
   * brings these concepts together: it provides a "collection" of ::FEValues
   * objects.
   *
   * Upon construction, one passes not one finite element and quadrature
   * object (and possible a mapping), but a whole collection of type
   * hp::FECollection and hp::QCollection. Later on, when one sits on a
   * concrete cell, one would call the reinit() function for this particular
   * cell, just as one does for a regular ::FEValues object. The difference is
   * that this time, the reinit() function looks up the active FE index of
   * that cell, if necessary creates a ::FEValues object that matches the
   * finite element and quadrature formulas with that particular index in
   * their collections, and then re-initializes it for the current cell. The
   * ::FEValues object that then fits the finite element and quadrature
   * formula for the current cell can then be accessed using the
   * get_present_fe_values() function, and one would work with it just like
   * with any ::FEValues object for non-hp-DoFHandler objects.
   *
   * The reinit() functions have additional arguments with default values. If
   * not specified, the function takes the index into the hp::FECollection,
   * hp::QCollection, and hp::MappingCollection objects from the
   * active FE index of the cell, as explained above. However, one can also
   * select different indices for a current cell. For example, by specifying a
   * different index into the hp::QCollection class, one does not need to sort
   * the quadrature objects in the quadrature collection so that they match
   * one-to-one the order of finite element objects in the FE collection (even
   * though choosing such an order is certainly convenient).
   *
   * Note that ::FEValues objects are created on the fly, i.e. only as they
   * are needed. This ensures that we do not create objects for every
   * combination of finite element, quadrature formula and mapping, but only
   * those that will actually be needed. Alternatively if desired, this
   * can be bypassed by computing all objects in advance with the corresponding
   * hp::FEValuesBase::precalculate_fe_values() function.
   *
   * This class has not yet been implemented for the use in the codimension
   * one case (<tt>spacedim != dim </tt>).

     * with the present cell. On the other hand, if a value is given for this
     * argument, it overrides the choice of
     * <code>cell-@>active_fe_index()</code>.
     *
     * If the @p q_index argument is left at its default value, then we use
     * that quadrature formula within the hp::QCollection passed to the
     * constructor of this class with index given by
     * <code>cell-@>active_fe_index()</code>, i.e. the same index as that of
     * the finite element. In this case, there should be a corresponding
     * quadrature formula for each finite element in the hp::FECollection. As
     * a special case, if the quadrature collection contains only a single
     * element (a frequent case if one wants to use the same quadrature object
     * for all finite elements in an hp-discretization, even if that may not
     * be the most efficient), then this single quadrature is used unless a
     * different value for this argument is specified. On the other hand, if a
     * value is given for this argument, it overrides the choice of
     * <code>cell-@>active_fe_index()</code> or the choice for the single
     * quadrature.
     *
     * If the @p mapping_index argument is left at its default value, then we
     * use that mapping object within the hp::MappingCollection passed to the
     * constructor of this class with index given by
     * <code>cell-@>active_fe_index()</code>, i.e. the same index as that of

     * After the call, you can get an FESubfaceValues object using the
     * get_present_fe_values() function that corresponds to the present cell.
     * For this FESubfaceValues object, we use the additional arguments
     * described below to determine which finite element, mapping, and
     * quadrature formula to use. They are order in such a way that the
     * arguments one may want to change most frequently come first. The rules
     * for these arguments are as follows:
     *
     * If the @p q_index argument is left at its default value, then we use
     * that quadrature formula within the hp::QCollection passed to the
     * constructor of this class with index given by
     * <code>cell-@>active_fe_index()</code>, i.e. the same index as that of
     * the finite element. In this case, there should be a corresponding
     * quadrature formula for each finite element in the hp::FECollection. As
     * a special case, if the quadrature collection contains only a single
     * element (a frequent case if one wants to use the same quadrature object
     * for all finite elements in an hp-discretization, even if that may not
     * be the most efficient), then this single quadrature is used unless a
     * different value for this argument is specified. On the other hand, if a
     * value is given for this argument, it overrides the choice of
     * <code>cell-@>active_fe_index()</code> or the choice for the single
     * quadrature.
     *
     * If the @p mapping_index argument is left at its default value, then we
     * use that mapping object within the hp::MappingCollection passed to the
     * constructor of this class with index given by
     * <code>cell-@>active_fe_index()</code>, i.e. the same index as that of
     * the finite element. As above, if the mapping collection contains only a
     * single element (a frequent case if one wants to use a $Q_1$ mapping for
     * all finite elements in an hp-discretization), then this single mapping
     * is used unless a different value for this argument is specified.
