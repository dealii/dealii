  /**
   * @todo Update this documentation and the one of Operator
   *
   * The abstract base class of all algorithms in this library. An operator is
   * an object with an operator(), which transforms a set of named vectors
   * into another set of named vectors.
   *
   * Furthermore, an operator can be notified of parameter changes by the
   * calling routine. The outer iteration can notify() the Operator of an
   * Event, which could be for instance a change of mesh, a different time
   * step size or too slow convergence of Newton's method, which would then
   * trigger reassembling of a matrix or similar things.
   *
   * <h3>Usage for nested iterations</h3>
   *
   * This is probably the most prominent use for Operator, where an outer
   * iterative method calls an inner solver and so on. Typically, the
   * innermost method in such a nested system will have to compute a residual
   * using values from all outer iterations. Since the depth and order of such
   * a nesting is hardly predictable when designing a general tool, we use
   * AnyData to access these vectors. Typically, the first vector in
   * <tt>out</tt> contains the start vector when operator()() is called, and
   * the solution when the function returns. The object <tt>in</tt> is
   * providing additional information and forwarded to the inner Operator
   * objects of the nested iteration.
