  /**
   * Operator class performing Newton's iteration with standard step size
   * control and adaptive matrix generation.
   *
   * This class performs a Newton iteration up to convergence determined by
   * #control. If after an update the norm of the residual has become larger,
   * then step size control is activated and the update is subsequently
   * divided by two until the residual actually becomes smaller (or the
   * minimal scaling factor determined by #n_stepsize_iterations is reached).
   *
   * Since assembling matrices, depending on the implementation, tends to be
   * costly, this method applies an adaptive reassembling strategy. Only if
   * the reduction factor for the residual is more than #threshold, the event
   * Algorithms::bad_derivative is submitted to #inverse_derivative. It is up
   * to this object to implement reassembling accordingly.
   *
   * <h3>Contents of the AnyData objects</h3>
   *
   * The only value used by the Newton method is the first vector in the
   * parameter <tt>out</tt> of operator()(). It serves as the start vector of
   * Newton's method and in the end contains the solution. All other vectors
   * of <tt>out</tt> are ignored by Newton's method and its inner Operator
   * objects. All vectors of <tt>in</tt> are forwarded to the inner Operator
   * objects, with additional information added as follows.
   *
   * When calling (*#residual)(), the AnyData <tt>in</tt> given to the Newton
   * iteration is prepended by a vector <tt>"Newton iterate"</tt>, the current
   * value of the Newton iterate, which can be used to evaluate the residual
   * at this point.
   *
   * For the call to (*#inverse_derivative), the vector <tt>"Newton
   * residual"</tt> is inserted before <tt>"Newton iterate"</tt>.
