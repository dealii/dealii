  /**
   * Application class performing the theta timestepping scheme.
   *
   * The theta scheme is an abstraction of implicit and explicit Euler
   * schemes, the Crank-Nicholson scheme and linear combinations of those. The
   * choice of the actual scheme is controlled by the parameter #theta as
   * follows.
   * <ul>
   * <li> #theta=0: explicit Euler scheme
   * <li> #theta=1: implicit Euler scheme
   * <li> #theta=½: Crank-Nicholson scheme
   * </ul>
   *
   * For fixed #theta, the Crank-Nicholson scheme is the only second order
   * scheme. Nevertheless, further stability may be achieved by choosing
   * #theta larger than ½, thereby introducing a first order error term. In
   * order to avoid a loss of convergence order, the adaptive theta scheme can
   * be used, where <i>#theta=½+c dt</i>.
   *
   * Assume that we want to solve the equation <i>u' + F(u) = 0</i> with a
   * step size <i>k</i>.  A step of the theta scheme can be written as
   *
   * @f[
   *   M u_{n+1} + \theta k F(u_{n+1})  = M u_n - (1-\theta)k F(u_n).
   * @f]
   *
   * Here, <i>M</i> is the mass matrix. We see, that the right hand side
   * amounts to an explicit Euler step with modified step size in weak form
   * (up to inversion of M). The left hand side corresponds to an implicit
   * Euler step with modified step size (right hand side given). Thus, the
   * implementation of the theta scheme will use two Operator objects, one for
   * the explicit, one for the implicit part. Each of these will use its own
   * TimestepData to account for the modified step sizes (and different times
   * if the problem is not autonomous). Note that once the explicit part has
   * been computed, the left hand side actually constitutes a linear or
   * nonlinear system which has to be solved.
   *
   * <h3>Usage AnyData</h3>
   *
   * ThetaTimestepping uses AnyData for communicating vectors and time step
   * information. With outer or inner Operator objects. It does not use itself
   * the input vectors provided, but forwards them to the explicit and
   * implicit operators.
   *
   * <h4>Vector data</h4>
   *
   * The explicit Operator #op_explicit receives in its input in first place
   * the vector "Previous iterate", which is the solution value after the
   * previous timestep. It is followed by all vectors provided to
   * ThetaTimestepping::operator() as input argument. #op_explicit is supposed
   * to write its result into the first position of its output argument,
   * labeled "Result".
   *
   * The implicit Operator #op_implicit receives the result of #op_explicit in
   * its first input vector labeled "Previous time". It is followed by all
   * vectors provided to ThetaTimestepping::operator() as input argument. The
   * output of #op_implicit is directly written into the output argument given
   * to ThetaTimestepping.
   *
   * <h4>Scalar data</h4>
   *
   * Since the introduction of AnyData, ThetaTimestepping is able to
   * communicate the current time step information through AnyData as well.
   * Therefore, the AnyData objects handed as input to #op_explicit and
   * #op_implicit contain two entries of type `const double*` named "Time" and
   * "Timestep". Note that "Time" refers to the time at the beginning of the
   * current step for #op_explicit and at the end for #op_implicit,
   * respectively.
   *
   * <h3>Usage of ThetaTimestepping</h3>
   *
   * The use ThetaTimestepping is more complicated than for instance Newton,
   * since the inner operators will usually need to access the TimeStepData.
   * Thus, we have a circular dependency of information, and we include the
   * following example for its use. It can be found in
   * <tt>examples/doxygen/theta_timestepping.cc</tt>
   *
   * @dontinclude theta_timestepping.cc
   *
   * First, we define the two operators used by ThetaTimestepping and call
   * them <code>Implicit</code> and <code>Explicit</code>. They both share the
   * public interface of Operator, and additionally provide storage for the
   * matrices to be used and a pointer to TimestepData. Note that we do not
   * use a SmartPointer here, since the TimestepData will be destroyed before
   * the operator.
   *
   * @skip class Explicit @until End of declarations
   *
   * These operators will be implemented after the main program. But let us
   * look first at how they get used. First, let us define a matrix to be used
   * for our system and also an OutputOperator in order to write the data of
   * each timestep to a file.
   *
   * @skipline main @until out.initialize
   *
   * Now we create objects for the implicit and explicit parts of the steps as
   * well as the ThetaTimestepping itself. We initialize the timestepping with
   * the output operator in order to be able to see the output in every step.
   *
   * @until set_output
   *
   * The next step is providing the vectors to be used. <tt>value</tt> is
   * filled with the initial value and is also the vector where the solution
   * at each timestep will be. Because the interface of Operator has to be
   * able to handle several vectors, we need to store it in an AnyData object.
   * Since our problem has no additional parameters, the input AnyData object
   * remains empty.
   *
   * @until add
   *
   * Finally, we are ready to tell the solver, that we are starting at the
   * initial timestep and run it.
   *
   * @until }
   *
   * First the constructor, which simply copies the system matrix into the
   * member pointer for later use.
   *
   * @skip Explicit:: @until }
   *
   * Now we need to study the application of the implicit and explicit
   * operator. We assume that the pointer <code>matrix</code> points to the
   * matrix created in the main program (the constructor did this for us).
   * Here, we first get the time step size from the AnyData object that was
   * provided as input. Then, if we are in the first step or if the timestep
   * has changed, we fill the local matrix $m$, such that with the given
   * matrix $M$, it becomes \f[ m = I - \Delta t M. \f] After we have worked
   * off the notifications, we clear them, such that the matrix is only
   * generated when necessary.
   *
   * @skipline void @until clear
   *
   * Now we multiply the input vector with the new matrix and store on output.
   *
   * @until } The code for the implicit operator is almost the same, except
   * that we change the sign in front of the timestep and use the inverse of t
   * he matrix.
