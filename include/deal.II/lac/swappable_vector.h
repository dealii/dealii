/**
 * This class is a wrapper to the @p Vector class which allows to swap out the
 * data to a file and reload it later on. It handles the management of the
 * name of the file where the data is to be stored temporarily and removes the
 * file is necessary at the end of the lifetime of the vector.
 *
 * There are functions to swap the data to a file, and to reload it. There is
 * also a function @p alert that can be used to signal to an object of this
 * class that the data will be needed shortly, so the object can initiate that
 * the data be loaded already. While in non-multithreading mode, this function
 * has no effect since @p reload has to be called afterwards anyway. On the
 * other hand, in multithreading mode, the data is preloaded in the background
 * using a thread on its own, and may already be available at the time when @p
 * reload is called. If it is not available, @p reload waits until the
 * detached thread has loaded the data.
 *
 * @note Instantiations for this template are provided for <tt>@<float@> and
 * @<double@></tt>; others can be generated in application programs (see the
 * section on
 * @ref Instantiations
 * in the manual).
