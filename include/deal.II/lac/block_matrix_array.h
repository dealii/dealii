/**
 * Block matrix composed of different single matrices; these matrices may even
 * be of different types.
 *
 * Given a set of arbitrary matrices <i>A<sub>i</sub></i>, this class
 * implements a block matrix with block entries of the form <i>M<sub>jk</sub>
 * = s<sub>jk</sub>A<sub>i</sub></i>.  Each <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> may be used
 * several times with different prefix. The matrices are not copied into the
 * BlockMatrixArray object, but rather a PointerMatrix referencing each of
 * them will be stored along with factors and transposition flags.
 *
 * Non-zero entries are registered by the function enter(), zero entries are
 * not stored at all. Using enter() with the same location <tt>(i,j)</tt>
 * several times will add the corresponding matrices in matrix-vector
 * multiplications. These matrices will not be actually added, but the
 * multiplications with them will be summed up.
 *
 * @note This mechanism makes it impossible to access single entries of
 * BlockMatrixArray. In particular, (block) relaxation preconditioners based
 * on PreconditionRelaxation or PreconditionBlock <b>cannot</b> be used with
 * this class. If you need a preconditioner for a BlockMatrixArray object, use
 * BlockTrianglePrecondition.
 *
 * <h3>Requirements on MATRIX</h3>
 *
 * The template argument <tt>MATRIX</tt> is a class providing the matrix-
 * vector multiplication functions vmult(), Tvmult(), vmult_add() and
 * Tvmult_add() used in this class, but with arguments of type
 * Vector&lt;number&gt; instead of BlockVector&lt;number&gt;. Every matrix
 * which can be used by PointerMatrix is allowed, in particular SparseMatrix
 * is a possible entry type.
 *
 * <h3>Example program</h3> We document the relevant parts of
 * <tt>examples/doxygen/block_matrix_array.cc</tt>.
 *
 * @dontinclude block_matrix_array.cc
 *
 * Obviously, we have to include the header file containing the definition of
 * BlockMatrixArray:
 * @skipline block_matrix_array.h
 *
 * First, we set up some matrices to be entered into the blocks.
 * @skip main
 * @until C.fill
 *
 * The BlockMatrixArray needs a VectorMemory&lt;Vector&lt;number&gt; &gt;
 * object to allocate auxiliary vectors. <tt>number</tt> must equal the second
 * template argument of BlockMatrixArray and also the number type of the
 * BlockVector used later. We use the GrowingVectorMemory type, since it
 * remembers the vector and avoids reallocating.
 *
 * @line Growing
 *
 * Now, we are ready to build a <i>2x2</i> BlockMatrixArray.
 * @line Block First, we enter the matrix <tt>A</tt> multiplied by 2 in the
 * upper left block
 * @line enter Now -1 times <tt>B1</tt> in the upper right block.
 * @line enter We add the transpose of <tt>B2</tt> to the upper right block
 * and continue in a similar fashion. In the end, the block matrix structure
 * is printed into an LaTeX table.
 * @until latex
 *
 * Now, we set up vectors to be multiplied with this matrix and do a
 * multiplication.
 * @until vmult
 *
 * Finally, we solve a linear system with BlockMatrixArray, using no
 * preconditioning and the conjugate gradient method.
 * @until Error
 *
 * The remaining code of this sample program concerns preconditioning and is
 * described in the documentation of BlockTrianglePrecondition.
 *
 * @see
 * @ref GlossBlockLA "Block (linear algebra)"

/**
 * Inversion of a block-triangular matrix.
 *
 * In this block matrix, the inverses of the diagonal blocks are stored
 * together with the off-diagonal blocks of a block matrix. Then, forward or
 * backward insertion is performed block-wise. The diagonal blocks are NOT
 * inverted for this purpose!
 *
 * Like for all preconditioners, the preconditioning operation is performed by
 * the vmult() member function.
 *
 * @note While block indices may be duplicated (see BlockMatrixArray) to add
 * blocks, this has to be used with caution, since summing up the inverse of
 * two blocks does not yield the inverse of the sum. While the latter would be
 * desirable, we can only perform the first.
 *
 * The implementation may be a little clumsy, but it should be sufficient as
 * long as the block sizes are much larger than the number of blocks.
 *
 * <h3>Example</h3> Here, we document the second part of
 * <tt>examples/doxygen/block_matrix_array.cc</tt>. For the beginning of this
 * file, see BlockMatrixArray.
 *
 * In order to set up the preconditioner, we have to compute the inverses of
 * the diagonal blocks ourselves. Since we used FullMatrix objects, this is
 * fairly easy.
