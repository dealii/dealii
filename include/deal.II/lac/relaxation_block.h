/**
 * Base class for the implementation of overlapping, multiplicative Schwarz
 * relaxation methods and smoothers.
 *
 * This class uses the infrastructure provided by PreconditionBlockBase. It
 * adds functions to initialize with a block list and to do the relaxation
 * step. The actual relaxation method with the interface expected by
 * SolverRelaxation and MGSmootherRelaxation is in the derived classes.
 *
 * This class allows for more general relaxation methods than
 * PreconditionBlock, since the index sets may be arbitrary and overlapping,
 * while there only contiguous, disjoint sets of equal size are allowed. As a
 * drawback, this class cannot be used as a preconditioner, since its
 * implementation relies on a straight forward implementation of the Gauss-
 * Seidel process.
