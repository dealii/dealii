   * Base class for solver classes using the Trilinos solvers. Since solvers
   * in Trilinos are selected based on flags passed to a generic solver
   * object, basically all the actual solver calls happen in this class, and
   * derived classes simply set the right flags to select one solver or
   * another, or to set certain parameters for individual solvers. For a
   * general discussion on the Trilinos solver package AztecOO, we refer to
   * the <a
   * href="https://trilinos.org/docs/dev/packages/aztecoo/doc/html/index.html">AztecOO
   * user guide</a>.
   *
   * This solver class can also be used as a standalone class, where the
   * respective Krylov method is set via the flag <tt>solver_name</tt>. This
   * can be done at runtime (e.g., when parsing the solver from a
   * ParameterList) and is similar to the deal.II class SolverSelector.
