/**
 * Abstract base class for incomplete decompositions of a sparse matrix into
 * sparse factors. This class can't be used by itself, but only as the base
 * class of derived classes that actually implement particular decompositions
 * such as SparseILU or SparseMIC.
 *
 * The decomposition is stored as a sparse matrix which is why this class is
 * derived from the SparseMatrix. Since it is not a matrix in the usual sense
 * (the stored entries are not those of a matrix, but of the two factors of
 * the original matrix), the derivation is <tt>protected</tt> rather than
 * <tt>public</tt>.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Fill-in</h3>
 *
 * Sparse decompositions are frequently used with additional fill-in, i.e.,
 * the sparsity structure of the decomposition is denser than that of the
 * matrix to be decomposed. The initialize() function of this class allows
 * this fill-in via the AdditionalData object as long as all entries present
 * in the original matrix are present in the decomposition also, i.e. the
 * sparsity pattern of the decomposition is a superset of the sparsity pattern
 * in the original matrix.
 *
 * Such fill-in can be accomplished by various ways, one of which is the
 * copy-constructor of the SparsityPattern class that allows the addition of
 * side-diagonals to a given sparsity structure.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Unified use of preconditioners</h3>
 *
 * While objects of this class can not be used directly (this class is only a
 * base class for others implementing actual decompositions), derived classes
 * such as SparseILU and SparseMIC can be used in the usual form as
 * preconditioners. For example, this works:
 * @code
 * SparseILU<double> ilu;
 * ilu.initialize(matrix, SparseILU<double>::AdditionalData(...));
 *
 * somesolver.solve (A, x, f, ilu);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Through the AdditionalData object it is possible to specify additional
 * parameters of the LU decomposition.
 *
 * 1/ The matrix diagonal can be strengthened by adding
 * <code>strengthen_diagonal</code> times the sum of the absolute row entries of
 * each row to the respective diagonal entries. By default no strengthening is
 * performed.
 *
 * 2/ By default, each initialize() function call creates its own sparsity.
 * For that, it copies the sparsity of <code>matrix</code> and adds a specific
 * number of extra off diagonal entries specified by
 * <code>extra_off_diagonals</code>.
 *
 * 3/ By setting <code>use_previous_sparsity=true</code> the sparsity is not
 * recreated but the sparsity of the previous initialize() call is reused
 * (recycled). This might be useful when several linear problems on the same
 * sparsity need to solved, as for example several Newton iteration steps on
 * the same triangulation. The default is <code>false</code>.
 *
 * 4/ It is possible to give a user defined sparsity to
 * <code>use_this_sparsity</code>. Then, no sparsity is created but
 * <code>*use_this_sparsity</code> is used to store the decomposed matrix. For
 * restrictions on the sparsity see section `Fill-in' above).
 *
 *
 * <h3>Particular implementations</h3>
 *
 * It is enough to override the initialize() and vmult() methods to implement
 * particular LU decompositions, like the true LU, or the Cholesky
 * decomposition. Additionally, if that decomposition needs fine tuned
 * diagonal strengthening on a per row basis, it may override the
 * get_strengthen_diagonal() method.
 *
 * @author Stephen "Cheffo" Kolaroff, 2002, based on SparseILU implementation
 * by Wolfgang Bangerth; unified interface: Ralf Hartmann, 2003
