/**
 * This class provides an interface to the sparse direct solver UMFPACK (see
 * <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack">this link</a>).
 * UMFPACK is a set of routines for solving non-symmetric sparse linear
 * systems, Ax=b, using the Unsymmetric-pattern MultiFrontal method and direct
 * sparse LU factorization. Matrices may have symmetric or unsymmetrix
 * sparsity patterns, and may have unsymmetric entries. The use of this class
 * is explained in the
 * @ref step_22 "step-22"
 * and
 * @ref step_29 "step-29"
 * tutorial programs.
 *
 * This matrix class implements the usual interface of preconditioners, that
 * is a function initialize(const SparseMatrix<double>&matrix,const
 * AdditionalData) for initalizing and the whole set of vmult() functions
 * common to all matrices. Implemented here are only vmult() and vmult_add(),
 * which perform multiplication with the inverse matrix. Furthermore, this
 * class provides an older interface, consisting of the functions factorize()
 * and solve(). Both interfaces are interchangeable.
 *
 * @note This class exists if the <a
 * href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html">UMFPACK</a>
 * interface was not explicitly disabled during configuration.
 *
 * @note UMFPACK has its own license, independent of that of deal.II. If you
 * want to use the UMFPACK you have to accept that license. It is linked to
 * from the deal.II ReadMe file. UMFPACK is included courtesy of its author,
 * <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~davis/">Timothy A. Davis</a>.
 *
 *
 * <h4>Instantiations</h4>
 *
 * There are instantiations of this class for SparseMatrix<double>,
 * SparseMatrix<float>, SparseMatrixEZ<float>, SparseMatrixEZ<double>,
 * BlockSparseMatrix<double>, and BlockSparseMatrix<float>.
