 * Numerical vector of data.  For this class there are different types of

 * changes its size, or computes the norm of the vector in order to measure
 * its length in a suitable norm. The second type helps us to manipulate the
 * components of the vector. The third type defines the algebraic operations
 * for vectors, while the last type defines a few input and output functions.
 * As opposed to the array of the C++ standard library called @p vector (with
 * a lowercase "v"), this class implements an element of a vector space
 * suitable for numerical computations.

 * others can be generated in application programs (see the section on
