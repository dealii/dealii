    /**
     * This class implements a wrapper to use the Trilinos distributed vector
     * class Epetra_FEVector, the (parallel) partitioning of which
     * is governed by an Epetra_Map.
     * The Epetra_FEVector is precisely the kind of vector
     * we deal with all the time - we probably get it from some assembly
     * process, where also entries not locally owned might need to written and
     * hence need to be forwarded to the owner.
     *
     * The interface of this class is modeled after the existing Vector class in
     * deal.II. It has almost the same member functions, and is often
     * exchangeable. However, since Trilinos only supports a single scalar type
     * (double), it is not templated, and only works with that type.
     *
     * Note that Trilinos only guarantees that operations do what you expect
     * if the function @p GlobalAssemble has been called after vector assembly
     * in order to distribute the data. This is necessary since some processes
     * might have accumulated data of elements that are not owned by
     * themselves, but must be sent to the owning process. In order to avoid
     * using the wrong data, you need to call Vector::compress() before you
     * actually use the vectors.
     *
     * <h3>Parallel communication model</h3>
     *
     * The parallel functionality of Trilinos is built on top of the Message
     * Passing Interface (MPI). MPI's communication model is built on
     * collective communications: if one process wants something from another,
     * that other process has to be willing to accept this communication. A
     * process cannot query data from another process by calling a remote
     * function, without that other process expecting such a transaction. The
     * consequence is that most of the operations in the base class of this
     * class have to be called collectively. For example, if you want to
     * compute the l2 norm of a parallel vector, @em all processes across
     * which this vector is shared have to call the @p l2_norm function. If
     * you don't do this, but instead only call the @p l2_norm function on one
     * process, then the following happens: This one process will call one of
     * the collective MPI functions and wait for all the other processes to
     * join in on this. Since the other processes don't call this function,
     * you will either get a time-out on the first process, or, worse, by the
     * time the next a call to a Trilinos function generates an MPI message on
     * the other processes, you will get a cryptic message that only a subset
     * of processes attempted a communication. These bugs can be very hard to
     * figure out, unless you are well-acquainted with the communication model
     * of MPI, and know which functions may generate MPI messages.
     *
     * One particular case, where an MPI message may be generated unexpectedly
     * is discussed below.
     *
     *
     * <h3>Accessing individual elements of a vector</h3>
     *
     * Trilinos does of course allow read access to individual elements of a
     * vector, but in the distributed case only to elements that are stored
     * locally. We implement this through calls like <tt>d=vec(i)</tt>.
     * However, if you access an element outside the locally stored range, an
     * exception is generated.
     *
     * In contrast to read access, Trilinos (and the respective deal.II
     * wrapper classes) allow to write (or add) to individual elements of
     * vectors, even if they are stored on a different process. You can do
     * this by writing into or adding to elements using the syntax
     * <tt>vec(i)=d</tt> or <tt>vec(i)+=d</tt>, or similar operations. There
     * is one catch, however, that may lead to very confusing error messages:
     * Trilinos requires application programs to call the compress() function
     * when they switch from performing a set of operations that add to
     * elements, to performing a set of operations that write to elements. The
     * reasoning is that all processes might accumulate addition operations to
     * elements, even if multiple processes write to the same elements. By the
     * time we call compress() the next time, all these additions are
     * executed. However, if one process adds to an element, and another
     * overwrites to it, the order of execution would yield non-deterministic
     * behavior if we don't make sure that a synchronization with compress()
     * happens in between.
     *
     * In order to make sure these calls to compress() happen at the
     * appropriate time, the deal.II wrappers keep a state variable that store
     * which is the presently allowed operation: additions or writes. If it
     * encounters an operation of the opposite kind, it calls compress() and
     * flips the state. This can sometimes lead to very confusing behavior, in
     * code that may for example look like this:
     *
     * @code
     * TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector vector;
     * // do some write operations on the vector
     * for (size_type i=0; i<vector->size(); ++i)
     *   vector(i) = i;
     *
     *                   // do some additions to vector elements, but
     *                   // only for some elements
     *   for (size_type i=0; i<vector->size(); ++i)
     *     if (some_condition(i) == true)
     *       vector(i) += 1;
     *
     *                   // do another collective operation
     *   const double norm = vector->l2_norm();
     * @endcode
     *
     * This code can run into trouble: by the time we see the first addition
     * operation, we need to flush the overwrite buffers for the vector, and
     * the deal.II library will do so by calling compress(). However, it will
     * only do so for all processes that actually do an addition -- if the
     * condition is never true for one of the processes, then this one will
     * not get to the actual compress() call, whereas all the other ones do.
     * This gets us into trouble, since all the other processes hang in the
     * call to flush the write buffers, while the one other process advances
     * to the call to compute the l2 norm. At this time, you will get an error
     * that some operation was attempted by only a subset of processes. This
     * behavior may seem surprising, unless you know that write/addition
     * operations on single elements may trigger this behavior.
     *
     * The problem described here may be avoided by placing additional calls
     * to compress(), or making sure that all processes do the same type of
     * operations at the same time, for example by placing zero additions if
     * necessary.
     *
     *
     * <h3>Ghost elements of vectors</h3>
     *
     * Parallel vectors come in two kinds: without and with ghost elements.
     * Vectors without ghost elements uniquely partition the vector elements
     * between processors: each vector entry has exactly one processor that
     * owns it. For such vectors, you can read those elements that the
     * processor you are currently on owns, and you can write into any element
     * whether you own it or not: if you don't own it, the value written or
     * added to a vector element will be shipped to the processor that owns
     * this vector element the next time you call compress(), as described
     * above.
     *
     * What we call a 'ghosted' vector (see
     * @ref GlossGhostedVector "vectors with ghost elements"
     * ) is simply a view of the parallel vector where the element
     * distributions overlap. The 'ghosted' Trilinos vector in itself has no
     * idea of which entries are ghosted and which are locally owned. In fact,
     * a ghosted vector may not even store all of the elements a non- ghosted
     * vector would store on the current processor.  Consequently, for
     * Trilinos vectors, there is no notion of an 'owner' of vector elements
     * in the way we have it in the non-ghost case view.
     *
     * This explains why we do not allow writing into ghosted vectors on the
     * Trilinos side: Who would be responsible for taking care of the
     * duplicated entries, given that there is not such information as locally
     * owned indices? In other words, since a processor doesn't know which
     * other processors own an element, who would it send a value to if one
     * were to write to it? The only possibility would be to send this
     * information to <i>all</i> other processors, but that is clearly not
     * practical. Thus, we only allow reading from ghosted vectors, which
     * however we do very often.
     *
     * So how do you fill a ghosted vector if you can't write to it? This only
     * happens through the assignment with a non-ghosted vector. It can go
     * both ways (non-ghosted is assigned to a ghosted vector, and a ghosted
     * vector is assigned to a non-ghosted one; the latter one typically only
     * requires taking out the locally owned part as most often ghosted
     * vectors store a superset of elements of non-ghosted ones). In general,
     * you send data around with that operation and it all depends on the
     * different views of the two vectors. Trilinos also allows you to get
     * subvectors out of a big vector that way.
     *
     *
     * <h3>Thread safety of Trilinos vectors</h3>
     *
     * When writing into Trilinos vectors from several threads in shared
     * memory, several things must be kept in mind as there is no built-in
     * locks in this class to prevent data races. Simultaneous access to the
     * same vector entry at the same time results in data races and must be
     * explicitly avoided by the user. However, it is possible to access
     * <b>different</b> entries of the vector from several threads
     * simultaneously when only one MPI process is present or the vector has
     * been constructed with an additional index set for ghost entries in
     * write mode.
