/**
 * This is the base class for block versions of the sparsity pattern and
 * compressed sparsity pattern classes. It has not much functionality, but
 * only administrates an array of sparsity pattern objects and delegates work
 * to them. It has mostly the same interface as has the SparsityPattern,
 * CompressedSparsityPattern, and CompressedSetSparsityPattern classes, and
 * simply transforms calls to its member functions to calls to the respective
 * member functions of the member sparsity patterns.
 *
 * The largest difference between the SparsityPattern and
 * CompressedSparsityPattern classes and this class is that mostly, the
 * matrices have different properties and you will want to work on the blocks
 * making up the matrix rather than the whole matrix. You can access the
 * different blocks using the <tt>block(row,col)</tt> function.
 *
 * Attention: this object is not automatically notified if the size of one of
 * its subobjects' size is changed. After you initialize the sizes of the
 * subobjects, you will therefore have to call the <tt>collect_sizes()</tt>
 * function of this class! Note that, of course, all sub-matrices in a
 * (block-)row have to have the same number of rows, and that all sub-matrices
 * in a (block-)column have to have the same number of columns.
 *
 * You will in general not want to use this class, but one of the derived
 * classes.
 *
 * @todo Handle optimization of diagonal elements of the underlying
 * SparsityPattern correctly.
 *

 * @ref GlossBlockLA "Block (linear algebra)"
