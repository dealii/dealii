/**
 * This class acts as an intermediate form of the SparsityPattern class. From
 * the interface it mostly represents a SparsityPattern object that is kept
 * compressed at all times. However, since the final sparsity pattern is not
 * known while constructing it, keeping the pattern compressed at all times
 * can only be achieved at the expense of either increased memory or run time
 * consumption upon use. The main purpose of this class is to avoid some
 * memory bottlenecks, so we chose to implement it memory conservative, but
 * the chosen data format is too unsuited to be used for actual matrices. It
 * is therefore necessary to first copy the data of this object over to an
 * object of type SparsityPattern before using it in actual matrices.
 *
 * Another viewpoint is that this class does not need up front allocation of a
 * certain amount of memory, but grows as necessary.  An extensive description
 * of sparsity patterns can be found in the documentation of the
 * @ref Sparsity
 * module.
 *
 * This class is an example of the "dynamic" type of
 * @ref Sparsity.
 * It is discussed in the step-27 and
 * @ref step_22 "step-22"
 * tutorial programs.
 *
 * <h3>Interface</h3>
 *
 * Since this class is intended as an intermediate replacement of the
 * SparsityPattern class, it has mostly the same interface, with small changes
 * where necessary. In particular, the add() function, and the functions
 * inquiring properties of the sparsity pattern are the same.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Use this class as follows:
 * @code
 * CompressedSetSparsityPattern compressed_pattern (dof_handler.n_dofs());
 * DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern (dof_handler,
 *                                  compressed_pattern);
 * constraints.condense (compressed_pattern);
 *
 * SparsityPattern sp;
 * sp.copy_from (compressed_pattern);
 * @endcode
 *
 * See also step-11 and step-18 for usage patterns of the related
 * CompressedSparsityPattern class, and step-27 of the current class.
 *
 * <h3>Notes</h3>
 *
 * There are several, exchangeable variations of this class, see
 * @ref Sparsity,
 * section '"Dynamic" or "compressed" sparsity patterns' for more information.
 *
 * This class is a variation of the CompressedSparsityPattern class. Instead
 * of using sorted vectors together with a caching algorithm for storing the
 * column indices of nonzero entries, the std::set container is used. This
 * solution might not be the fastest in all situations, but seems to work much
 * better than the CompressedSparsityPattern in the context of hp-adaptivity
 * (see for example step-27), or generally when there are many nonzero entries
 * in each row of a matrix (see
 * @ref step_22 "step-22").
 * On the other hand, a benchmark where nonzero entries were randomly inserted
 * into the sparsity pattern revealed that this class is slower by a factor
 * 4-6 in this situation. Hence, currently the suggestion is to carefully
 * analyze which of the CompressedSparsityPattern classes works best in a
 * certain setting. An algorithm which performs equally well in all situations
 * still has to be found.
