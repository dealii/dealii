  /**
   * Implementation of a parallel matrix class based on PETSc
   * <tt>MatShell</tt> matrix-type. This base class implements only the
   * interface to the PETSc matrix object, while all the functionality is
   * contained in the matrix-vector multiplication which must be reimplemented
   * in derived classes.
   *
   * This interface is an addition to the dealii::MatrixFree class to realize
   * user-defined matrix-classes together with PETSc solvers and
   * functionalities. See also the documentation of dealii::MatrixFree class
   * and step-37 and step-48.
   *
   * Similar to other matrix classes in namespaces PETScWrappers and
   * PETScWrappers::MPI, the MatrixFree class provides the usual matrix-vector
   * multiplication <tt>vmult(VectorBase &dst, const VectorBase &src)</tt>
   * which is pure virtual and must be reimplemented in derived classes.
   * Besides the usual interface, this class has a matrix-vector
   * multiplication <tt>vmult(Vec  &dst, const Vec  &src)</tt> taking PETSc
   * Vec objects, which will be called by <tt>matrix_free_mult(Mat A, Vec src,
   * Vec dst)</tt> registered as matrix-vector multiplication of this PETSc
   * matrix object. The default implementation of the vmult function in the
   * base class translates the given PETSc <tt>Vec*</tt> vectors into a
   * deal.II vector, calls the usual vmult function with the usual interface
   * and converts the result back to PETSc <tt>Vec*</tt>. This could be made
   * much more efficient in derived classes without allocating new memory.
