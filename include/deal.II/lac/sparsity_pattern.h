  /**
   * An iterator class for walking over the elements of a sparsity pattern.
   *
   * The typical use for these iterators is to iterate over the elements of a
   * sparsity pattern (or, since they also serve as the basis for iterating
   * over the elements of an associated matrix, over the elements of a sparse
   * matrix), or over the elements of individual rows. There is no guarantee
   * that the elements of a row are actually traversed in an order in which
   * column numbers monotonically increase. See the documentation of the
   * SparsityPattern class for more information.
   *
   * @note This class operates directly on the internal data structures of the
   * SparsityPatternBase class. As a consequence, some operations are cheap and
   * some are not. In particular, it is cheap to access the column index of
   * the sparsity pattern entry pointed to. On the other hand, it is expensive
   * to access the row index (this requires $O(\log(N))$ operations for a
   * matrix with $N$ row). As a consequence, when you design algorithms that
   * use these iterators, it is common practice to not loop over <i>all</i>
   * elements of a sparsity pattern at once, but to have an outer loop over
   * all rows and within this loop iterate over the elements of this row. This
   * way, you only ever need to dereference the iterator to obtain the column
   * indices whereas the (expensive) lookup of the row index can be avoided by
   * using the loop index instead.

/**
 * This class stores a sparsity pattern in
 * the <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix">compressed row storage
 * (CSR)</a> format to store data, and is used as the basis for the
 * SparseMatrix class.
 *
 * The elements of a SparsityPattern, corresponding to the places where
 * SparseMatrix objects can store nonzero entries, are stored row-by-row.
 * Within each row, elements are generally stored left-to-right in increasing
 * column index order; the exception to this rule is that if the matrix is
 * square (n_rows() == n_columns()), then the diagonal entry is stored as the
 * first element in each row to make operations like applying a Jacobi or SSOR
 * preconditioner faster. As a consequence, if you traverse the elements of a
 * row of a SparsityPattern with the help of iterators into this object (using
 * SparsityPattern::begin and SparsityPattern::end) you will find that the
 * elements are not sorted by column index within each row whenever the matrix
 * is square (the first item will be the diagonal, followed by the other
 * entries sorted by column index).
 *
 * While this class forms the basis upon which SparseMatrix objects base
 * their storage format, and thus plays a central role in setting up linear
 * systems, it is rarely set up directly due to the way it stores its
 * information. Rather, one typically goes through an intermediate format
 * first, see for example the step-2 tutorial program as well as the
 * documentation module
 * @ref Sparsity.
 *
 * You can iterate over entries in the pattern using begin(), end(),
 * begin(row), and end(row). These functions return an iterator of type
 * SparsityPatternIterators::Iterator. When dereferencing an iterator @p it,
 * you have access to the member functions in
 * SparsityPatternIterators::Accessor, like <tt>it->column()</tt> and
 * <tt>it->row()</tt>.

  /**
   * This function can be used as a replacement for reinit(), subsequent calls

   *
   * The first two parameters determine the size of the matrix. For the two
   * last ones, note that a sparse matrix can be described by a sequence of
   * rows, each of which is represented by a sequence of pairs of column
   * indices and values. In the present context, the begin() and end()
   * parameters designate iterators (of forward iterator type) into a
   * container, one representing one row. The distance between begin() and
   * end() should therefore be equal to n_rows(). These iterators may be
   * iterators of <tt>std::vector</tt>, <tt>std::list</tt>, pointers into a
   * C-style array, or any other iterator satisfying the requirements of a
   * forward iterator. The objects pointed to by these iterators (i.e. what we
   * get after applying <tt>operator*</tt> or <tt>operator-></tt> to one of
   * these iterators) must be a container itself that provides functions
   * <tt>begin</tt> and <tt>end</tt> designating a range of iterators that
   * describe the contents of one line. Dereferencing these inner iterators
   * must either yield a pair of an unsigned integer as column index and a
   * value of arbitrary type (such a type would be used if we wanted to
   * describe a sparse matrix with one such object), or simply an unsigned
   * integer (of we only wanted to describe a sparsity pattern). The function
   * is able to determine itself whether an unsigned integer or a pair is what
   * we get after dereferencing the inner iterators, through some template
   * magic.
   *
   * While the order of the outer iterators denotes the different rows of the
   * matrix, the order of the inner iterator denoting the columns does not
   * matter, as they are sorted internal to this function anyway.
   *
   * Since that all sounds very complicated, consider the following example
   * code, which may be used to fill a sparsity pattern:
   * @code
   * std::vector<std::vector<unsigned int> > column_indices (n_rows);
   * for (unsigned int row=0; row<n_rows; ++row)
   *         // generate necessary columns in this row
   *   fill_row (column_indices[row]);
   *
   * sparsity.copy_from (n_rows, n_cols,
   *                     column_indices.begin(),
   *                     column_indices.end());
   * @endcode
   *
   * Note that this example works since the iterators dereferenced yield
   * containers with functions <tt>begin</tt> and <tt>end</tt> (namely
   * <tt>std::vector</tt>s), and the inner iterators dereferenced yield
   * unsigned integers as column indices. Note that we could have replaced
   * each of the two <tt>std::vector</tt> occurrences by <tt>std::list</tt>,
   * and the inner one by <tt>std::set</tt> as well.
   *
   * Another example would be as follows, where we initialize a whole matrix,
   * not only a sparsity pattern:
   * @code
   * std::vector<std::map<unsigned int,double> > entries (n_rows);
   * for (unsigned int row=0; row<n_rows; ++row)
   *         // generate necessary pairs of columns
   *         // and corresponding values in this row
   *   fill_row (entries[row]);
   *
   * sparsity.copy_from (n_rows, n_cols,
   *                     column_indices.begin(),
   *                     column_indices.end());
   * matrix.reinit (sparsity);
   * matrix.copy_from (column_indices.begin(),
   *                   column_indices.end());
   * @endcode
   *
   * This example works because dereferencing iterators of the inner type
   * yields a pair of unsigned integers and a value, the first of which we
   * take as column index. As previously, the outer <tt>std::vector</tt> could
   * be replaced by <tt>std::list</tt>, and the inner <tt>std::map<unsigned
   * int,double></tt> could be replaced by <tt>std::vector<std::pair<unsigned
   * int,double> ></tt>, or a list or set of such pairs, as they all return
   * iterators that point to such pairs.
