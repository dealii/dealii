   * An implementation of block vectors based on the vector class implemented
   * in TrilinosWrappers. While the base class provides for most of the
   * interface, this class handles the actual allocation of vectors and
   * provides functions that are specific to the underlying vector type.
   *
   * In contrast to the class MPI::BlockVector, this class is based on a
   * localized version of the vectors, which means that the whole vector is
   * stored on each processor. Note that matrix vector products with this
   * block vector class do only work in case the program is run on only one
   * processor, since the Trilinos matrices are inherently parallel.
