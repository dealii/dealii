/**
 * View of a numerical vector of data. This class provides an interface
 * compatible with the Vector<double> class (from which it is inherited), that
 * allows fast access to locations of memory already allocated with arrays of
 * type Number.
 *
 * This is in the same style of the vector view in the Trilinos library.
 *
 * You should consider using the VectorView object ONLY when ALL of the
 * following requirements are met:
 *
 * 1. Your application requires a Vector<Number> object.
 *
 * 2. All you have at your disposal is a Number* pointer.
 *
 * 3. You are ABSOLUTELY SURE that the above pointer points to a valid area of
 * memory of the correct size.
 *
 * 4. You really believe that making a copy of that memory would be too
 * expensive.
 *
 * 5. You really know what you are doing.
 *
 * Notice that NO CHECKS are performed on the actual memory, and if you try to
 * access illegal areas of memory, your computer will suffer from it. Once
 * again, use this class ONLY if you know exactly what you are doing.
 *
 * Two constructors are provided. One for read-write access, and one for read
 * only access, and you are allowed to use this class on objects of type const
 * Number*. However you should be aware of the fact that the constness of the
 * array pointed to is ignored, which means that you should only use the const
 * constructor when the actual object you are constructing is itself a
 * constant object. As a corollary, you will be allowed to call even functions
 * of the base class that change data of the array; this being a violation of
 * the C++ type model, you should make sure that this only happens if it is
 * really valid and, in general, if you know what you are doing.
 *
 * Since this class does not own the memory that you are accessing, you have
 * to make sure that the lifetime of the section of memory you are viewing is
 * longer than this object. No attempt is made to ensure that this is the
 * case.
 *
 * An example usage of this class is the following:
 *
 * @code
 * // Create an array of length 5;
 * double * array = new double[5];
 * // Now create a view of the above array that is compatible with the
 * // Vector<double> class
 * VectorView<double> view(5, array);
 *
 * view(1) = 4;
 *
 * // The following line should output 4.
 * cout << array[1] << endl;
 *
 * // If debug mode is on, then the following triggers an execption:
 * view(6) = 4;
 *
 * // But notice that no checks are performed, so this is legal but WILL
 * // NOT work
 * VectorView<double> wrong_view(10, array);
 *
 * // Now no assert will be thrown if you type wrong_view(6), but most
 * // likely a seg fault will occur.
 * view(6) = 4;
 *
 * // Notice that this construction is legal. It will create a copy of
 * // the array.
 * const Vector<double> const_copy(view);
 *
 * // Now this is the correct way to instantiate a constant view of the
 * // above vector:
 * const VectorView<double> correct_const_copy_view(5, const_copy.begin());
 *
 * // While this will compile, BUT WILL NOT COMPLAIN if you try to write
 * // on it!
 * VectorView<double> wrong_const_copy_view(5, const_copy.begin());
 *
 * // Now writing to elements of wrong_const_copy_view is allowed, and
 * // will change the same memory as the const_copy object.
 * wrong_const_copy_view(1) = 5;
 *
 * if(copy_view(1) == wrong_const_copy_view(1)) cout << "Tautology";
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @note Instantiations for this template are provided for <tt>@<float@>,
 * @<double@>, @<long double@>, @<std::complex@<float@>@>,
 * @<std::complex@<double@>@>, @<std::complex@<long double@>@></tt>; others
 * can be generated in application programs (see the section on
 * @ref Instantiations
 * in the manual).

   *
   * Undefined behavior will occur if you construct it as a non const object
   * or attempt to write on it.
   */

   * This desctructor will only reset the internal sizes and the internal
   * pointers, but it will NOT clear the memory.
   */
  ~VectorView();

  /**
   * The reinit function of this object has a behavior which is different from
   * the one of the base class. VectorView does not handle memory, and you
   * should not attempt to resize the memory that is pointed to by this object
   * using the reinit function. You can, however, resize the view that you
   * have of the original object. Notice that it is your own responsibility to
   * ensure that the memory you are pointing to is big enough.
   *
   * Similarly to what happens in the base class, if fast is false, then the
   * entire content of the vector is set to 0, otherwise the content of the
   * memory is left unchanged.
   *
   * Notice that the following snippet of code may not produce what you
   * expect:
   *
   * @code
   * // Create a vector of length 1.
   * Vector<double> long_vector(1);
   *
   * // Make a view of it
   * VectorView<double> view_of_long_vector(1, long_vector.begin());
   *
   * // Resize the original vector to a bigger size
   * long_vector.reinit(100);
   *
   * // And the view, leaving the memory untouched
   * view_of_long_vector.reinit(100, true);
   * @endcode
   *
   * In the above case, the Vector<double>::reinit method is called, and a NEW
   * area of memory is reserved, possibly not starting at the same place as
   * before. Hoever, the VectorView<double> object keeps pointing to the same
   * old area. After the two reinits, any call to view_of_long_vector(i), with
   * i>0 might cause an attempt to access invalid areas of memory, or might
   * function properly, depending on whether or not the system was able to
   * allocate some memory consecutively after the original allocation.
   *
   * In any case, you should not rely on this behavior, and you should only
   * call this reinit function if you really know what you are doing.
