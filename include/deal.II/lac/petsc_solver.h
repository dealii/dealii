  /**
   * Base class for solver classes using the PETSc solvers. Since solvers in
   * PETSc are selected based on flags passed to a generic solver object,
   * basically all the actual solver calls happen in this class, and derived
   * classes simply set the right flags to select one solver or another, or to
   * set certain parameters for individual solvers.
   *
   * Optionally, the user can create a solver derived from the SolverBase
   * class and can set the default arguments necessary to solve the linear
   * system of equations with SolverControl. These default options can be
   * overridden by specifying command line arguments of the form @p -ksp_*.
   * For example, @p -ksp_monitor_true_residual prints out true residual norm
   * (unpreconditioned) at each iteration and @p -ksp_view provides
   * information about the linear solver and the preconditioner used in the
   * current context. The type of the solver can also be changed during
   * runtime by specifying @p -ksp_type {richardson, cg, gmres, fgmres, ..} to
   * dynamically test the optimal solver along with a suitable preconditioner
   * set using @p -pc_type {jacobi, bjacobi, ilu, lu, ..}. There are several
   * other command line options available to modify the behavior of the PETSc
   * linear solver and can be obtained from the <a
   * href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc">documentation and manual pages</a>.
   *
   * @note Command line options relative to convergence tolerances are ignored
   * when the solver is instantiated with a SolverControl.
   *
   * @note Repeated calls to solve() on a solver object with a Preconditioner
   * must be used with care. The preconditioner is initialized in the first
   * call to solve() and subsequent calls reuse the solver and preconditioner
   * object. This is done for performance reasons. The solver and
   * preconditioner can be reset by calling reset() or by using the command
   * line option "-ksp_reuse_preconditioner false".
