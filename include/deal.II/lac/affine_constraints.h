/**
 * This class implements dealing with linear (possibly inhomogeneous)
 * constraints on degrees of freedom. The concept and origin of such
 * constraints is extensively described in the
 * @ref constraints
 * module. The class is meant to deal with a limited number of constraints
 * relative to the total number of degrees of freedom, for example a few per
 * cent up to maybe 30 per cent; and with a linear combination of <i>M</i>
 * other degrees of freedom where <i>M</i> is also relatively small (no larger
 * than at most around the average number of entries per row of a linear
 * system). It is <em>not</em> meant to describe full rank linear systems.
 *
 * The algorithms used in the implementation of this class are described in
 * some detail in the
 * @ref hp_paper "hp-paper".
 * There is also a significant amount of documentation on how to use this
 * class in the
 * @ref constraints
 * module.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Description of constraints</h3>
 *
 * Each "line" in objects of this class corresponds to one constrained degree
 * of freedom, with the number of the line being <i>i</i>, entered by using
 * add_line() or add_lines(). The entries in this line are pairs of the form
 * (<i>j</i>,<i>a<sub>ij</sub></i>), which are added by add_entry() or
 * add_entries(). The organization is essentially a SparsityPattern, but with
 * only a few lines containing nonzero elements, and  therefore no data wasted
 * on the others. For each line, which has been added by the mechanism above,
 * an elimination of the constrained degree of freedom of the form
 * @f[
 *  x_i = \sum_j a_{ij} x_j + b_i
 * @f]
 * is performed, where <i>b<sub>i</sub></i> is optional and set by
 * set_inhomogeneity(). Thus, if a constraint is formulated for instance as a
 * zero mean value of several degrees of freedom, one of the degrees has to be
 * chosen to be eliminated.
 *
 * Note that the constraints are linear in the <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>, and that
 * there might be a constant (non-homogeneous) term in the constraint. This is
 * exactly the form we need for hanging node constraints, where we need to
 * constrain one degree of freedom in terms of others. There are other
 * conditions of this form possible, for example for implementing mean value
 * conditions as is done in the step-11 tutorial program. The name of the
 * class stems from the fact that these constraints can be represented in
 * matrix form as <b>X</b> <i>x</i> = <i>b</i>, and this object then describes
 * the matrix <b>X</b> and the vector <i>b</i>. The most frequent way to
 * create/fill objects of this type is using the
 * DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints() function. The use of these
 * objects is first explained in step-6.
 *
 * Objects of the present type are organized in lines (rows), but only those
 * lines are stored where constraints are present. New constraints are added
 * by adding new lines using the add_line() function, and then populating it
 * using the add_entry() function to a given line, or add_entries() to add
 * more than one entry at a time. The right hand side element, if nonzero, can
 * be set using the set_inhomogeneity() function. After all constraints have
 * been added, you need to call close(), which compresses the storage format
 * and sorts the entries.
 *
 * @note Many of the algorithms this class implements are discussed in the
 * @ref hp_paper.
 * The algorithms are also related to those shown in <i>M. S. Shephard: Linear
 * multipoint constraints applied via transformation as part of a direct
 * stiffness assembly process. Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engrg., vol. 20 (1984),
 * pp. 2107-2112.</i>, with the difference that the algorithms shown there
 * completely eliminated constrained degrees of freedom, whereas we usually
 * keep them as part of the linear system.

   * local_dof_indices and distributes them to the global matrix. In other
   * words, this function implements a
   * [scatter
   * operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gather-scatter_(vector_addressing)).
   * In most
   * cases, these local contributions will be the result of an integration
   * over a cell or face of a cell. However, as long as @p local_matrix and @p
   * local_dof_indices have the same number of elements, this function is
   * happy with whatever it is given.
   *
   * In contrast to the similar function in the DoFAccessor class, this
   * function also takes care of constraints, i.e. if one of the elements of
   * @p local_dof_indices belongs to a constrained node, then rather than
   * writing the corresponding element of @p local_matrix into @p
   * global_matrix, the element is distributed to the entries in the global
   * matrix to which this particular degree of freedom is constrained.
   *
   * With this scheme, we never write into rows or columns of constrained
   * degrees of freedom. In order to make sure that the resulting matrix can
   * still be inverted, we need to do something with the diagonal elements
   * corresponding to constrained nodes. Thus, if a degree of freedom in @p
   * local_dof_indices is constrained, we distribute the corresponding entries
   * in the matrix, but also add the absolute value of the diagonal entry of
   * the local matrix to the corresponding entry in the global matrix.
   * Assuming the discretized operator is positive definite, this guarantees
   * that the diagonal entry is always non-zero, positive, and of the same
   * order of magnitude as the other entries of the matrix. On the other hand,
   * when solving a source problem $Au=f$ the exact value of the diagonal
   * element is not important, since the value of the respective degree of
   * freedom will be overwritten by the distribute() call later on anyway.
   *
   * @note The procedure described above adds an unforeseeable number of
   * artificial eigenvalues to the spectrum of the matrix. Therefore, it is
   * recommended to use the equivalent function with two local index vectors
   * in such a case.
   *
   * By using this function to distribute local contributions to the global
   * object, one saves the call to the condense function after the vectors and
   * matrices are fully assembled.
   *
   * @note This function in itself is thread-safe, i.e., it works properly
   * also when several threads call it simultaneously. However, the function
   * call is only thread-safe if the underlying global matrix allows for
   * simultaneous access and the access is not to rows with the same global
   * index at the same time. This needs to be made sure from the caller's
   * site. There is no locking mechanism inside this method to prevent data
   * races.

   * Do a similar operation as the distribute_local_to_global() function that
   * distributes writing entries into a matrix for constrained degrees of
   * freedom, except that here we don't write into a matrix but only allocate
   * sparsity pattern entries.
   *
   * As explained in the
   * @ref hp_paper "hp-paper"
   * and in step-27, first allocating a sparsity pattern and later coming back
   * and allocating additional entries for those matrix entries that will be
   * written to due to the elimination of constrained degrees of freedom
   * (using AffineConstraints::condense() ), can be a very expensive procedure.
   * It is cheaper to allocate these entries right away without having to do a
   * second pass over the sparsity pattern object. This function does exactly
   * that.
   *
   * Because the function only allocates entries in a sparsity pattern, all it
   * needs to know are the degrees of freedom that couple to each other.
   * Unlike the previous function, no actual values are written, so the second
   * input argument is not necessary here.
   *
   * The third argument to this function, keep_constrained_entries determines
   * whether the function shall allocate entries in the sparsity pattern at
   * all for entries that will later be set to zero upon condensation of the
   * matrix. These entries are necessary if the matrix is built unconstrained,
   * and only later condensed. They are not necessary if the matrix is built
   * using the distribute_local_to_global() function of this class which
   * distributes entries right away when copying a local matrix into a global
   * object. The default of this argument is true, meaning to allocate the few
   * entries that may later be set to zero.
   *
   * By default, the function adds entries for all pairs of indices given in
   * the first argument to the sparsity pattern (unless
   * keep_constrained_entries is false). However, sometimes one would like to
   * only add a subset of all of these pairs. In that case, the last argument
   * can be used which specifies a boolean mask which of the pairs of indices
   * should be considered. If the mask is false for a pair of indices, then no
   * entry will be added to the sparsity pattern for this pair, irrespective
   * of whether one or both of the indices correspond to constrained degrees
   * of freedom.
   *
   * This function is not typically called from user code, but is used in the
   * DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern() function when passed an
   * AffineConstraints object.
   *
   * @note This function in itself is thread-safe, i.e., it works properly
   * also when several threads call it simultaneously. However, the function
   * call is only thread-safe if the underlying global sparsity pattern allows
   * for simultaneous access and the access is not to rows with the same
   * global index at the same time. This needs to be made sure from the

   * actually be shorter than the index of the DoF we check for.
   *
   * This field exists since when adding a new constraint line we have to
   * figure out whether it already exists. Previously, we would simply walk
   * the unsorted list of constraint lines until we either hit the end or
   * found it. This algorithm is O(N) if N is the number of constraints, which
   * makes it O(N^2) when inserting all constraints. For large problems with
   * many constraints, this could easily take 5-10 per cent of the total run
   * time. With this field, we can save this time since we find any constraint
   * in O(1) time or get to know that it a certain degree of freedom is not
   * constrained.
   *
   * To make things worse, traversing the list of existing constraints
   * requires reads from many different places in memory. Thus, in large 3d
   * applications, the add_line() function showed up very prominently in the
   * overall compute time, mainly because it generated a lot of cache misses.
   * This should also be fixed by using the O(1) algorithm to access the
   * fields of this array.
   *
   * The field is useful in a number of other contexts as well, e.g. when one
   * needs random access to the constraints as in all the functions that apply
   * constraints on the fly while add cell contributions into vectors and
   * matrices.
