  /**
   * This class implements an algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner based
   * on the Trilinos ML implementation, which is a black-box preconditioner
   * that works well for many PDE-based linear problems.  What this class does
   * is twofold.  When the initialize() function is invoked, a ML
   * preconditioner object is created based on the matrix that we want the
   * preconditioner to be based on. A call of the respective
   * <code>vmult</code> function does call the respective operation in the
   * Trilinos package, where it is called <code>ApplyInverse</code>. Use of
   * this class is explained in the step-31 tutorial program.
   *
   * Since the Trilinos objects we want to use are heavily dependent on Epetra
   * objects, we recommend using this class in conjunction with Trilinos
   * (Epetra) sparse matrices and vectors. There is support for use with
   * matrices of the deal.II::SparseMatrix class and corresponding vectors,
   * too, but this requires generating a copy of the matrix, which is slower
   * and takes (much) more memory. When doing such a copy operation, we can
   * still profit from the fact that some of the entries in the preconditioner
   * matrix are zero and hence can be neglected.
   *
   * The implementation is able to distinguish between matrices from elliptic
   * problems and convection dominated problems. We use the standard options
   * provided by Trilinos ML for elliptic problems, except that we use a
   * Chebyshev smoother instead of a symmetric Gauss-Seidel smoother.  For
   * most elliptic problems, Chebyshev provides a better damping of high
   * frequencies (in the algebraic sense) than Gauss-Seidel (SSOR), and is
   * faster (Chebyshev requires only some matrix-vector products, whereas SSOR
   * requires substitutions which are more expensive). Moreover, Chebyshev is
   * perfectly parallel in the sense that it does not degenerate when used on
   * many processors. SSOR, on the other hand, gets more Jacobi-like on many
   * processors.
   *
   * For proper functionality of this class we recommend using Trilinos v9.0
   * and higher. Older versions may have problems with generating the coarse-
   * matrix structure when using matrices with many nonzero entries per row
   * (i.e., matrices stemming from higher order finite element
   * discretizations).
