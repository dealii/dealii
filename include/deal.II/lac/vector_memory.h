/**
 * Memory management base class for vectors. This is an abstract base class
 * used, among other places, by all iterative methods to allocate space for
 * auxiliary vectors.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is as follows: in iterative solvers and other
 * places, one needs to allocate temporary storage for vectors, for example
 * for auxiliary vectors. One could allocate and release them anew every time,
 * but this may be expensive in some situations if it has to happen very
 * frequently. A common case for this is when an iterative method is used to
 * invert a matrix in each iteration an outer solver, such as when inverting a
 * matrix block for a Schur complement solver.
 *
 * In such situations, allocating and deallocating vectors anew in each call
 * to the inner solver is expensive and leads to memory fragmentation. The
 * present class allows to avoid this by offering an interface that other
 * classes can use to allocate and deallocate vectors. Different derived
 * classes then implement different strategies to provide temporary storage
 * vectors to using classes.
 *
 * For example, the PrimitiveVectorMemory class simply allocates and
 * deallocated vectors each time it is asked for a vector. It is an
 * appropriate implementation to use for iterative solvers that are called
 * only once, or very infrequently.
 *
 * On the other hand, the GrowingVectorMemory class never returns memory space
 * to the operating system memory management subsystem during its lifetime; it
 * only marks them as unused and allows them to be reused next time a vector
 * is requested.
 *
 * Yet other classes, when implemented, could provide even other strategies
 * for memory management.

/**
 * A pool based memory management class. See the documentation of the base

 *
 * Each time a vector is requested from this class, it checks if it has one
 * available and returns its address, or allocates a new one on the heap. If a
 * vector is returned, through the free() member function, it doesn't return
 * it to the operating system memory subsystem, but keeps it around unused for
 * later use if alloc() is called again, or until the object is destroyed. The
 * class therefore avoid the overhead of repeatedly allocating memory on the
 * heap if temporary vectors are required and released frequently; on the
 * other hand, it doesn't release once-allocated memory at the earliest
 * possible time and may therefore lead to an increased overall memory
 * consumption.
 *
 * All GrowingVectorMemory objects of the same vector type use the same memory
 * Pool. Therefore, functions can create such a VectorMemory object whenever
 * needed without performance penalty. A drawback of this policy might be that
 * vectors once allocated are only released at the end of the program run.
 * Nevertheless, the since they are reused, this should be of no concern.
 * Additionally, the destructor of the Pool warns about memory leaks.
