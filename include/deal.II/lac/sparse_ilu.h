/**
 * This class computes an Incomplete LU (ILU) decomposition of a sparse
 * matrix, using either the same sparsity pattern or a different one. By
 * incomplete we mean that unlike the exact decomposition, the incomplete one
 * is also computed using sparse factors, and entries in the decomposition
 * that do not fit into the given sparsity structure are discarded.
 *
 * The algorithm used by this class is essentially a copy of the algorithm
 * given in the book Y. Saad: "Iterative methods for sparse linear systems",
 * second edition, in section 10.3.2.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage and state management</h3>
 *
 * Refer to SparseLUDecomposition documentation for suggested usage and state
 * management. This class is used in the
 * step-22
 * tutorial program.
 *
 * @note Instantiations for this template are provided for <tt>@<float@> and
 * @<double@></tt>; others can be generated in application programs (see the
 * section on
 * @ref Instantiations
 * in the manual).
