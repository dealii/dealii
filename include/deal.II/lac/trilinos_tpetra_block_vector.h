     * An implementation of block vectors based on the vector class
     * implemented in LinearAlgebra::TpetraWrappers.
     * While the base class provides for most of the interface, this class
     * handles the actual allocation of vectors and provides functions that
     * are specific to the underlying vector type.
     *
     * The model of distribution of data is such that each of the blocks is
     * distributed across all MPI processes named in the MPI communicator.
     * I.e. we don't just distribute the whole vector, but each component. In
     * the constructors and reinit() functions, one therefore not only has to
     * specify the sizes of the individual blocks, but also the number of
     * elements of each of these blocks to be stored on the local process.
