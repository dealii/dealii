    /**
     * Implementation of a parallel vector class based on PETSC and using MPI
     * communication to synchronise distributed operations. All the
     * functionality is actually in the base class, except for the calls to
     * generate a parallel vector. This is possible since PETSc only works on
     * an abstract vector type and internally distributes to functions that do
     * the actual work depending on the actual vector type (much like using
     * virtual functions). Only the functions creating a vector of specific
     * type differ, and are implemented in this particular class.
     *
     *
     * <h3>Parallel communication model</h3>
     *
     * The parallel functionality of PETSc is built on top of the Message
     * Passing Interface (MPI). MPI's communication model is built on
     * collective communications: if one process wants something from another,
     * that other process has to be willing to accept this communication. A
     * process cannot query data from another process by calling a remote
     * function, without that other process expecting such a transaction. The
     * consequence is that most of the operations in the base class of this
     * class have to be called collectively. For example, if you want to
     * compute the l2 norm of a parallel vector, @em all processes across
     * which this vector is shared have to call the @p l2_norm function. If
     * you don't do this, but instead only call the @p l2_norm function on one
     * process, then the following happens: This one process will call one of
     * the collective MPI functions and wait for all the other processes to
     * join in on this. Since the other processes don't call this function,
     * you will either get a time-out on the first process, or, worse, by the
     * time the next a callto a PETSc function generates an MPI message on the
     * other processes, you will get a cryptic message that only a subset of
     * processes attempted a communication. These bugs can be very hard to
     * figure out, unless you are well-acquainted with the communication model
     * of MPI, and know which functions may generate MPI messages.
     *
     * One particular case, where an MPI message may be generated unexpectedly
     * is discussed below.
     *
     *
     * <h3>Accessing individual elements of a vector</h3>
     *
     * PETSc does allow read access to individual elements of a vector, but in
     * the distributed case only to elements that are stored locally. We
     * implement this through calls like <tt>d=vec(i)</tt>. However, if you
     * access an element outside the locally stored range, an exception is
     * generated.
     *
     * In contrast to read access, PETSc (and the respective deal.II wrapper
     * classes) allow to write (or add) to individual elements of vectors,
     * even if they are stored on a different process. You can do this
     * writing, for example, <tt>vec(i)=d</tt> or <tt>vec(i)+=d</tt>, or
     * similar operations. There is one catch, however, that may lead to very
     * confusing error messages: PETSc requires application programs to call
     * the compress() function when they switch from adding, to elements to
     * writing to elements. The reasoning is that all processes might
     * accumulate addition operations to elements, even if multiple processes
     * write to the same elements. By the time we call compress() the next
     * time, all these additions are executed. However, if one process adds to
     * an element, and another overwrites to it, the order of execution would
     * yield non-deterministic behavior if we don't make sure that a
     * synchronisation with compress() happens in between.
     *
     * In order to make sure these calls to compress() happen at the
     * appropriate time, the deal.II wrappers keep a state variable that store
     * which is the presently allowed operation: additions or writes. If it
     * encounters an operation of the opposite kind, it calls compress() and
     * flips the state. This can sometimes lead to very confusing behavior, in
     * code that may for example look like this:
     * @code
     *   PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector vector;
     *   ...
     *                   // do some write operations on the vector
     *   for (unsigned int i=0; i<vector.size(); ++i)
     *     vector(i) = i;
     *
     *                   // do some additions to vector elements, but
     *                   // only for some elements
     *   for (unsigned int i=0; i<vector.size(); ++i)
     *     if (some_condition(i) == true)
     *       vector(i) += 1;
     *
     *                   // do another collective operation
     *   const double norm = vector.l2_norm();
     * @endcode
     *
     * This code can run into trouble: by the time we see the first addition
     * operation, we need to flush the overwrite buffers for the vector, and
     * the deal.II library will do so by calling compress(). However, it will
     * only do so for all processes that actually do an addition -- if the
     * condition is never true for one of the processes, then this one will
     * not get to the actual compress() call, whereas all the other ones do.
     * This gets us into trouble, since all the other processes hang in the
     * call to flush the write buffers, while the one other process advances
     * to the call to compute the l2 norm. At this time, you will get an error
     * that some operation was attempted by only a subset of processes. This
     * behavior may seem surprising, unless you know that write/addition
     * operations on single elements may trigger this behavior.
     *
     * The problem described here may be avoided by placing additional calls
     * to compress(), or making sure that all processes do the same type of
     * operations at the same time, for example by placing zero additions if
     * necessary.

      // memory on the heap, which is
      // expensive. an alternative would be to
      // split the vector into chunks of, say,
      // 128 elements, convert a chunk at a
      // time and set it in the output vector
      // using VecSetValues. since 128 elements
      // is small enough, this could easily be
      // allocated on the stack (as a local
      // variable) which would make the whole
      // thing much more efficient.
      //
      // a second way to make things faster is
      // for the special case that
      // number==PetscScalar. we could then
      // declare a specialization of this
      // template, and omit the conversion. the
      // problem with this is that the best we
      // can do is to use VecSetValues, but
      // this isn't very efficient either: it
      // wants to see an array of indices,
      // which in this case a) again takes up a
      // whole lot of memory on the heap, and
      // b) is totally dumb since its content
      // would simply be the sequence
      // 0,1,2,3,...,n. the best of all worlds
      // would probably be a function in Petsc
      // that would take a pointer to an array
      // of PetscScalar values and simply copy
      // n elements verbatim into the vector...
