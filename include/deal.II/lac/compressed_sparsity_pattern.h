/**
 * This class acts as an intermediate form of the SparsityPattern class. From
 * the interface it mostly represents a SparsityPattern object that is kept
 * compressed at all times. However, since the final sparsity pattern is not
 * known while constructing it, keeping the pattern compressed at all times
 * can only be achieved at the expense of either increased memory or run time
 * consumption upon use. The main purpose of this class is to avoid some
 * memory bottlenecks, so we chose to implement it memory conservative, but
 * the chosen data format is too unsuited to be used for actual matrices. It
 * is therefore necessary to first copy the data of this object over to an
 * object of type SparsityPattern before using it in actual matrices.
 *
 * Another viewpoint is that this class does not need up front allocation of a
 * certain amount of memory, but grows as necessary.  An extensive description
 * of sparsity patterns can be found in the documentation of the
 * @ref Sparsity
 * module.
 *
 * This class is an example of the "dynamic" type of
 * @ref Sparsity.
 *
 * <h3>Interface</h3>
 *
 * Since this class is intended as an intermediate replacement of the
 * SparsityPattern class, it has mostly the same interface, with small changes
 * where necessary. In particular, the add() function, and the functions
 * inquiring properties of the sparsity pattern are the same.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Use this class as follows:
 * @code
 * CompressedSparsityPattern compressed_pattern (dof_handler.n_dofs());
 * DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern (dof_handler,
 *                                  compressed_pattern);
 * constraints.condense (compressed_pattern);
 *
 * SparsityPattern sp;
 * sp.copy_from (compressed_pattern);
 * @endcode
 *
 * See also step-11 and step-18 for usage patterns.
 *
 * <h3>Notes</h3>
 *
 * There are several, exchangeable variations of this class, see
 * @ref Sparsity,
 * section '"Dynamic" or "compressed" sparsity patterns' for more information.

   * with same column number has already been added. Only if the cache is full
   * do we flush it by removing duplicates, removing entries that are already
   * stored in the @p entries array, sorting everything, and merging the two
   * arrays.
   *
   * The reasoning behind this scheme is that memory allocation is expensive,
   * and we only want to do it when really necessary. Previously (in deal.II
   * versions up to 5.0), we used to store the column indices inside a
   * std::set, but this would allocate 20 bytes each time we added an entry.
   * (A std::set based class has later been revived in form of the
   * CompressedSetSparsityPattern class, as this turned out to be more
   * efficient for hp finite element programs such as step-27). Using the
   * present scheme, we only need to allocate memory once for every 8 added
   * entries, and we waste a lot less memory by not using a balanced tree for
   * storing column indices.
   *
   * Since some functions that are @p const need to access the data of this
   * object, but need to flush caches before, the flush_cache() function is
   * marked const, and the data members are marked @p mutable.
   *
   * A small testseries about the size of the cache showed that the run time
   * of a small program just testing the compressed sparsity pattern element
   * insertion routine ran for 3.6 seconds with a cache size of 8, and 4.2
   * seconds with a cache size of 16. We deem even smaller cache sizes
   * undesirable, since they lead to more memory allocations, while larger
   * cache sizes lead to waste of memory. The original version of this class,
   * with one std::set per row took 8.2 seconds on the same program.
