/**

{
  /**
   * Interface to SUNDIALS additive Runge-Kutta methods (ARKode).
   *
   * The class ARKode is a wrapper to SUNDIALS variable-step, embedded,
   * additive Runge-Kutta solver which is a general purpose solver for systems
   * of ordinary differential equations characterized by the presence of both
   * fast and slow dynamics.
   *
   * Fast dynamics are treated implicitly, and slow dynamics are treated
   * explicitly, using nested families of implicit and explicit Runge-Kutta
   * solvers.
   *
   * Citing directly from ARKode documentation:
   *
   * ARKode solves ODE initial value problems (IVPs) in $R^N$. These problems
   * should be posed in explicit form as
   *
   * \f[
   *   M\dot y = f_E(t, y) + f_I (t, y), \qquad y(t_0) = y_0.
   * \f]
   *
   * Here, $t$ is the independent variable (e.g. time), and the dependent
   * variables are given by $y \in R^N$, and we use notation $\dot y$ to denote
   * $dy/dt$. $M$ is a user-supplied nonsingular operator from $R^N \to R^N$.
   * This operator may depend on $t$ but not on $y$.
   *
   * For standard systems of ordinary differential equations and for problems
   * arising from the spatial semi-discretization of partial differential
   * equations using finite difference or finite volume methods, $M$ is
   * typically the identity matrix, $I$. For PDEs using a finite-element
   * spatial semi-discretization $M$ is typically a well-conditioned mass
   * matrix.
   *
   * The two right-hand side functions may be described as:
   *
   * - $f_E(t, y)$: contains the "slow" time scale components of the system.
   *                This will be integrated using explicit methods.
   * - $f_I(t, y)$: contains the "fast" time scale components of the system.
   *                This will be integrated using implicit methods.
   *
   * ARKode may be used to solve stiff, nonstiff and multi-rate problems.
   * Roughly speaking, stiffness is characterized by the presence of at least
   * one rapidly damped mode, whose time constant is small compared to the time
   * scale of the solution itself. In the implicit/explicit (ImEx) splitting
   * above, these stiff components should be included in the right-hand side
   * function $f_I (t, y)$.
   *
   * For multi-rate problems, a user should provide both of the functions $f_E$
   * and $f_I$ that define the IVP system.
   *
   * For nonstiff problems, only $f_E$ should be provided, and $f_I$ is assumed
   * to be zero, i.e. the system reduces to the non-split IVP:
   *
   * \f[
   *   M\dot y = f_E(t, y), \qquad y(t_0) = y_0.
   * \f]
   *
   * In this scenario, the ARK methods reduce to classical explicit Runge-Kutta
   * methods (ERK). For these classes of methods, ARKode allows orders of
   * accuracy $q = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8\}$, with embeddings of orders $p = \{1,
   * 2, 3, 4, 5, 7\}$. These default to the Heun-Euler-2-1-2,
   * Bogacki-Shampine-4-2-3, Zonneveld-5-3-4, Cash-Karp-6-4-5, Verner-8-5-6 and
   * Fehlberg-13-7-8 methods, respectively.
   *
   * Finally, for stiff (linear or nonlinear) problems the user may provide only
   * $f_I$, implying that $f_E = 0$, so that the system reduces to the non-split
   * IVP
   *
   * \f[
   *   M\dot y = f_I(t, y), \qquad y(t_0) = y_0.
   * \f]
   *
   * Similarly to ERK methods, in this scenario the ARK methods reduce to
   * classical diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta methods (DIRK). For these
   * classes of methods, ARKode allows orders of accuracy $q = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}$,
   * with embeddings of orders $p = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. These default to the
   * SDIRK-2-1-2, ARK-4-2-3 (implicit), SDIRK-5-3-4 and ARK-8-4-5 (implicit)
   * methods, respectively.
   *
   * For both DIRK and ARK methods, an implicit system of the form
   * \f[
   *  G(z_i) \dealcoloneq M z_i - h_n A^I_{i,i} f_I (t^I_{n,i}, z_i) - a_i = 0
   * \f]
   * must be solved for each stage $z_i , i = 1, \ldots, s$, where
   * we have the data
   * \f[
   *  a_i \dealcoloneq
   *  M y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} [ A^E_{i,j} f_E(t^E_{n,j}, z_j)
   *  + A^I_{i,j} f_I (t^I_{n,j}, z_j)]
   * \f]
   * for the ARK methods, or
   * \f[
   *  a_i \dealcoloneq
   *  M y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} A^I_{i,j} f_I (t^I_{n,j}, z_j)
   * \f]
   * for the DIRK methods. Here $A^I_{i,j}$ and $A^E_{i,j}$ are the Butcher's
   * tables for the chosen solver.
   *
   * If $f_I(t,y)$ depends nonlinearly on $y$ then the systems above correspond
   * to a nonlinear system of equations; if $f_I (t, y)$ depends linearly on
   * $y$ then this is a linear system of equations. By specifying the flag
   * `implicit_function_is_linear`, ARKode takes some shortcuts that allow a
   * faster solution process.
   *
   * For systems of either type, ARKode allows a choice of solution strategy.
   * The default solver choice is a variant of Newton's method,
   * \f[
   *  z_i^{m+1} = z_i^m +\delta^{m+1},
   * \f]
   * where $m$ is the Newton index, and the Newton update $\delta^{m+1}$
   * requires the solution of the linear Newton system
   * \f[
   *  N(z_i^m) \delta^{m+1} = -G(z_i^m),
   * \f]
   * where
   * \f[
   * N \dealcoloneq M - \gamma J, \quad J
   * \dealcoloneq \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial y},
   * \qquad \gamma\dealcoloneq h_n A^I_{i,i}.
   * \f]
   *
   * As an alternate to Newton's method, ARKode may solve for each stage $z_i ,i
   * = 1, \ldots , s$ using an Anderson-accelerated fixed point iteration
   * \f[
   * z_i^{m+1} = g(z_i^{m}), m=0,1,\ldots.
   * \f]
   *
   * Unlike with Newton's method, this option does not require the solution of
   * a linear system at each iteration, instead opting for solution of a
   * low-dimensional least-squares solution to construct the nonlinear update.
   *
   * Finally, if the user specifies `implicit_function_is_linear`, i.e.,
   * $f_I(t, y)$ depends linearly on $y$, and if the Newton-based nonlinear
   * solver is chosen, then the system will be solved using only a single
   * Newton iteration. Notice that in order for the Newton solver to be used,
   * at least the solve_jacobian_system() function should be supplied. If this
   * function is not supplied, then only the fixed-point iteration will be
   * supported, and the `implicit_function_is_linear` setting is ignored.
   *
   * The optimal solver (Newton vs fixed-point) is highly problem-dependent.
   * Since fixed-point solvers do not require the solution of any linear
   * systems, each iteration may be significantly less costly than their Newton
   * counterparts. However, this can come at the cost of slower convergence (or
   * even divergence) in comparison with Newton-like methods. These fixed-point
   * solvers do allow for user specification of the Anderson-accelerated
   * subspace size, $m_k$. While the required amount of solver memory grows
   * proportionately to $m_k N$, larger values of $m_k$ may result in faster
   * convergence.
   *
   * This improvement may be significant even for "small" values, e.g. $1 \leq
   * m_k \leq 5$, and convergence may not improve (or even deteriorate) for
   * larger values of $m_k$. While ARKode uses a Newton-based iteration as its
   * default solver due to its increased robustness on very stiff problems, it
   * is highly recommended that users also consider the fixed-point solver for
   * their cases when attempting a new problem.
   *
   * For either the Newton or fixed-point solvers, it is well-known that both
   * the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm intimately depends on the
   * choice of a good initial guess. In ARKode, the initial guess for either
   * nonlinear solution method is a predicted value $z_i(0)$ that is computed
   * explicitly from the previously-computed data (e.g. $y_{n-2}, y_{n-1}$, and
   * $z_j$ where $j < i$). Additional information on the specific predictor
   * algorithms implemented in ARKode is provided in ARKode documentation.
   *
   * The user has to provide the implementation of the following std::function:
   *  - reinit_vector;
   * and either one or both of
   *  - implicit_function;
   *  - explicit_function;
   *
   * If the mass matrix is different from the identity, the user should supply
   *  - solve_mass_system;
   * and, optionally,
   *  - setup_mass;
   *
   * If the use of a Newton method is desired, then the user should also supply
   *  - solve_jacobian_system;
   * and optionally
   *  - setup_jacobian;
   *
   * Also the following functions could be rewritten. By default
   * they do nothing, or are not required.
   *  - solver_should_restart;
   *  - get_local_tolerances;
   *
   * To produce output at fixed steps, overload the function
   *  - output_step;
   *
   *
   * To provide a simple example, consider the harmonic oscillator problem:
   * \f[
   * \begin{split}
   *   u'' & = -k^2 u \\
   *   u (0) & = 0 \\
   *   u'(0) & = k
   * \end{split}
   * \f]
   *
   * We write it in terms of a first order ode:
   *\f[
   * \begin{matrix}
   *   y_0' & =  y_1 \\
   *   y_1' & = - k^2 y_0
   * \end{matrix}
   * \f]
   *
   * That is $y' = A y$
   * where
   * \f[
   * A \dealcoloneq
   * \begin{matrix}
   * 0 & 1 \\
   * -k^2 &0
   * \end{matrix}
   * \f]
   * and $y(0)=(0, k)$.
   *
   * The exact solution is $y_0(t) = \sin(k t)$, $y_1(t) = y_0'(t) = k \cos(k
   *t)$, $y_1'(t) = -k^2 \sin(k t)$.
   *
   * A minimal implementation, using only explicit RK methods, is given by the
   * following code snippet:
   *
   * @code
   * using VectorType = Vector<double>;
   *
   * SUNDIALS::ARKode<VectorType> ode;
   *
   * ode.reinit_vector = [] (VectorType&v)
   * {
   *   v.reinit(2);
   * };
   *
   * double kappa = 1.0;
   *
   * ode.explicit_function = [kappa] (double,
   *                                  const VectorType &y,
   *                                  VectorType &ydot) -> int
   * {
   *   ydot[0] = y[1];
   *   ydot[1] = -kappa*kappa*y[0];
   *   return 0;
   * };
   *
   * Vector<double> y(2);
   * y[1] = kappa;
   *
   * ode.solve_ode(y);

     *
     * Make sure that after a call to this function, we know how to compute
     * solutions of systems $A x = b$, where $A$ is some approximation to the
     * Newton matrix, $M - \gamma \partial f_I/\partial y$. This function is
     * optional. If the user does not provide it, then solve_jacobian_system()
     * is assumed to also perform the setup internally.
     *
     * The setup_jacobian() function may call a user-supplied function to
     * compute needed data related to the Jacobian matrix. Alternatively, it may
     * choose to retrieve and use stored values of this data. In either case,
     * setup_jacobian() may also preprocess that data as needed for
     * solve_jacobian_system(), which may involve calling a generic function
     * (such as for LU factorization).
     *
     * This data may be intended either for direct use (in a direct linear
     * solver) or for use in a preconditioner (in a preconditioned iterative
     * linear solver). The setup_jacobian() function is not called at every
     * stage solve (or even every time step), but only as frequently as the
     * solver determines that it is appropriate to perform the setup task. In
     * this way, Jacobian-related data generated by setup_jacobian() is
     * expected to be used over a number of time steps.
     *
     * If the user uses a matrix based computation of the Jacobian, then this
     * is the right place where an assembly routine shoulde be called to
     * assemble both a matrix and a preconditioner for the Jacobian system.
     * Subsequent calls (possibly more than one) to solve_jacobian_system() can
     * assume that this function has been called at least once.
     *
     * Notice that no assumption is made by this interface on what the user
     * should do in this function. ARKode only assumes that after a call to
     * setup_jacobian() it is possible to call solve_jacobian_system(), to
     * obtain a solution $x$ to the system $J x = b$. If this function is not
     * provided, then it is never called.
     *
     * Arguments to the function are
     *
     * @param[in] t  the current time
     * @param[in] gamma  the current factor to use in the jacobian computation
     * @param[in] ypred  is the predicted $y$ vector for the current ARKode
     * internal step
     * @param[in] fpred  is the value of the implicit right-hand side at ypred,
     *        $f_I (t_n, ypred)$.
     *
     * @param[in] convfail Input flag used to indicate any problem that
     * occurred during the solution of the nonlinear equation on the current
     * time step for which the linear solver is being used. This flag can be
     * used to help decide whether the Jacobian data kept by a linear solver
     * needs to be updated or not. Its possible values are:
     *
     *   - ARK_NO_FAILURES: this value is passed if either this is the first
     * call for this step, or the local error test failed on the previous
     * attempt at this step (but the Newton iteration converged).
     *
     *   - ARK_FAIL_BAD_J: this value is passed if (a) the previous Newton
     *     corrector iteration did not converge and the linear solver's setup
     *     function indicated that its Jacobian-related data is not current, or
     * (b) during the previous Newton corrector iteration, the linear solver's
     *     solve function failed in a recoverable manner and the linear solver's
     *     setup function indicated that its Jacobian-related data is not
     * current.
     *
     *   - ARK_FAIL_OTHER: this value is passed if during the current internal
     *     step try, the previous Newton iteration failed to converge even
     * though the linear solver was using current Jacobian-related data.
     *
     * @param[out] j_is_current: a boolean to be filled in by setup_jacobian().
     * The value should be set to `true` if the Jacobian data is current after
     * the call, and should be set to `false` if its Jacobian data is not
     * current. If setup_jacobian() calls for re-evaluation of Jacobian data
     * (based on convfail and ARKode state data), then it should set
     * `j_is_current` to `true` unconditionally, otherwise an infinite loop can
     * result.
     *
     * This function should return:
     * - 0: Success
     * - >0: Recoverable error (ARKodeReinit will be called if this happens, and
     *       then last function will be attempted again
