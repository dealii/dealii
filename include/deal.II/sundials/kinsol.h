  /**
   * Interface to SUNDIALS non linear solver (KINSOL).
   *
   * KINSOL is a solver for nonlinear algebraic systems in residual form $F(u)
   * = 0$ or fixed point form $G(u) = u$, where $u$ is a vector which we will
   * assume to be in ${\mathbb R}^n$ or ${\mathbb C}^n$, but that may also have
   * a block structure and may be distributed in parallel computations; the
   * functions $F$ and $G$ satisfy $F,G:{\mathbb R}^N \to{\mathbb R}^N$ or
   * $F,G:{\mathbb C}^N \to{\mathbb C}^N$. It includes a Newton-Krylov solver
   * as well as Picard and fixed point solvers, both of which can be
   * accelerated with Anderson acceleration. KINSOL is based on the previous
   * Fortran package NKSOL of Brown and Saad.
   *
   * KINSOL's Newton solver employs the inexact Newton method. As this solver
   * is intended mainly for large systems, the user is required to provide
   * their own solver function. If a solver function is not provided, the
   * internal dense solver of KINSOL is used. Be warned that this solver
   * computes the Jacobian approximately, and may be efficient only for small
   * systems.
   *
   * At the highest level, KINSOL implements the following iteration
   * scheme:
   *  - set $u_0$ = an initial guess
   *  - For $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ until convergence do:
   *    - Solve $J(u_n)\delta_n = -F(u_n)$
   *    - Set $u_{n+1} = u_n + \lambda \delta_n, 0 < \lambda \leq 1$
   *    - Test for convergence
   *
   * Here, $u_n$ is the $n$-th iterate to $u$, and $J(u) = \nabla_u F(u)$ is
   * the system Jacobian. At each stage in the iteration process, a scalar
   * multiple of the step $\delta_n$, is added to $u_n$ to produce a new
   * iterate, $u_{n+1}$. A test for convergence is made before the iteration
   * continues.
   *
   * Unless specified otherwise by the user, KINSOL strives to update Jacobian
   * information as infrequently as possible to balance the high costs of
   * matrix operations against other costs. Specifically, these updates occur
   * when:
   * - the problem is initialized,
   * - $\|\lambda \delta_{n-1} \|_{D_u,\infty} \geq 1.5$ (inexact Newton only,
   *   see below for a definition of $\| \cdot \|_{D_u,\infty}$)
   * - a specified number of  nonlinear iterations have passed since the last
   *   update,
   * - the linear solver failed recoverably with outdated Jacobian information,
   * - the global strategy failed with outdated Jacobian information, or
   * - $\|\lambda \delta_{n} \|_{D_u,\infty} \leq $ *tolerance* with outdated
   *   Jacobian information.
   *
   * KINSOL allows changes to the above strategy through optional solver
   * inputs. The user can disable the initial Jacobian information evaluation
   * or change the default value of the number of nonlinear iterations after
   * which a Jacobian information update is enforced.
   *
   * To address the case of ill-conditioned nonlinear systems, KINSOL allows
   * prescribing scaling factors both for the solution vector and for the
   * residual vector. For scaling to be used, the user may supply the function
   * get_solution_scaling(), that returns values $D_u$, which are diagonal
   * elements of the scaling matrix such that $D_u u_n$ has all components
   * roughly the same magnitude when $u_n$ is close to a solution, and
   * get_function_scaling(), that supply values $D_F$, which are diagonal
   * scaling matrix elements such that $D_F F$ has all components roughly the
   * same magnitude when $u_n$ is *not* too close to a solution.
   *
   * When scaling values are provided for the solution vector, these values are
   * automatically incorporated into the calculation of the perturbations used
   * for the default difference quotient approximations for Jacobian
   * information if the user does not supply a Jacobian solver through the
   * solve_jacobian_system() function.
   *
   * Two methods of applying a computed step $\delta_n$ to the previously
   * computed solution vector are implemented. The first and simplest is the
   * standard Newton strategy which applies the update with a constant
   * $\lambda$ always set to 1. The other method is a global strategy, which
   * attempts to use the direction implied by $\delta_n$ in the most efficient
   * way for furthering convergence of the nonlinear problem. This technique is
   * implemented in the second strategy, called Linesearch. This option employs
   * both the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ conditions of the Goldstein-Armijo
   * linesearch algorithm given in *J. E. Dennis and R. B. Schnabel. "Numerical
   * Methods for Unconstrained Optimization and Nonlinear Equations." SIAM,
   * Philadelphia, 1996.*, where $\lambda$ is chosen to guarantee a sufficient
   * decrease in $F$ relative to the step length as well as a minimum step
   * length relative to the initial rate of decrease of $F$. One property of the
   * algorithm is that the full Newton step tends to be taken close to the
   * solution.
   *
   * As a user option, KINSOL permits the application of inequality
   * constraints, $u_i > 0$ and $u_i < 0$, as well as $u_i \geq 0$ and $u_i
   * \leq 0$, where $u_i$ is the $i$-th component of $u$. Any such constraint,
   * or no constraint, may be imposed on each component by providing the
   * optional functions
   * - get_lower_than_zero_constrained_entries()
   * - get_greater_than_zero_constrained_entries()
   * - get_lower_equal_than_zero_constrained_entries()
   * - get_greater_or_equal_than_zero_constrained_entries()
   *
   * KINSOL will reduce step lengths in order to ensure that no constraint is
   * violated. Specifically, if a new Newton iterate will violate a constraint,
   * the maximum step length along the Newton direction that will satisfy all
   * constraints is found, and $\delta_n$ is scaled to take a step of that
   * length.
   *
   * The basic fixed-point iteration scheme implemented in KINSOL is given by:
   * - Set $u_0 =$ an initial guess
   * - For $n = 0, 1, 2, \dots$ until convergence do:
   *   - Set $u_{n+1} = G(u_n)$
   *   - Test for convergence
   *
   * At each stage in the iteration process, function $G$ is applied to the
   * current iterate to produce a new iterate, $u_{n+1}$. A test for
   * convergence is made before the iteration continues.
   *
   * For Picard iteration, as implemented in KINSOL, we consider a special form
   * of the nonlinear function $F$, such that $F(u) = Lu - N(u)$, where $L$ is
   * a constant nonsingular matrix and $N$ is (in general) nonlinear.
   *
   * Then the fixed-point function $G$ is defined as $G(u) = u - L^{-1}F(u)$.
   * Within each iteration, the Picard step is computed then added to $u_n$ to
   * produce the new iterate. Next, the nonlinear residual function is
   * evaluated at the new iterate, and convergence is checked. The Picard and
   * fixed point methods can be significantly accelerated using Anderson's
   * method.
   *
   * The user has to provide the implementation of the following std::functions:
   *  - reinit_vector;
   * and only one of
   *  - residual;
   * or
   *  - iteration_function;
   *
   * Specifying residual() allows the user to use Newton strategies (i.e.,
   * $F(u)=0$ will be solved), while specifying iteration_function(), fixed
   * point iteration or Picard iteration will be used (i.e., $G(u)=u$ will be
   * solved).
   *
   * If the use of a Newton method is desired, then the user should also supply
   *  - solve_jacobian_system;
   * and optionally
   *  - setup_jacobian;
   *
   * If the solve_jacobian_system() function is not supplied, then KINSOL will
   * use its internal dense solver for Newton methods, with approximate
   * Jacobian. This may be very expensive for large systems. Fixed point
   * iteration does not require the solution of any linear system.
   *
   * Also the following functions could be rewritten, to provide additional
   * scaling factors for both the solution and the residual evaluation during
   * convergence checks:
   *  - get_solution_scaling;
   *  - get_function_scaling;

     * @param[in] ycur The current $y$ vector for the current KINSOL
     * internal step. In the documentation above, this $y$ vector is generally
     * denoted by $u$.
     * @param[in] fcur The current value of the implicit right-hand side at

     * @param[in] rhs The system right hand side to solve for
     * @param[out] dst The solution of $J^{-1} * src$
     *
     * This function should return:
     * - 0: Success
     * - >0: Recoverable error (KINSOL will try to change its internal

     * - <0: Unrecoverable error the computation will be aborted and an
     * assertion will be thrown.
     *
     * @warning Starting with SUNDIALS 4.1, SUNDIALS no longer provides the
     *   `ycur` and `fcur` variables -- only `rhs` is provided and `dst`
     *   needs to be returned. The first two arguments will therefore be
     *   empty vectors in that case. In practice, that means that one
     *   can no longer compute a Jacobian matrix for the current iterate
     *   within this function. Rather, this has to happen inside the
     *   `setup_jacobian` function above that receives this information.
     *   If it is important that the Jacobian corresponds to the *current*
     *   iterate (rather than a re-used Jacobian matrix that had been
     *   computed in a previous iteration and that therefore corresponds
     *   to a *previous* iterate), then you will also have to set the
     *   AdditionalData::maximum_newton_step variable to one, indicating
     *   that the Jacobian should be re-computed in every iteration.

    /**
     * A function object that users may supply and that is intended to return a
     * vector whose components are the weights used by KINSOL to compute the
     * vector norm of the solution. The implementation of this function is
     * optional, and it is used only if implemented.
     *
     * The intent for this scaling factor is for problems in which the different
     * components of a solution have vastly different numerical magnitudes --
     * typically because they have different physical units and represent
     * different things. For example, if one were to solve a nonlinear Stokes
     * problem, the solution vector has components that correspond to velocities
     * and other components that correspond to pressures. These have different
     * physical units and depending on which units one chooses, they may have
     * roughly comparable numerical sizes or maybe they don't. To give just one
     * example, in simulations of flow in the Earth's interior, one has
     * velocities on the order of maybe ten centimeters per year, and pressures
     * up to around 100 GPa. If one expresses this in SI units, this corresponds
     * to velocities of around $0.000,000,003=3 \times 10^{-9}$ m/s, and
     * pressures around $10^9 \text{kg}/\text{m}/\text{s}^2$, i.e., vastly
     * different. In such cases, computing the $l_2$ norm of a solution-type
     * vector (e.g., the difference between the previous and the current
     * solution) makes no sense because the norm will either be dominated by the
     * velocity components or the pressure components. The scaling vector this
     * function returns is intended to provide each component of the solution
     * with a scaling factor that is generally chosen as as the inverse of a
     * "typical velocity" or "typical pressure" so that upon multiplication of a
     * vector component by the corresponding scaling vector component, one
     * obtains a number that is of order of magnitude of one (i.e., a reasonably
     * small multiple of one times the typical velocity/pressure). The KINSOL
     * manual states this as follows: "The user should supply values $D_u$,
     * which are diagonal elements of the scaling matrix such that $D_u U$ has
     * all components roughly the same magnitude when $U$ is close to a
     * solution".
     *
     * If no function is provided to a KINSOL object, then this is interpreted
     * as implicitly saying that all of these scaling factors should be
     * considered as one.
