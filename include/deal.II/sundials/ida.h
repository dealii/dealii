  /**
   * Interface to SUNDIALS Implicit Differential-Algebraic (IDA) solver.
   *
   * The class IDA is a wrapper to SUNDIALS Implicit Differential-Algebraic
   * solver which is a general purpose solver for systems of
   * Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs).
   *
   * The user has to provide the implementation of the following std::functions:
   *  - reinit_vector;
   *  - residual;
   *  - setup_jacobian;
   *  - solve_jacobian_system;
   *
   * Optionally, also the following functions could be rewritten. By default
   * they do nothing, or are not required. If you call the constructor in a way
   * that requires a not-implemented function, an Assertion will be
   * thrown.
   *  - solver_should_restart;
   *  - differential_components;
   *  - get_local_tolerances;
   *
   * To output steps, connect a function to the signal
   *  - output_step;
   *
   * Citing from the SUNDIALS documentation:
   *
   *   Consider a system of Differential-Algebraic Equations written in the
   *   general form
   *
   * \f[
   *   \begin{cases}
   *       F(t,y,\dot y) = 0\, , \\
   *       y(t_0) = y_0\, , \\
   *       \dot y (t_0) = \dot y_0\, .
   *   \end{cases}
   * \f]
   *
   * where $y,\dot y$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $t$ is often the time (but
   * can also be a parametric quantity), and
   * $F:\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$.
   * Such problem is solved using Newton iteration augmented with a line search
   * global strategy. The integration method used in IDA is the variable-order,
   * variable-coefficient BDF (Backward Differentiation Formula), in
   * fixed-leading-coefficient. The method order ranges from 1 to 5, with
   * the BDF of order $q$ given by the multistep formula
   *
   * \f[
   *   \sum_{i=0}^q \alpha_{n,i}\,y_{n-i}=h_n\,\dot y_n\, ,
   *   \label{eq:bdf}
   * \f]
   *
   * where $y_n$ and $\dot y_n$ are the computed approximations of $y(t_n)$
   * and $\dot y(t_n)$, respectively, and the step size is
   * $h_n=t_n-t_{n-1}$. The coefficients $\alpha_{n,i}$ are uniquely
   * determined by the order $q$, and the history of the step sizes. The
   * application of the BDF method to the DAE system results in a nonlinear
   *algebraic system to be solved at each time step:
   *
   * \f[
   *   G(y_n)\equiv F\left(t_n,y_n,\dfrac{1}{h_n}\sum_{i=0}^q
   *  \alpha_{n,i}\,y_{n-i}\right)=0\, .
   * \f]
   * The Newton method leads to a linear system of the form
   * \f[
   *   J[y_{n(m+1)}-y_{n(m)}]=-G(y_{n(m)})\, ,
   * \f]
   *
   *where $y_{n(m)}$ is the $m$-th approximation to $y_n$, and $J$ is the
   *approximation of the system Jacobian
   *
   * \f[
   *   J=\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial y} = \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial y} +
   *  \alpha \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial \dot y}\, ,
   * \f]
   *
   * and $\alpha = \alpha_{n,0}/h_n$. It is worth mentioning that the
   * scalar $\alpha$ changes whenever the step size or method order
   * changes.
   *
   * To provide a simple example, consider the following harmonic oscillator
   *problem: \f[ \begin{split}
   *   u'' & = -k^2 u \\
   *   u (0) & = 0 \\
   *   u'(0) & = k
   * \end{split}
   * \f]
   *
   * We write it in terms of a first order ode:
   *\f[
   * \begin{matrix}
   *   y_0' & -y_1      & = 0 \\
   *   y_1' & + k^2 y_0 & = 0
   * \end{matrix}
   * \f]
   *
   * That is $F(y', y, t) = y' + A y = 0 $
   * where
   * \f[
   * \begin{matrix}
   * 0 & -1 \\
   * k^2 &0
   * \end{matrix}
   * \f]
   * and $y(0)=(0, k)$, $y'(0) = (k, 0)$.
   *
   * The exact solution is $y_0(t) = \sin(k t)$, $y_1(t) = y_0'(t) = k \cos(k
   *t)$, $y_1'(t) = -k^2 \sin(k t)$.
   *
   * The Jacobian to assemble is the following:  $J = \alpha I + A$.
   *
   * This is achieved by the following snippet of code:
   * @code
   * using VectorType = Vector<double>;
   *
   * VectorType y(2);
   * VectorType y_dot(2);
   *
   * double kappa = 1.0;
   *
   * FullMatrix<double> A(2,2);
   * A(0,1) = -1.0;
   * A(1,0) = kappa*kappa;

   * FullMatrix<double> Jinv(2,2);

     * Constructor. It is possible to fine tune the SUNDIALS IDA solver by
     * passing an AdditionalData() object that sets all of the solver
     * parameters.
     *
     * IDA is a Differential Algebraic solver. As such, it requires initial
     * conditions also for the first order derivatives. If you do not provide
     * consistent initial conditions, (i.e., conditions for which F(y_dot(0),
     * y(0), 0) = 0), you can ask SUNDIALS to compute initial conditions for you
     * by using the `ic_type` parameter at construction time.
     *
     * You have three options
     * -  none: do not try to make initial conditions consistent.
     * -  use_y_diff: compute the algebraic components of y and differential
     *    components of y_dot, given the differential components of y.
     *    This option requires that the user specifies differential and
     *    algebraic components in the function get_differential_components.
     * -  use_y_dot: compute all components of y, given y_dot.
     *
     * By default, this class assumes that all components are differential, and
     * that you want to solve a standard ode. In this case, the initial
     * component type is set to `use_y_diff`, so that the `y_dot` at time
     * t=`initial_time` is computed by solving the nonlinear problem $F(y_dot,
     * y(t0), t0) = 0$ in the variable `y_dot`.
     *
     * Notice that a Newton solver is used for this computation. The Newton
     * solver parameters can be tweaked by acting on `ic_alpha` and
     * `ic_max_iter`.
     *
     * If you reset the solver at some point, you may want to select a different
     * computation for the initial conditions after reset. Say, for example,
     * that you have refined a grid, and after transferring the solution to the
     * new grid, the initial conditions are no longer consistent. Then you can
     * choose how these are made consistent, using the same three options that
     * you used for the initial conditions in `reset_type`.
     *
     * The MPI communicator is simply ignored in the serial case.
