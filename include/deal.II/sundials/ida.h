  /**
   * Interface to SUNDIALS Implicit Differential-Algebraic (IDA) solver.
   *
   * The class IDA is a wrapper to SUNDIALS Implicit Differential-Algebraic
   * solver which is a general purpose solver for systems of
   * Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs). Another class that can solve
   * this set of equations is PETScWrappers::TimeStepper.
   *
   * The user has to provide the implementation of the following std::functions:
   *  - reinit_vector;
   *  - residual;
   *  - setup_jacobian;
   *  - solve_with_jacobian;
   *
   * Optionally, also the following functions could be provided. By default
   * they do nothing, or are not required. If you call the constructor in a way
   * that requires a not-implemented function, an Assertion will be
   * thrown.
   *  - solver_should_restart;
   *  - differential_components;
   *  - get_local_tolerances;
   *
   * To output steps, connect a function to the signal
   *  - output_step;
   *
   * Citing from the SUNDIALS documentation:
   *
   *   Consider a system of Differential-Algebraic Equations written in the
   *   general form
   *
   * \f[
   *   \begin{cases}
   *       F(t,y,\dot y) = 0\, , \\
   *       y(t_0) = y_0\, , \\
   *       \dot y (t_0) = \dot y_0\, .
   *   \end{cases}
   * \f]
   *
   * where $y,\dot y$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $t$ is often the time (but
   * can also be a parametric quantity), and
   * $F:\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$.
   * Such problem is solved using Newton iteration augmented with a line search
   * global strategy. The integration method used in IDA is the variable-order,
   * variable-coefficient BDF (Backward Differentiation Formula), in
   * fixed-leading-coefficient. The method order ranges from 1 to 5, with
   * the BDF of order $q$ given by the multistep formula
   *
   * \f[
   *   \sum_{i=0}^q \alpha_{n,i}\,y_{n-i}=h_n\,\dot y_n\, ,
   *   \label{eq:bdf}
   * \f]
   *
   * where $y_n$ and $\dot y_n$ are the computed approximations of $y(t_n)$
   * and $\dot y(t_n)$, respectively, and the step size is
   * $h_n=t_n-t_{n-1}$. The coefficients $\alpha_{n,i}$ are uniquely
   * determined by the order $q$, and the history of the step sizes. The
   * application of the BDF method to the DAE system results in a nonlinear
   *algebraic system to be solved at each time step:
   *
   * \f[
   *   G(y_n)\equiv F\left(t_n,y_n,\dfrac{1}{h_n}\sum_{i=0}^q
   *  \alpha_{n,i}\,y_{n-i}\right)=0\, .
   * \f]
   * The Newton method leads to a linear system of the form
   * \f[
   *   J[y_{n(m+1)}-y_{n(m)}]=-G(y_{n(m)})\, ,
   * \f]
   *
   *where $y_{n(m)}$ is the $m$-th approximation to $y_n$, and $J$ is the
   *approximation of the system Jacobian
   *
   * \f[
   *   J=\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial y}
   *   = \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial y} +
   *     \alpha \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial \dot y}\, ,
   * \f]
   *
   * and $\alpha = \alpha_{n,0}/h_n$. It is worth mentioning that the
   * scalar $\alpha$ changes whenever the step size or method order
   * changes.
   *
   *
   * <h3> A simple example: an ordinary differential equation </h3>
   *
   * To provide a simple example, consider the following harmonic oscillator
   * problem:
   * \f[ \begin{split}
   *   u'' & = -k^2 u \\
   *   u (0) & = 0 \\
   *   u'(0) & = k
   * \end{split}
   * \f]
   *
   * We write it in terms of a first order ode:
   *\f[
   * \begin{matrix}
   *   y_0' & -y_1      & = 0 \\
   *   y_1' & + k^2 y_0 & = 0
   * \end{matrix}
   * \f]
   *
   * That is, $F(y', y, t) = y' + A y = 0 $
   * where
   * \f[
   * A =
   * \begin{pmatrix}
   * 0 & -1 \\
   * k^2 &0
   * \end{pmatrix}
   * \f]
   * and $y(0)=(0, k)$, $y'(0) = (k, 0)$.
   *
   * The exact solution is $y_0(t) = \sin(k t)$, $y_1(t) = y_0'(t)
   * = k \cos(k t)$, $y_1'(t) = -k^2 \sin(k t)$.
   *
   * The Jacobian to assemble is the following:  $J = \alpha I + A$.
   *
   * This is achieved by the following snippet of code:
   * @code
   * using VectorType = Vector<double>;
   *
   * VectorType y(2);
   * VectorType y_dot(2);
   *
   * double kappa = 1.0;
   *
   * FullMatrix<double> A(2,2);
   * A(0,1) = -1.0;
   * A(1,0) = kappa*kappa;
   *
   * FullMatrix<double> J(2,2);
   * FullMatrix<double> Jinv(2,2);
   *
   * IDA time_stepper;
   *
   * time_stepper.reinit_vector = [&] (VectorType&v)
   * {
   *   v.reinit(2);

   *                             VectorType &res)
   * {
   *   res = y_dot;
   *   A.vmult_add(res, y);
   * };
   *
   * time_stepper.setup_jacobian = [&](const double ,
   *                                   const VectorType &, // y
   *                                   const VectorType &, // y_dot
   *                                   const double alpha)
   * {
   *   J = A;
   *
   *   J(0,0) += alpha;
   *   J(1,1) += alpha;
   *
   *   Jinv.invert(J);
   * };
   *

   * };
   *
   * y[1] = kappa;
   * y_dot[0] = kappa;
   * time_stepper.solve_dae(y,y_dot);
   * @endcode
   *
   *
   * <h3> A differential algebraic equation (DAE) example </h3>
   *
   * A more interesting example is a situation where the form $F(y', y, t) = 0$
   * provides something genuinely more flexible than a typical ordinary
   * differential equation. Specifically, consider the equation
   * @f{align*}{
   *   u'(t) &= av(t),
   *   \\
   *   0 &= v(t) - u(t).
   * @f}
   * One can combine the two variables into $y(t) = [u(t), v(t)]^T$.
   * Here, one of the two variables does not have a time derivative. In
   * applications, this is often the case when one variable evolves in
   * time (here, $u(t)$) on its own time scale, and the other one finds
   * its value as a function of the former on a much faster time scale.
   * In the current context, we could of course easily eliminate $v(t)$
   * using the second equation, and would then just be left with the
   * equation
   * @f[
   *   u'(t) = au(t)
   * @f]
   * which has solution $u(t) = u(0)e^{at}$. But this is, in general, not
   * easily possible if the two variables are related by differential
   * operators. In fact, this happens quite frequently in application. Take,
   * for example, the time-dependent Stokes equations:
   * @f{align*}{
   *   \frac{\partial \mathbf u(\mathbf x,t)}{\partial t}
   *   - \nu \Delta \mathbf u(\mathbf x,t) + \nabla p(\mathbf x,t)
   *   &= \mathbf f(\mathbf x,t),
   *   \\
   *   \nabla \cdot \mathbf u(\mathbf x,t) &= 0.
   * @f}
   * Here, the fluid velocity $\mathbf u(\mathbf x,t)$ evolves over time,
   * and the pressure is always in equilibrium with the flow because the Stokes
   * equations are derived under the assumption that the speed of sound (at
   * which pressure perturbations propagate) is much larger than the fluid
   * velocity. As a consequence, there is no time derivative on the pressure
   * available in the equation, but unlike the simple model problem above, the
   * pressure can not easily be eliminated from the system. Similar situations
   * happen in step-21, step-31, step-32, step-43, and others, where a subset of
   * variables is always in instantaneous equilibrium with another set of
   * variables that evolves on a slower time scale.
   *
   * Another case where we *could* eliminate a variable but do not want to
   * is where that additional variable is introduced in the first place to work
   * around some other problem. As an example, consider the time dependent
   * version of the biharmonic problem we consider in step-47 (as well as some
   * later ones). The equations we would then be interested in would read
   * @f{align*}{
   *   \frac{\partial u(\mathbf x,t)}{\partial t} + \Delta^2 u(\mathbf x,t) &=
   *   f(\mathbf x,t).
   * @f}
   * As discussed in step-47, the difficulty is the presence of the fourth
   * derivatives. One way in which one can address this is by introducing
   * an auxiliary variable $v=\Delta u$ which would render the problem into
   * the following one that only ever has second derivatives which we know
   * how to deal with:
   * @f{align*}{
   *   \frac{\partial u(\mathbf x,t)}{\partial t} + \Delta v(\mathbf x,t) &=
   *   f(\mathbf x,t),
   *   \\
   *   v(\mathbf x,t)-\Delta u(\mathbf x,t) &= 0.
   * @f}
   * Here, the introduction of the additional variable was voluntary, and
   * could be undone, but we don't want that of course. Rather, we end
   * up with a differential-algebraic equation because the equations do
   * not have a time derivative for $v$.
   *
   * Rather than show how to solve the trivial (linear) case above, let us
   * instead consider the situation where we introduce another variable $v$ that
   * is related to $u$ by the nonlinear relationship $v=u^p$, $p\ge 1$:
   * @f{align*}{
   *   u'(t) &= a v(t)^{1/p},
   *   \\
   *   0 &= v(t) - u(t)^p.
   * @f}
   * We will impose initial conditions as
   * @f{align*}{
   *   u(0) &= 1 \\
   *   v(0) &= 1.
   * @f}
   * The problem continues to have the solution $u(t)=e^{at}$ with the
   * auxiliary variable satisfying $v(t)=[e^{at}]^p$. One would implement
   * all of this using the following little program where you have to recall
   * that
   * @f[
   *   F = \begin{pmatrix}u' -a v^{1/p} \\ -u^p + v \end{pmatrix}
   * @f]
   * and that the Jacobian we need to provide is
   * @f[
   *   J(\alpha) =
   *   = \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial y} +
   *     \alpha \dfrac{\partial F}{\partial \dot y}
   *   = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha && -av^{1/p-1}/p \\ -pu^{p-1} & 1 \end{pmatrix}
   * @f]
   *
   * All of this can be implemented using the following code:
   * @code
   *   const double a = 1.0;
   *   const double p = 1.5;
   *
   *   using VectorType = Vector<double>;
   *
   *   VectorType         y(2);
   *   VectorType         y_dot(2);
   *   FullMatrix<double> J(2, 2);
   *   FullMatrix<double> A(2, 2);
   *   FullMatrix<double> Jinv(2, 2);
   *
   *   SUNDIALS::IDA<VectorVector> time_stepper;
   *
   *   time_stepper.reinit_vector = [&](VectorType &v) {
   *     v.reinit(2);
   *   };
   *
   *   time_stepper.residual = [&](const double      t,
   *                               const VectorType &y,

   *                               VectorType       &res) {
   *     //  F(Y', Y, t) = [x' -a y^{1/p} ; -x^p + y]
   *     res    = 0;
   *     res[0] = y_dot[0] - a * std::pow(y[1], 1./p);
   *     res[1] = -std::pow(y[0], p) + y[1];
   *   };

   *                                     const double alpha) {

   *     J(0, 0) = alpha;
   *     J(0, 1) = -a*std::pow(y[1], 1./p-1)/p;
   *     J(1, 0) = -p*std::pow(y[0], p-1);
   *     J(1, 1) = 1;
   *
   *     Jinv.invert(J);
   *   };
   *
   *   time_stepper.solve_with_jacobian =
   *     [&](const VectorType &src, VectorType &dst, const double) {
   *       Jinv.vmult(dst, src);
   *     };
   *
   *   // Provide initial values:
   *   y[0] = y[1] = 1;
   *   // Also provide initial derivatives. Note that
   *   //    v'(0) = d/dt[u^p](0) = p[u'(0)]^{p-1} = p a^{p-1}
   *   y_dot[0] = a;
   *   y_dot[1] = p*std::pow(a, p-1);
   *   time_stepper.solve_dae(y, y_dot);
   * @endcode
   * Note that in this code, we not only provide initial conditions for
   * $u$ and $v$, but also for $u'$ and $v'$. We can do this here because
   * we know what the exact solution is.
   *
   *
   * <h3> DAEs with missing initial conditions </h3>
   *
   * Whereas in the previous section, we were able to provide not only
   * initial values in the form of a vector for $y(0)$, but also for
   * $y'(0)$, this is not a common situation. For example, for the Stokes
   * equations mentioned above,
   * @f{align*}{
   *   \frac{\partial \mathbf u(\mathbf x,t)}{\partial t}
   *   - \nu \Delta \mathbf u(\mathbf x,t) + \nabla p(\mathbf x,t)
   *   &= \mathbf f(\mathbf x,t),
   *   \\
   *   \nabla \cdot \mathbf u(\mathbf x,t) &= 0,
   * @f}
   * one generally might have an initial velocity field for
   * $\mathbf u(\mathbf x,0)$, but typically one does not have an initial
   * pressure field $p(\mathbf x,0)$ nor either of these variables' time
   * derivatives at $t=0$.
   *
   * Fortunately, they can typically be computed via the relationship
   * $F(t,y,\dot y) = 0$. To illustrate how this can is done, let us
   * re-use the nonlinear example from the previous section:
   * @f{align*}{
   *   u'(t) &= a v(t)^{1/p},
   *   \\
   *   0 &= v(t) - u(t)^p.
   * @f}
   * If we now impose initial conditions for both variables, for
   * example
   * @f{align*}{
   *   u(0) &= 1 \\
   *   v(0) &= 1,
   * @f}
   * then the only change necessary is to create the time stepper via
   * @code
   *   SUNDIALS::IDA<VectorType>::AdditionalData data;
   *   data.ic_type = SUNDIALS::IDA<VectorType>::AdditionalData::use_y_diff;
   *   SUNDIALS::IDA<Vector<double>> time_stepper(data);
   * @endcode
   * and then we can run the program with the following at the end:
   * @code
   *   // Provide correct initial conditions y(0), but incorrect initial
   *   // derivatives y'(0):
   *   y[0] = y[1] = 1;  // correct
   *   y_dot[0]    = 0;  // wrong
   *   y_dot[1]    = 0;  // wrong
   *   time_stepper.solve_dae(y, y_dot);
   * @endcode
   * Here, IDA first compute $\dot y(0)$ before starting the time stepping
   * process.
   *
   * In many applications, however, one does not even have a complete set of
   * initial conditions -- e.g., in the Stokes equations above, one generally
   * only has initial values for the velocity, but not the pressure. IDA can
   * also compute these, but for that it needs to know which components of the
   * solution vector have differential equations attached to them -- i.e., for
   * which components a time derivative appears in $F(t,y,\dot y)$. This is
   * not difficult to do -- we only have to add the following block where a
   * lambda function returns an IndexSet that describes which variables
   * are "differential" (included in the index set) and which are not (not
   * included in the index set):
   * @code
   *     time_stepper.differential_components = []() {
   *     IndexSet x(2);
   *     x.add_index(0);
   *     return x;
   *   };
   *
   *   y[0]     = 1;   // correct
   *   y[1]     = 42;  // wrong
   *   y_dot[0] = 0;   // wrong
   *   y_dot[1] = 0;   // wrong
   *   time_stepper.solve_dae(y, y_dot);
   * @endcode
   * With these modifications, IDA correctly computes the solutions $u(t)$
   * and $v(t)$.
   *
   * A word of caution, however: All of this solving for components of
   * $y(0)$ and $y'(t)$ costs time and accuracy. If you *can* provide initial
   * conditions, you should; if you can't, they have to be numerically
   * approximated and will be close but not exact. In the examples above,
   * if all initial conditions $y(0),\dot y(0)$ are provided, IDA computes
   * the solution $y(10)=e^{10}\approx 22,000$ to an absolute accuracy of
   * around $3\cdot 10^{-5}$ (i.e., to a relative tolerance of better than
   * $10^{-8}$). If you only provide $y(0)$ correctly, the absolute error
   * is about twice as large, around $6\cdot 10^{-5}$. If one also omits
   * providing the initial value for the second component of $y(0)$ (the
   * non-differential component $v(0)$), the error goes up to $5\cdot 10^{-4}$.
   * That's not bad, but the trend is clear. In practice, one can control
   * the accuracy of the required solves for initial conditions by
   * setting the appropriate flags in the AdditionalData object passed to
   * the constructor.

     * parameters.
     *
     * IDA is a Differential Algebraic solver. As such, it requires initial
     * conditions also for the first order derivatives. If you do not provide
     * consistent initial conditions, (i.e., conditions for which F(y_dot(0),
     * y(0), 0) = 0), you can ask SUNDIALS to compute initial conditions for you
     * by using the `ic_type` parameter at construction time.
     *
     * You have three options
     * -  none: do not try to make initial conditions consistent.
     * -  use_y_diff: compute the algebraic components of y and differential
     *    components of y_dot, given the differential components of y.
     *    This option requires that the user specifies differential and
     *    algebraic components in the function differential_components().
     * -  use_y_dot: compute all components of y, given y_dot.
     *
     * By default, this class assumes that all components are differential, and
     * that you want to solve a standard ode. In this case, the initial
     * component type is set to `use_y_diff`, so that the `y_dot` at time
     * t=`initial_time` is computed by solving the nonlinear problem $F(y_dot,
     * y(t0), t0) = 0$ in the variable `y_dot`.
     *
     * Notice that a Newton solver is used for this computation. The Newton
     * solver parameters can be tweaked by acting on `ic_alpha` and
     * `ic_max_iter`.
     *
     * If you reset the solver at some point, you may want to select a different
     * computation for the initial conditions after reset. Say, for example,
     * that you have refined a grid, and after transferring the solution to the
     * new grid, the initial conditions are no longer consistent. Then you can
     * choose how these are made consistent, using the same three options that
     * you used for the initial conditions in `reset_type`.
