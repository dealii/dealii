  /**
   * Anytime a parallel::TriangulationBase is repartitioned, either upon request
   * or by refinement/coarsening, cells will be distributed amongst all
   * subdomains to achieve an equally balanced workload. If the workload per
   * cell varies, which is in general the case for DoFHandler objects with
   * hp-capabilities, we can take that into account by introducing individual
   * weights for different cells.
   *
   * This class allows computing these weights for load balancing by
   * consulting the FiniteElement that is associated with each cell of
   * a DoFHandler. One can choose from predefined weighting algorithms provided
   * by this class or provide a custom one.
   *
   * If the associated DoFHandler has not been initialized yet, i.e., its
   * hp::FECollection is empty, all cell weights will be evaluated as zero.
   *
   * This class offers two different ways of connecting the chosen weighting
   * function to the corresponding signal of the linked
   * parallel::TriangulationBase. The recommended way involves creating an
   * object of this class which will automatically take care of registering the
   * weighting function upon creation and de-registering it once destroyed. An
   * object of this class needs to exist for every DoFHandler associated with
   * the Triangulation we work on to achieve satisfying work balancing results.
   * The connected weighting function may be changed anytime using the
   * CellWeights::reinit() function. The following code snippet demonstrates how
   * to achieve each cell being weighted by its current number of degrees of
   * freedom. We chose a factor of `1000` that corresponds to the initial weight
   * each cell is assigned to upon creation.
   * @code
   * parallel::CellWeights<dim, spacedim> cell_weights(
   *   hp_dof_handler,
   *   parallel::CellWeights<dim, spacedim>::ndofs_weighting({1000, 1}));
   * @endcode
   *
   * On the other hand, you are also able to take care of handling the signal
   * connection manually by using the static member function of this class. In
   * this case, an analogous code example looks as follows.
   * @code
   * boost::signals2::connection connection =
   *   hp_dof_handler.get_triangulation().signals.cell_weight.connect(
   *     parallel::CellWeights<dim, spacedim>::make_weighting_callback(
   *       hp_dof_handler,
   *       parallel::CellWeights<dim, spacedim>::ndofs_weighting(
   *         {1000, 1}));
   * @endcode
   *
   * @note See Triangulation::Signals::cell_weight for more information on
   * weighting and load balancing.
   *
   * @note Be aware that this class connects the weight function to the
   * Triangulation during this class's constructor. If the Triangulation
   * associated with the DoFHandler changes during the lifetime of the
   * latter via DoFHandler::reinit(), an assertion will be triggered in
   * the weight_callback() function. Use CellWeights::reinit() to deregister the
   * weighting function on the old Triangulation and connect it to the new one.
   *
   * @ingroup distributed
