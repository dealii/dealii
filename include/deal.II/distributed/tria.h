     * This class acts like the dealii::Triangulation class, but it
     * distributes the mesh across a number of different processors when using
     * MPI. The class's interface does not add a lot to the
     * dealii::Triangulation class but there are a number of difficult
     * algorithms under the hood that ensure we always have a load-balanced,
     * fully distributed mesh. Use of this class is explained in step-40,
     * step-32, the
     * @ref distributed
     * documentation module, as well as the
     * @ref distributed_paper.
     * See there for more information. This class satisfies the
     * @ref ConceptMeshType "MeshType concept".
     *
     * @note This class does not support anisotropic refinement, because it
     * relies on the p4est library that does not support this. Attempts to
     * refine cells anisotropically will result in errors.
     *
     * @note There is currently no support for distributing 1d triangulations.
     *
     *
     * <h3> Interaction with boundary description </h3>
     *
     * Refining and coarsening a distributed triangulation is a complicated
     * process because cells may have to be migrated from one processor to
     * another. On a single processor, materializing that part of the global
     * mesh that we want to store here from what we have stored before
     * therefore may involve several cycles of refining and coarsening the
     * locally stored set of cells until we have finally gotten from the
     * previous to the next triangulation. This process is described in more
     * detail in the
     * @ref distributed_paper.
     * Unfortunately, in this process, some information can get lost relating
     * to flags that are set by user code and that are inherited from mother
     * to child cell but that are not moved along with a cell if that cell is
     * migrated from one processor to another.
     *
     * An example are boundary indicators. Assume, for example, that you start
     * with a single cell that is refined once globally, yielding four
     * children. If you have four processors, each one owns one cell. Assume
     * now that processor 1 sets the boundary indicators of the external
     * boundaries of the cell it owns to 42. Since processor 0 does not own
     * this cell, it doesn't set the boundary indicators of its ghost cell
     * copy of this cell. Now, assume we do several mesh refinement cycles and
     * end up with a configuration where this processor suddenly finds itself
     * as the owner of this cell. If boundary indicator 42 means that we need
     * to integrate Neumann boundary conditions along this boundary, then
     * processor 0 will forget to do so because it has never set the boundary
     * indicator along this cell's boundary to 42.
     *
     * The way to avoid this dilemma is to make sure that things like setting
     * boundary indicators or material ids is done immediately every time a
     * parallel triangulation is refined. This is not necessary for sequential
     * triangulations because, there, these flags are inherited from mother to
     * child cell and remain with a cell even if it is refined and the
     * children are later coarsened again, but this does not hold for
     * distributed triangulations. It is made even more difficult by the fact
     * that in the process of refining a parallel distributed triangulation,
     * the triangulation may call
     * dealii::Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement multiple times
     * and this function needs to know about boundaries. In other words, it is
     * <i>not</i> enough to just set boundary indicators on newly created
     * faces only <i>after</i> calling
     * <tt>distributed::parallel::TriangulationBase::execute_coarsening_and_refinement</tt>:
     * it actually has to happen while that function is still running.
     *
     * The way to do this is by writing a function that sets boundary
     * indicators and that will be called by the dealii::Triangulation class.
     * The triangulation does not provide a pointer to itself to the function
     * being called, nor any other information, so the trick is to get this
     * information into the function. C++ provides a nice mechanism for this
     * that is best explained using an example:
     * @code
     * #include <functional>
     *
     * template <int dim>
     * void set_boundary_ids (
     *   parallel::distributed::Triangulation<dim> &triangulation)
     * {
     *   ... set boundary indicators on the triangulation object ...
     * }
     *
     * template <int dim>
     * void
     * MyClass<dim>::create_coarse_mesh (
     *   parallel::distributed::Triangulation<dim> &coarse_grid) const
     * {
     *   ... create the coarse mesh ...
     *
     *   coarse_grid.signals.post_refinement.connect(
     *     [&coarse_grid](){
     *       set_boundary_ids<dim>(coarse_grid);
     *     });
     * }
     * @endcode
     *
     * The object passed as argument to <code>connect</code> is an object
     * that can be called like a function with no arguments. It does so by
     * wrapping a function that does, in fact, take an argument but this one
     * argument is stored as a reference to the coarse grid triangulation when
     * the lambda function is created. After each refinement step, the
     * triangulation will then call the object so created which will in turn
     * call <code>set_boundary_ids<dim></code> with the reference to the coarse
     * grid as argument.
     *
     * This approach can be generalized. In the example above, we have used a
     * global function that will be called. However, sometimes it is necessary
     * that this function is in fact a member function of the class that
     * generates the mesh, for example because it needs to access run-time
     * parameters. This can be achieved as follows: assuming the
     * <code>set_boundary_ids()</code> function has been declared as a (non-
     * static, but possibly private) member function of the
     * <code>MyClass</code> class, then the following will work:
     * @code
     * #include <functional>
     *
     * template <int dim>
     * void
     * MyClass<dim>::set_boundary_ids (
     *   parallel::distributed::Triangulation<dim> &triangulation) const
     * {
     *   ... set boundary indicators on the triangulation object ...
     * }
     *
     * template <int dim>
     * void
     * MyClass<dim>::create_coarse_mesh (
     *   parallel::distributed::Triangulation<dim> &coarse_grid) const
     * {
     *   ... create the coarse mesh ...
     *
     *   coarse_grid.signals.post_refinement.connect(
     *     [this, &coarse_grid]()
     *     {
     *       this->set_boundary_ids(coarse_grid);
     *     });
     * }
     * @endcode
     * The lambda function above again is an object that can
     * be called like a global function with no arguments, and this object in
     * turn calls the current object's member function
     * <code>set_boundary_ids</code> with a reference to the triangulation to
     * work on. Note that
     * because the <code>create_coarse_mesh</code> function is declared as
     * <code>const</code>, it is necessary that the
     * <code>set_boundary_ids</code> function is also declared
     * <code>const</code>.
     *
     * <b>Note:</b>For reasons that have to do with the way the
     * parallel::distributed::Triangulation is implemented, functions that
     * have been attached to the post-refinement signal of the triangulation
     * are called more than once, sometimes several times, every time the
     * triangulation is actually refined.
