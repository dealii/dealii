    /**
     * Transfer a discrete FE function (like a solution vector) by
     * interpolation while refining and/or coarsening a distributed grid and
     * handles the necessary communication.
     *
     * @note It is important to note, that if you use more than one
     * SolutionTransfer object at the same time, that the calls to prepare_*()
     * and interpolate()/deserialize() need to be in the same order.
     *
     * <h3>Note on ghost elements</h3> In a parallel computation PETSc or
     * Trilinos vector may contain ghost elements or not. For reading in
     * information with prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement() or
     * prepare_for_serialization() you need to supply vectors with ghost
     * elements, so that all locally_active elements can be read. On the other
     * hand, ghosted vectors are generally not writable, so for calls to
     * interpolate() or deserialize() you need to supply distributed vectors
     * without ghost elements. More precisely, during interpolation the
     * current algorithm writes into all locally active degrees of freedom.
     *
     * <h3>Transferring a solution</h3> Here VectorType is your favorite
     * vector type, e.g. PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector,
     * TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector, or corresponding block vectors.
     * @code
     * SolutionTransfer<dim, VectorType> soltrans(dof_handler);
     * // flag some cells for refinement and coarsening, e.g.
     * GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction(tria,
     *                                                   error_indicators,
     *                                                   0.3,
     *                                                   0.05);
     *
     * // prepare the triangulation,
     * tria.prepare_coarsening_and_refinement();
     *
     * // prepare the SolutionTransfer object for coarsening and refinement
     * // and give the solution vector that we intend to interpolate later,
     * soltrans.prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(solution);
     *
     * // actually execute the refinement,
     * tria.execute_coarsening_and_refinement ();
     *
     * // redistribute dofs,
     * dof_handler.distribute_dofs (fe);
     *
     * // and interpolate the solution
     * VectorType interpolated_solution;
     *
     * //create VectorType in the right size here
     * soltrans.interpolate(interpolated_solution);
     * @endcode
     *
     * As the grid is distributed, it is important to note that the old
     * solution(s) must be copied to one that also provides access to the
     * locally relevant DoF values (these values required for the interpolation
     * process):
     * @code
     * // Create initial indexsets pertaining to the grid before refinement
     * IndexSet locally_owned_dofs, locally_relevant_dofs;
     * locally_owned_dofs = dof_handler.locally_owned_dofs();
     * DoFTools::extract_locally_relevant_dofs(dof_handler,
     * locally_relevant_dofs);
     *
     * // The solution vector only knows about locally owned DoFs
     * TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector solution;
     * solution.reinit(locally_owned_dofs,
     *                 mpi_communicator);
     * ...
     * // Transfer solution to vector that provides access to
     * // locally relevant DoFs
     * TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector old_solution;
     * old_solution.reinit(locally_owned_dofs,
     *                     locally_relevant_dofs,
     *                     mpi_communicator);
     * old_solution = solution;
     *
     * // Initialize SolutionTransfer object
     * SolutionTransfer<dim, VectorType> soltrans(dof_handler);
     * soltrans.prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(old_solution);
     * ...
     * // Refine grid
     * // Recreate locally_owned_dofs and locally_relevant_dofs index sets
     * ...
     * solution.reinit(locally_owned_dofs, mpi_communicator);
     * soltrans.interpolate(solution);
     * @endcode
     *
     * Different from PETSc and Trilinos vectors,
     * LinearAlgebra::distributed::Vector allows writing into ghost elements.
     * For a ghosted vector the interpolation step can be accomplished via
     * @code
     * interpolated_solution.zero_out_ghost_values();
     * soltrans.interpolate(interpolated_solution);
     * interpolated_solution.update_ghost_values();
     * @endcode
     *
     * <h3>Use for Serialization</h3>
     *
     * This class can be used to serialize and later deserialize a distributed
     * mesh with solution vectors to a file. If you use more than one
     * DoFHandler and therefore more than one SolutionTransfer object, they
     * need to be serialized and deserialized in the same order.
     *
     * If vector has the locally relevant DoFs, serialization works as
     * follows:
     * @code
     * parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer<dim,VectorType>
     *   sol_trans(dof_handler);
     * sol_trans.prepare_for_serialization (vector);
     *
     * triangulation.save(filename);
     * @endcode
     * For deserialization the vector needs to be a distributed vector
     * (without ghost elements):
     * @code
     * //[create coarse mesh...]
     * triangulation.load(filename);
     *
     * parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer<dim,VectorType>
     *   sol_trans(dof_handler);
     * sol_trans.deserialize (distributed_vector);
     * @endcode
     *
     *
     * <h3>Note on usage with DoFHandler with hp-capabilities</h3>
     *
     * Since data on DoFHandler objects with hp-capabilities is associated with
     * many different FiniteElement objects, each cell's data has to be
     * processed with its corresponding `future_fe_index`. Further, if
     * refinement is involved, data will be packed on the parent cell with its
     * `future_fe_index` and unpacked later with the same index on its children.
     * If cells get coarsened into one, data will be packed on the children with
     * the least dominant finite element of their common subspace, and unpacked
     * on the parent with this particular finite element (consult
     * hp::FECollection::find_dominated_fe_extended() for more information).
     *
     * Transferring a solution across refinement works exactly like in the
     * non-hp-case. However, when considering serialization, we also have to
     * store the active FE indices in an additional step. A code snippet
     * demonstrating serialization with the
     * parallel::distributed::SolutionTransfer class with DoFHandler objects
     * with hp-capabilities is provided in the following. Here VectorType is
     * your favorite vector type, e.g. PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector,
     * TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector, or corresponding block vectors.
     *
     * If vector has the locally relevant DoFs, serialization works as follows:
     * @code
     * parallel::distributed::
     *   SolutionTransfer<dim, VectorType, DoFHandler<dim,spacedim>>
     *     sol_trans(hp_dof_handler);
     *
     * hp_dof_handler.prepare_for_serialization_of_active_fe_indices();
     * sol_trans.prepare_for_serialization(vector);
     *
     * triangulation.save(filename);
     * @endcode
     *
     * For deserialization the vector needs to be a distributed vector
     * (without ghost elements):
     * @code
     * //[create coarse mesh...]
     * triangulation.load(filename);
     *
     * hp::FECollection<dim,spacedim> fe_collection;
     * //[prepare identical fe_collection...]
     *
     * DoFHandler<dim,spacedim> hp_dof_handler(triangulation);
     * // We need to introduce our dof_handler to the fe_collection
     * // before setting all active FE indices.
     * hp_dof_handler.deserialize_active_fe_indices();
     * hp_dof_handler.distribute_dofs(fe_collection);
     *
     * parallel::distributed::
     *   SolutionTransfer<dim,VectorType,DoFHandler<dim,spacedim>>
     *     sol_trans(hp_dof_handler);
     * sol_trans.deserialize(distributed_vector);
     * @endcode
     *
     *
     * <h3>Interaction with hanging nodes</h3>
     *
     * In essence, this class implements the same steps as does
     * dealii::SolutionTransfer (though the implementation is entirely
     * separate). Consequently, the same issue with hanging nodes and
     * coarsening can happen with this class as happens with
     * dealii::SolutionTransfer. See there for an extended discussion.
