  /**
   * This class defines a quadrature formula for integration over an
   * oriented surface, $\hat{S}$, immersed in the unit cell. By
   * immersed it is meant that the surface may intersect the unit cell
   * in an arbitrary way. The quadrature formula is described by a set
   * of quadrature points, $\hat{x}_q$, weights, $w_q$, and normalized
   * surface normals, $\hat{n}_q$.
   *
   * We typically want to compute surface integrals in real space.
   * A surface $S$ intersecting a cell $K$ in real space, can be mapped onto a
   * surface $\hat{S}$ intersecting the unit cell $\hat{K}$.
   * Thus a surface integral over $S\cap K$ in real space can be transformed to
   * a surface integral over $\hat{S} \cap \hat{K}$ according to
   * @f[
   * \int_{S\cap K} f(x) dS =
   * \int_{S\cap K} f(x) |d\bar{S}| =
   * \int_{\hat{S}\cap\hat{K}} f(F_{K}(\hat{x})) \det(J) |\left( J^{-1} \right
   * )^T d\hat{S}|,
   * @f]
   * where $F_K$ is the mapping from reference to real space and $J$ is its
   * Jacobian. This transformation is possible since the continuous surface
   * elements are vectors: $d\bar{S}, d\hat{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{dim}$ which are
   * parallel to the normals of $S$ and $\hat{S}$. So in order to compute the
   * integral in real space one needs information about the normal to do the
   * transformation.
   *
   * Thus, in addition to storing points and weights, this quadrature stores
   * also the normalized normal for each quadrature point. This can be viewed
   * as storing a discrete surface element,
   * @f[
   * \Delta \hat{S}_q \dealcoloneq w_q \hat{n}_q \approx d\hat{S}(\hat{x}_q),
   * @f]
   * for each quadrature point. The surface integral in real space would then be
   * approximated as
   * @f[
   * \int_{S\cap K} f(x) dS \approx
   * \sum_{q} f \left(F_{K}(\hat{x}_{q}) \right) \det(J_q)
   * |\left( J_q^{-1} \right)^T \hat{n}_q| w_q.
   * @f]
