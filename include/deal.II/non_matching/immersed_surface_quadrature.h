  /**
   * This class defines a quadrature formula to integrate over the intersection
   * between an oriented surface, $\hat{S}$, and a cell or face. The word
   * "immersed" in the class name reflects that the surface may intersect the
   * cell/face in an arbitrary way.
   *
   * The spacedim template parameter of this class is the dimension that the
   * (spacedim-1)-dimensional surface is embedded in:
   * $\hat{S} \subset \mathbb{R}^{\text{spacedim}}$. The dim parameter
   * describes the dimension of the "object" that the surface intersects. That
   * is, dim = spacedim corresponds to the surface intersecting a cell and
   * dim = spacedim - 1 corresponds to the surface intersecting a face. The
   * quadrature formula is described by a set of quadrature points,
   * $\hat{x}_q \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{dim}}$, weights, $w_q$, and normalized
   * surface normals, $\hat{n}_q \in \mathbb{R}^{\text{spacedim}}$.
   *
   * Consider first the case dim = spacedim. We typically want to compute
   * integrals in real space. A surface, $S$, intersecting a cell, $K$, in
   * real space can be mapped onto a surface, $\hat{S}$, intersecting the unit
   * cell, $\hat{K}$. Thus an integral over $S\cap K$ in real space can be
   * transformed to an integral over $\hat{S} \cap \hat{K}$ according to
   * @f[
   * \int_{S\cap K} f dS =
   * \int_{S\cap K} f |d\bar{S}| =
   * \int_{\hat{S}\cap\hat{K}} f \circ F_{K} \det(J) |\left( J^{-1} \right
   * )^T d\hat{S}|,
   * @f]
   * where $F_K$ is the mapping from reference to real space and $J$ is its
   * Jacobian matrix. This transformation is possible since the continuous
   * surface elements are vectors:
   * $d\bar{S}, d\hat{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{spacedim}$, which are parallel to the
   * normals of $S$ and $\hat{S}$. That is, the normal is needed to do the
   * transformation. Thus, in addition to storing points and weights, this
   * quadrature stores also the normalized normal for each quadrature point.
   * This can be viewed as storing a discrete surface element,
   * @f[
   * \Delta \hat{S}_q \dealcoloneq w_q \hat{n}_q \approx d\hat{S}(\hat{x}_q),
   * @f]
   * for each quadrature point. The surface integral in real space would then be
   * approximated as
   * @f[
   * \int_{S\cap K} f dS \approx
   * \sum_{q} f \left(F_{K}(\hat{x}_{q}) \right) \det(J_q)
   * |\left( J_q^{-1} \right)^T \hat{n}_q| w_q.
   * @f]
   *
   * @image html immersed_surface_quadrature.svg
   *
   * When dim = spacedim - 1, this class represents a (spacedim-2)-dimensional
   * integral. That is, if spacedim = 3 we have a line integral immersed in a
   * face. Let $\hat{r}(t)$, $t \in [0,T]$ be an arc-length parameterizations of
   * $\hat{F}\cap \hat{S}$, i.e., the part of the surface that intersects the
   * face in reference space. This means that $\bar{r}(t) = F_K(\hat{r}(t))$ is
   * a parameterization of $S\cap F$. The transformation of the line integral
   * now reads
   * @f[
   * \int_{S\cap F} f dr
   * = \int_{0}^T f(\bar{r}(t)) \left \|\frac{d\bar{r}}{dt} \right \| dt
   * = \int_{0}^T f(F_K(\hat{r}(t))) \left \| J \frac{d\hat{r}}{dt} \right \| dt
   * \approx \sum_{q} f \left(F_{K}(\hat{x}_{q}) \right) \|J(\hat{x}_q)
   * \hat{t}_q \| w_q,
   * @f]
   * where $\hat{t}_q = \frac{d\hat{r}}{dt}(x_q) $ is the tangent to the curve
   * at $\hat{x}_q$. This tangent can also be computed as
   * $t_q = \hat{n}_q \times \hat{n}_F / \| \hat{n}_q \times \hat{n}_F \|$ where
   * $\hat{n}_F$ is the face normal. It would be possible to compute the tangent
   * by only knowing the normal to the curve in the face plane (i.e. the
   * dim-dimensional normal). However, when these quadratures are used, the weak
   * form typically involves the so-called conormal, which can not be computed
   * without knowing the surface normal in
   * $\mathbb{R}^{\text{spacedim}}$. The conormal is the unit vector parallel to
   * the projection of the face normal into the surface plane. This is the same
   * as the normalized
   * @ref GlossBoundaryForm "boundary form".
