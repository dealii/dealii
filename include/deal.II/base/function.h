/**
 * This class is a model for a general function that, given a point at which
 * to evaluate the function, returns a vector of values with one or more
 * components.
 *
 * The class serves the purpose of representing both scalar and vector valued
 * functions. To this end, we consider scalar functions as a special case of
 * vector valued functions, in the former case only having a single component
 * return vector. Since handling vectors is comparatively expensive, the
 * interface of this class has functions which only ask for a single component
 * of the vector-valued results (this is what you will usually need in case
 * you know that your function is scalar-valued) as well as functions you can
 * ask for an entire vector of results with as many components as the function
 * object represents. Access to function objects therefore is through the
 * following methods:
 * @code
 *   // access to one component at one point
 *   double value        (const Point<dim>   &p,
 *                        const unsigned int  component = 0) const;
 *
 *   // return all components at one point
 *   void   vector_value (const Point<dim>   &p,
 *                        Vector<double>     &value) const;
 * @endcode
 *
 * For more efficiency, there are other functions returning one or all
 * components at a list of points at once:
 * @code
 *   // access to one component at several points
 *   void   value_list (const std::vector<Point<dim> >  &point_list,
 *                      std::vector<double>             &value_list,
 *                      const unsigned int  component = 0) const;
 *
 *   // return all components at several points
 *   void   vector_value_list (const std::vector<Point<dim> >    &point_list,
 *                             std::vector<Vector<double> >      &value_list) const;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Furthermore, there are functions returning the gradient of the function or
 * even higher derivatives at one or several points.
 *
 * You will usually only overload those functions you need; the functions
 * returning several values at a time (value_list(), vector_value_list(), and
 * gradient analogs) will call those returning only one value (value(),
 * vector_value(), and gradient analogs), while those ones will throw an
 * exception when called but not overloaded.
 *
 * Conversely, the functions returning all components of the function at one
 * or several points (i.e. vector_value(), vector_value_list()), will
 * <em>not</em> call the function returning one component at one point
 * repeatedly, once for each point and component. The reason is efficiency:
 * this would amount to too many virtual function calls. If you have vector-
 * valued functions, you should therefore also provide overloads of the
 * virtual functions for all components at a time.
 *
 * Also note, that unless only called a very small number of times, you should
 * overload all sets of functions (returning only one value, as well as those
 * returning a whole array), since the cost of evaluation of a point value is
 * often less than the virtual function call itself.
 *
 * Support for time dependent functions can be found in the base class
 * FunctionTime.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Functions that return tensors</h3>
 *
 * If the functions you are dealing with have a number of components that are
 * a priori known (for example, <tt>dim</tt> elements), you might consider
 * using the TensorFunction class instead. This is, in particular, true if the
 * objects you return have the properties of a tensor, i.e., they are for
 * example dim-dimensional vectors or dim-by-dim matrices. On the other hand,
 * functions like VectorTools::interpolate or
 * VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values definitely only want objects of
 * the current type. You can use the VectorFunctionFromTensorFunction class to
 * convert the former to the latter.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Functions that return different fields</h3>
 *
 * Most of the time, your functions will have the form $f : \Omega \rightarrow
 * {\mathbb R}^{n_\text{components}}$. However, there are occasions where you
 * want the function to return vectors (or scalars) over a different number
 * field, for example functions that return complex numbers or vectors of
 * complex numbers: $f : \Omega \rightarrow {\mathbb
 * C}^{n_\text{components}}$. In such cases, you can use the second template
 * argument of this class: it describes the scalar type to be used for each
 * component of your return values. It defaults to @p double, but in the
 * example above, it could be set to <code>std::complex@<double@></code>.

/**
 * This class provides a way to convert a scalar function of the kind
 * @code
 *   Number foo (const Point<dim> &);
 * @endcode
 * into an object of type Function@<dim@>. Since the argument returns a
 * scalar, the result is clearly a Function object for which
 * <code>function.n_components==1</code>. The class works by storing a pointer
 * to the given function and every time
 * <code>function.value(p,component)</code> is called, calls
 * <code>foo(p)</code> and returns the corresponding value. It also makes sure
 * that <code>component</code> is in fact zero, as needs be for scalar
 * functions.
 *
 * The class provides an easy way to turn a simple global function into
 * something that has the required Function@<dim@> interface for operations
 * like VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values() etc., and thereby allows
 * for simpler experimenting without having to write all the boiler plate code
 * of declaring a class that is derived from Function and implementing the
 * Function::value() function. An example of this is given in the results
 * section of step-53.
 *
 * The class gains additional expressive power because the argument it takes
 * does not have to be a pointer to an actual function. Rather, it is a
 * function object, i.e., it can also be the result of call to std::bind (or
 * boost::bind) or some other object that can be called with a single
 * argument. For example, if you need a Function object that returns the norm
 * of a point, you could write it like so:
 * @code
 *   template <int dim, typename Number>
 *   class Norm : public Function<dim, Number> {
 *     public:
 *       virtual Number value (const Point<dim> &p,
 *                             const unsigned int component) const {
 *         Assert (component == 0, ExcMessage ("This object is scalar!"));
 *         return p.norm();
 *       }
 *    };
 *
 *    Norm<2> my_norm_object;
 * @endcode
 * and then pass the <code>my_norm_object</code> around, or you could write it
 * like so:
 * @code
 *   ScalarFunctionFromFunctionObject<dim, Number> my_norm_object (&Point<dim>::norm);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Similarly, to generate an object that computes the distance to a point
 * <code>q</code>, we could do this:
 * @code
 *   template <int dim, typename Number>
 *   class DistanceTo : public Function<dim, Number> {

/**
 * This class is similar to the ScalarFunctionFromFunctionObject class in that
 * it allows for the easy conversion of a function object to something that
 * satisfies the interface of the Function base class. The difference is that
 * here, the given function object is still a scalar function (i.e. it has a
 * single value at each space point) but that the Function object generated is
 * vector valued. The number of vector components is specified in the
 * constructor, where one also selectes a single one of these vector
 * components that should be filled by the passed object. The result is a
 * vector Function object that returns zero in each component except the
 * single selected one where it returns the value returned by the given as the
 * first argument to the constructor.
 *
 * @note In the above discussion, note the difference between the (scalar)
 * "function object" (i.e., a C++ object <code>x</code> that can be called as
 * in <code>x(p)</code>) and the capitalized (vector valued) "Function object"
 * (i.e., an object of a class that is derived from the Function base class).
 *
 * To be more concrete, let us consider the following example:
 * @code
 *   Number one (const Point<2> &p) { return 1; }
 *   VectorFunctionFromScalarFunctionObject<2>
 *      component_mask (&one, 1, 3);
 * @endcode
 * Here, <code>component_mask</code> then represents a Function object that
 * for every point returns the vector $(0, 1, 0)^T$, i.e. a mask function that
 * could, for example, be passed to VectorTools::integrate_difference(). This
 * effect can also be achieved using the ComponentSelectFunction class but is
 * obviously easily extended to functions that are non-constant in their one
 * component.

 * This class is built as a means of translating the <code>Tensor<1,dim,

 * returning them as a multiple component version of the same thing as a
 * Vector for use in, for example, the VectorTools::interpolate or the many
 * other functions taking Function objects. It allows the user to place the
 * desired components into an <tt>n_components</tt> long vector starting at
 * the <tt>selected_component</tt> location in that vector and have all other
 * components be 0.
 *
 * For example: Say you created a class called
 *  @code
 *    class RightHandSide : public TensorFunction<rank,dim, Number>
 *  @endcode
 * which extends the TensorFunction class and you have an object
 *  @code
 *    RightHandSide<1,dim, Number> rhs;
 *  @endcode
 * of that class which you want to interpolate onto your mesh using the
 * VectorTools::interpolate function, but the finite element you use for the
 * DoFHandler object has 3 copies of a finite element with <tt>dim</tt>
 * components, for a total of 3*dim components. To interpolate onto that
 * DoFHandler, you need an object of type Function that has 3*dim vector
 * components. Creating such an object from the existing <code>rhs</code>
 * object is done using this piece of code:
 *  @code
 *      RighHandSide<1,dim, Number> rhs;
 *      VectorFunctionFromTensorFunction<dim, Number> rhs_vector_function (rhs, 0, 3*dim);
 *  @endcode
 * where the <code>dim</code> components of the tensor function are placed
 * into the first <code>dim</code> components of the function object.
