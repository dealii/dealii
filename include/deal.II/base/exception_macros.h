/**
 * `DEAL_II_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` is a macro (that looks like a function call
 * when used as in `DEAL_II_NOT_IMPLEMENTED();`) that is used to raise an
 * error in places where a piece of code is not yet implemented. If a code
 * runs into such a place, it will be aborted with an error message that
 * explains the situation, along with a backtrace of how the code ended
 * up in this place. Alternatively, if
 * deal_II_exceptions::internals::ExceptionHandling::abort_or_throw_on_exception
 * is set to ExceptionHandling::throw_on_exception, then the corresponding
 * error is thrown as a C++ exception that can be caught (though in
 * many cases codes will then find it difficult to do what they wanted
 * to do).
 *
 * This macro is first used in step-8 of the tutorial.
 *
 * A typical case where it is used would look as follows: Assume that we want
 * to implement a function that describes the right hand side of an equation
 * that corresponds to a known solution (i.e., we want to use the "Method
 * of manufactured solutions", see step-7). We have computed the right
 * hand side that corresponds to the 1d and 2d solutions, but we have been
 * too lazy so far to do the calculations for the 3d case, perhaps because
 * we first want to test correctness in 1d and 2d before moving on to the 3d
 * case. We could then write this right hand side as follows (the specific
 * formulas in the `return` statements are not important):
 * @code
 *   template <int dim>
 *   double right_hand_side (const Point<dim> &x)
 *   {
 *     if (dim==1)
 *       return x[0]*std::sin(x[0]);
 *     else if (dim==2)
 *       return x[0]*std::sin(x[0])*std::sin(x[1];
 *     else
 *       DEAL_II_NOT_IMPLEMENTED();
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * Here, the call to `DEAL_II_NOT_IMPLEMENTED()` simply indicates that we
 * haven't gotten around to filling in this code block. If someone ends up
 * running the program in 3d, execution will abort in the location with an
 * error message that indicates where this happened and why.

/**
 * `DEAL_II_ASSERT_UNREACHABLE` is a macro (that looks like a function call
 * when used as in `DEAL_II_ASSERT_UNREACHABLE();`) that is used to raise an
 * error in places where the programmer believed that execution should
 * never get to. If a code
 * runs into such a place, it will be aborted with an error message that
 * explains the situation, along with a backtrace of how the code ended
 * up in this place. Alternatively, if
 * deal_II_exceptions::internals::ExceptionHandling::abort_or_throw_on_exception
 * is set to ExceptionHandling::throw_on_exception, then the corresponding
 * error is thrown as a C++ exception that can be caught (though in
 * many cases codes will then find it difficult to do what they wanted
 * to do).
 *
 * A typical case where it is used would look as follows. In many cases,
 * one has a finite enumeration of things that can happen, and one runs
 * through those in a sequence of `if`-`else` blocks, or perhaps
 * with a `switch` selection and a number of `case` statements. Of
 * course, if the code is correct, if all possible cases are handled,
 * nothing terrible can happen -- though perhaps it is worth making sure
 * that we have really covered all cases by using `DEAL_II_ASSERT_UNREACHABLE()`
 * as the *last* case. Here is an example:
 * @code
 *   enum OutputFormat { vtk, vtu };
 *
 *   void write_output (const OutputFormat format)
 *   {
 *     if (format == vtk)
 *       {
 *         ... write in VTK format ...
 *       }
 *     else // must not clearly be VTU format
 *       {
 *         ... write in VTU format ...
 *       }
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * The issue here is "Are we really sure it is VTU format if we end up in
 * the `else` block"? There are two reasons that should make us suspicious.
 * First, the authors of the code may later have expanded the list of options
 * in the `OutputFormat` enum, but forgotten to also update the
 * `write_output()` function. We may then end up in the `else` branch even
 * though the argument indicates the now possible third option that was added
 * to `OutputFormat`. The second possibility to consider is that enums are
 * really just fancy ways of using integers; from a language perspective, it
 * is allowed to pass *any* integer to `write_output()`, even values that do
 * not match either `vtk` or `vtu`. This is then clearly a bug in the program,
 * but one that we are better off if we catch it as early as possible.
 *
 * We can guard against both cases by writing the code as follows instead:
 * @code
 *   enum OutputFormat { vtk, vtu };
 *
 *   void write_output (const OutputFormat format)
 *   {
 *     if (format == vtk)
 *       {
 *         ... write in VTK format ...
 *       }
 *     else if (format == vtu)
 *       {
 *         ... write in VTU format ...
 *       }
 *     else // we shouldn't get here, but if we did, abort the program now!
 *       DEAL_II_ASSERT_UNREACHABLE();
 *   }
 * @endcode
 *
 * This macro is first used in step-7, where we show another example of
 * a context where it is frequently used.
