/**
 * Class implementing the integrated Legendre polynomials described in the PhD
 * thesis of Sabine Zaglmayr.
 *
 * This class was written based upon the existing deal.II Legendre class as a
 * base, but with the coefficients adjusted so that the recursive formula is for
 * the integrated Legendre polynomials described in the PhD thesis of Sabine
 * Zaglmayr. The polynomials can be generated recursively from:
 *
 * - $L_{0}(x) = -1$ (added so that it can be generated recursively from 0)
 * - $L_{1}(x) = x$
 * - $L_{2}(x) = \frac{(x^2 - 1)}{2}$
 * - $(n+1)L_{n+1} = (2n-1)L_{n} - (n-2)L_{n-1}$.
 *
 * However, it is also possible to generate them directly from the Legendre
 * polynomials:
 *
 * $L_{n} = \frac{l_{n} - l_{n-2}}{2n-1)}$
