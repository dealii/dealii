/**
 * The ConvergenceTable class is an application to the TableHandler class and
 * stores some convergence data, such as residuals of the cg-method, or some
 * evaluated <i>L<sup>2</sup></i>-errors of discrete solutions, etc, and
 * evaluates convergence rates or orders.
 *
 * The already implemented #RateMode's are #reduction_rate, where the
 * convergence rate is the quotient of two following rows, and
 * #reduction_rate_log2, that evaluates the order of convergence. These
 * standard evaluations are useful for global refinement, for local refinement
 * this may not be an appropriate method, as the convergence rates should be
 * set in relation to the number of cells or the number of DoFs. The
 * implementations of these non-standard methods is left to a user.
 *
 * The number of cells and the number of DoFs may be added to the table by
 * calling e.g.  <tt>add_value("n cells", n_cells)</tt>. The table data is
 * also added by calling add_value().  Before the output of the table the
 * functions evaluate_convergence_rates() and evaluate_all_convergence_rates()
 * may be called.
 *
 * There are two possibilities of how to evaluate the convergence rates of
 * multiple columns in the same RateMode.
 * <ol>
 * <li> call evaluate_convergence_rates() for all wanted columns
 * <li> call omit_column_from_convergence_rate_evaluation() for all columns
 * for which this evaluation is not desired and then
 * evaluate_all_convergence_rates() to evaluate the convergence rates of all
 * columns that have not been flagged for omission.
 * </ol>
 *
 * A detailed discussion of this class can also be found in the step-7 and
 * step-13 example programs.

   * Evaluates the convergence rates of the data column

   * reference column <tt>reference_column_key</tt>. Be sure that the value
   * types of the table entries of the data column and the reference data
   * column is a number, i.e. double, float, (unsigned) int, and so on.
   *
   * As this class has no information on the space dimension upon which the
   * reference column vs. the value column is based upon, it needs to be
   * passed as last argument to this method. The <i>default dimension for the
   * reference column</i> is 2, which is appropriate for the number of cells
   * in 2D. If you work in 3D, set the number to 3. If the reference column is
   * $1/h$, remember to set the dimension to 1 also when working in 3D to get
   * correct rates.
   *
   * The new rate column and the data column will be merged to a supercolumn.
   * The tex caption of the supercolumn will be (by default) the same as the
   * one of the data column. This may be changed by using the
   * <tt>set_tex_supercaption (...)</tt> function of the base class
   * TableHandler.
   *
   * This method behaves in the following way:
   *
   * If RateMode is reduction_rate, then the computed output is $
   * \frac{e_{n-1}/k_{n-1}}{e_n/k_n}, $ where $k$ is the reference column (no
   * dimension dependence!).
   *
   * If RateMode is reduction_rate_log2, then the computed output is $ dim
   * \frac{\log |e_{n-1}/e_{n}|}{\log |k_n/k_{n-1}|} $.
   *
   * This is useful, for example, if we use as reference key the number of
   * degrees of freedom or better, the number of cells.  Assuming that the
   * error is proportional to $ C (1/\sqrt{k})^r $ in 2D, then this method
   * will produce the rate $r$ as a result. For general dimension, as
   * described by the last parameter of this function, the formula needs to be
   * $ C (1/\sqrt[dim]{k})^r $.
   *
   * @note Since this function adds columns to the table after several rows
   * have already been filled, it switches off the auto fill mode of the
   * TableHandler base class. If you intend to add further data with auto
   * fill, you will have to re-enable it after calling this function.
