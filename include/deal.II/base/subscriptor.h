/**
 * Handling of subscriptions.
 *
 * This class, as a base class, allows to keep track of other objects using a
 * specific object. It is used to avoid that pointers that point to an object of
 * a class derived from Subscriptor are referenced after that object has been
 * invalidated. Here, invalidation is assumend to happen when the object is
 * moved from or destroyed.
 * The mechanism works as follows: The member function subscribe() accepts a
 * pointer to a boolean that is modified on invalidation. The object that owns
 * this pointer (usually an object of class type SmartPointer) is then expected
 * to check the state of the boolean before trying to access this class.
 *
 * The utility of this class is even enhanced by providing identifying strings
 * to the functions subscribe() and unsubscribe(). These strings are represented
 * as <code>const char</code> pointers since the underlying buffer comes from
 * (and is managed by) the run-time type information system: more exactly, these
 * pointers are the result the function call <code>typeid(x).name()</code> where
 * <code>x</code> is some object. Therefore, the pointers provided to
 * subscribe() and to unsubscribe() must be the same. Strings with equal
 * contents will not be recognized to be the same. The handling in
 * SmartPointer will take care of this.
 * The current subscribers to this class can be obtained by calling
 * list_subscribers().
