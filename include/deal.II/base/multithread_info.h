/**
 * This class provides information about the system which may be of use in
 * multithreaded programs.  At the moment this is just the number of CPUs. If
 * deal.II is compiled with multithreading support, some functions will use
 * multiple threads for their action. Currently the library supports both
 * thread-based and task-based parallelism.
 * @ref threads
 * describes the different uses of each. The default number of threads used
 * for task-based parallel methods is selected automatically by the Threading
 * Building Blocks library. See
 * @ref threads
 * for more information on this.  Thread-based parallel methods need to
 * explicitly created threads and may want to use a number of threads that is
 * related to the number of CPUs in your system. The recommended number of
 * threads can be queried using MultithreadInfo::n_threads(), while the number
 * of cores in the system is returned by MultithreadInfo::n_cores().
