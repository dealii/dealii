/**
 * Provides a means to keep track of the simulation time in a time-dependent
 * simulation. It manages stepping forward from an initial time to a final
 * time. It also allows adjusting the time step size during the simulation.
 * It is guaranteed that at all times the current simulation time is in the
 * closed interval between the start time and the end time.
 *
 * You can loop over all of the time steps by using a for loop
 * @code
 *   for (DiscreteTime time(0., 1., 0.3);
 *        time.get_current_time() != time.get_end_time();
 *        time.advance_time())
 *   {
 *     // Insert simulation code here
 *   }
 * @code
 *
 * In the above example the time starts at $t = 0$. Assuming the time step
 * $dt = 0.3$ is not modified inside the loop, the time is advanced to
 * $t = 0.3$, $t = 0.6$, $t = 0.9$ and finally it reaches the end time at
 * $t = 1.0$. Note that the final step size is automatically reduced to
 * $dt = 0.1$ in order to ensure that we finish the simulation exactly at
 * the specified end time.
