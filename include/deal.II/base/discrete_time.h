/**
 * This class provides a means to keep track of the simulation time in a
 * time-dependent simulation. It manages stepping forward from a start time
 * $T_{\text{start}}$ to an end time $T_{\text{end}}$. It also allows adjusting
 * the time step size during the simulation. It is guaranteed that at all times
 * the current simulation time is in the closed interval between the start time
 * and the end time.
 *
 * The model this class follows is that one sets a *desired* time step length
 * either through the constructor or using set_desired_next_step_size()
 * function. This step size will then be used in all following calls to the
 * advance_time() function, but may be adjusted slightly towards the end of the
 * simulation to ensure that the simulation time hits the end time exactly. The
 * adjustment is useful for the following reasons:
 *
 * Let's say that you loop over all of the time steps by using a for loop
 * @code
 *   for (DiscreteTime time(0., 1., 0.3);
 *        time.get_current_time() != time.get_end_time();
 *        time.advance_time())
 *   {
 *     // Insert simulation code here
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * In the above example the time starts at $T_{\text{start}} = 0$ until
 * $T_{\text{end}}=1$. Assuming the (desired) time step $dt = 0.3$ is not
 * modified inside the loop, the time is advanced from $t = 0$ to $t = 0.3$, $t
 * = 0.6$, $t = 0.9$ and finally it reaches the end time at $t = 1.0$. Here, the
 * final step size needs to be reduced from its desired value of 0.3 to $dt =
 * 0.1$ in order to ensure that we finish the simulation exactly at the
 * specified end time. In fact, you should assume that not only the last time
 * step length may be adjusted, but also previously ones -- for example, this
 * class may take the liberty to spread the decrease in time step size out over
 * several time steps and increment time from $t=0$, to $0.3$, $0.6$, $0.8$, and
 * finally $t=T_{\text{end}}=1$ to avoid too large a change in time step size
 * from one step to another.
 *
 * The other situation in which the time step needs to be adjusted (this time to
 * slightly larger values) is if a time increment falls just short of the final
 * time. Imagine, for example, a similar situation as above, but with different
 * end time:
 * @code
 *   for (DiscreteTime time(0., 1.21, 0.3);
 *        time.get_current_time() != time.get_end_time();
 *        time.advance_time())
 *   {
 *     // Insert simulation code here
 *   }
 * @endcode
 * Here, the time step from $t=0.9$ to $t=1.2$ falls just short of the final
 * time $T_{\text{end}}=1.21$. Instead of following up with a very small step of
 * length $dt=0.01$, the class stretches the last time step (or last time steps)
 * slightly to reach the desired end time.
 *
 * The examples above make clear that the time step size given to this class is
 * only a *desired* step size. You can query the actual time step size using the
 * get_next_step_size() function.
