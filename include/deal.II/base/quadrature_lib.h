 * You have to make sure that the point $x_0$ is not one of the Gauss

 *
 * This quadrature formula is rather expensive, since it uses internally two

 * factored out of the quadrature formula, and you should provide a function
 * $g(x)$, which should at least be similar to $\ln(|x-x_0|/\alpha)$.

 * properties when $\beta = 1$ with singularities of order $1/R$ in the origin,
 * but different $\beta$ values can be selected to increase convergence and/or
 * accuracy when higher order Gauss rules are used (see "Generalized Duffy
 * transformation for integrating vertex singularities", S. E. Mousavi, N.
 * Sukumar, Computational Mechanics 2009).
 *
