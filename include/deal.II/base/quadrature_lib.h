 * $x_0$ and $\alpha$ are given at construction time, and are the location of
 * the singularity $x_0$ and an arbitrary scaling factor in the singularity.
 *
 * You have to make sure that the point $x_0$ is not one of the Gauss
 * quadrature points of order $N$, otherwise an exception is thrown, since the
 * quadrature weights cannot be computed correctly.
 *
 * This quadrature formula is rather expensive, since it uses internally two
 * Gauss quadrature formulas of order n to integrate the nonsingular part of
 * the factor, and two GaussLog quadrature formulas to integrate on the
 * separate segments $[0,x_0]$ and $[x_0,1]$. If the singularity is one of the
 * extremes and the factor alpha is 1, then this quadrature is the same as
 * QGaussLog.
 *
 * The last argument from the constructor allows you to use this quadrature
 * rule in one of two possible ways: \f[ \int_0^1 g(x) dx = \int_0^1 f(x)
 * \ln\left(\frac{|x-x_0|}{\alpha}\right) dx = \sum_{i=0}^N w_i g(q_i) =

 * Which one of the two sets of weights is provided, can be selected by the @p
 * factor_out_singular_weight parameter. If it is false (the default), then
 * the $\bar{w}_i$ weigths are computed, and you should provide only the
 * smooth function $f(x)$, since the singularity is included inside the
 * quadrature. If the parameter is set to true, then the singularity is
 * factored out of the quadrature formula, and you should provide a function
 * $g(x)$, which should at least be similar to $\ln(|x-x_0|/\alpha)$.
 *
 * Notice that this quadrature rule is worthless if you try to use it for
 * regular functions once you factored out the singularity.

 * transformed into a triangle by collapsing one of the sides adjacent to the

 * removed before scaling the original quadrature, and this process is
