       * the same thread object at the same time, but this action is undefined
       * anyway since they can not both join the same thread. That said, more
       * recent C++ standards do not appear to have the requirement any more
       * that the only thread that can call join() is the one that created the
       * thread. Neither does `pthread_join` appear to have this requirement any

   * calling Threads::new_thread() with either objects that result from using
   * std::bind, or using lambda functions. For example, this function is called
   * when writing code such as
   * @code
   * Threads::Thread<int>
   *   thread = Threads::new_thread ( [] () {
   *                                          do_this();

   * @endcode
   * Here, we run the sequence of functions
   * <code>do_this()</code> and <code>then_do_that()</code> on
   * a separate thread, by making the lambda function declared here the
   * function to execute on the thread. The lambda function then returns
   * 42 (which is a bit pointless here, but it could of course be some
   * computed number), and this is going to be the returned value you
   * can later retrieve via <code>thread.return_value()</code> once the
   * thread (i.e., the body of the lambda function) has completed.
   *
   * @note Every lambda function (or whatever else it is you pass to
   *   the new_thread() function here, for example the result of a
   *   std::bind() expression) has a return type and consequently
   *   returns an object of this type. This type can be inferred
   *   using the C++11 <code>decltype</code> statement used in the
   *   declaration of this function, and it is then used as the template
   *   argument of the Threads::Thread object returned by the current function.
   *   In the example above, because the lambda function returns 42
   *   (which in C++ has data type <code>int</code>), the inferred
   *   type is <code>int</code> and the task object will have type
   *   <code>Task@<int@></code>. In other words, it is not <i>necessary</i>
   *   to explicitly specify in user code what that return type
   *   of the lambda or std::bind expression will be, though it is
   *   possible to explicitly do so by (entirely equivalently) writing
   *   @code
   *   Threads::Thread<int>
   *     thread = Threads::new_thread ( [] () -> int {
   *                                                   do_this();
   *                                                   then_do_that();
   *                                                   return 42;
   *                                                 });
   *   @endcode
   *
   * @note In practice, the lambda functions you will pass to
   *   new_thread() will of course typically be more complicated.
   *   In particular, they will likely <i>capture</i> variables
   *   from the surrounding context and use them within the lambda.
   *   See
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function#C.2B.2B_.28since_C.2B.2B11.29
   *   for more on how lambda functions work.
   *
   * @note If you pass a lambda function as an argument to the
   *   current function that captures a variable <i>by reference</i>,
   *   or if you use a std::bind that binds a function argument to
   *   a reference variable using std::ref() or std::cref(), then
   *   obviously you can only do this if the variables you reference
   *   or capture have a lifetime that extends at least until the time
   *   where the thread finishes.

  /**
   * Overload of the new_task function for objects that can be called like a
   * function object without arguments. In particular, this function allows
   * calling Threads::new_task() with either objects that result from using
   * std::bind, or using lambda functions. For example, this function is called
   * when writing code such as
   * @code
   * Threads::Task<int>
   *   task = Threads::new_task ( [] () {
   *                                      do_this();
   *                                      then_do_that();
   *                                      return 42;
   *                                    });
   * @endcode
   * Here, we schedule the call to the sequence of functions
   * <code>do_this()</code> and <code>then_do_that()</code> on
   * a separate task, by making the lambda function declared here the
   * function to execute on the task. The lambda function then returns
   * 42 (which is a bit pointless here, but it could of course be some
   * computed number), and this is going to be the returned value you
   * can later retrieve via <code>task.return_value()</code> once the
   * task (i.e., the body of the lambda function) has completed.
   *
   * @note When MultithreadInfo::n_threads() returns 1, i.e., if the
   *   deal.II runtime system has been configured to only use one
   *   thread, then this function just executes the given function
   *   object immediately and stores the return value in the Task
   *   object returned by this function.
   *
   * @note Every lambda function (or whatever else it is you pass to
   *   the new_task() function here, for example the result of a
   *   std::bind() expression) has a return type and consequently
   *   returns an object of this type. This type can be inferred
   *   using the C++11 <code>decltype</code> statement used in the
   *   declaration of this function, and it is then used as the template
   *   argument of the Threads::Task object returned by the current function.
   *   In the example above, because the lambda function returns 42
   *   (which in C++ has data type <code>int</code>), the inferred
   *   type is <code>int</code> and the task object will have type
   *   <code>Task@<int@></code>. In other words, it is not <i>necessary</i>
   *   to explicitly specify in user code what that return type
   *   of the lambda or std::bind expression will be, though it is
   *   possible to explicitly do so by (entirely equivalently) writing
   *   @code
   *   Threads::Task<int>
   *     task = Threads::new_task ( [] () -> int {
   *                                               do_this();
   *                                               then_do_that();
   *                                               return 42;
   *                                             });
   *   @endcode
   *
   * @note In practice, the lambda functions you will pass to
   *   new_task() will of course typically be more complicated.
   *   In particular, they will likely <i>capture</i> variables
   *   from the surrounding context and use them within the lambda.
   *   See
   * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function#C.2B.2B_.28since_C.2B.2B11.29
   *   for more on how lambda functions work.
   *
   * @note If you pass a lambda function as an argument to the
   *   current function that captures a variable <i>by reference</i>,
   *   or if you use a std::bind that binds a function argument to
   *   a reference variable using std::ref() or std::cref(), then
   *   obviously you can only do this if the variables you reference
   *   or capture have a lifetime that extends at least until the time
   *   where the task finishes.
   *
   * @note Threads::new_task() is, in essence, equivalent to calling
   *   `std::async(std::launch::async, ...)` in that it runs the given task
   *   in the background. (See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/async
   *   for more information.) The only difference is if you configured deal.II
   *   with `DEAL_II_WITH_THREADS=OFF`, then the operation described by the
   *   arguments of this function are executed immediately and the returned

   *   cases where one wants to run a program in a way where deal.II does not
   *   internally create parallel tasks, for example because one is already
