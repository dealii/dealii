/**
 * Base class for quadrature formulæ in arbitrary dimensions. This class
 * stores quadrature points and weights on the unit line [0,1], unit square
 * [0,1]x[0,1], etc.
 *
 * There are a number of derived classes, denoting concrete integration
 * formulæ. Their names names prefixed by <tt>Q</tt>. Refer to the list of
 * derived classes for more details.
 *
 * The schemes for higher dimensions are typically tensor products of the one-
 * dimensional formulæ, but refer to the section on implementation detail
 * below.
 *
 * In order to allow for dimension independent programming, a quadrature
 * formula of dimension zero exists. Since an integral over zero dimensions is
 * the evaluation at a single point, any constructor of such a formula
 * initializes to a single quadrature point with weight one. Access to the
 * weight is possible, while access to the quadrature point is not permitted,
 * since a Point of dimension zero contains no information. The main purpose
 * of these formulæ is their use in QProjector, which will create a useful
 * formula of dimension one out of them.
 *
 * <h3>Mathematical background</h3>
 *
 * For each quadrature formula we denote by <tt>m</tt>, the maximal degree of
 * polynomials integrated exactly. This number is given in the documentation
 * of each formula. The order of the integration error is <tt>m+1</tt>, that
 * is, the error is the size of the cell to the <tt>m+1</tt> by the Bramble-
 * Hilbert Lemma. The number <tt>m</tt> is to be found in the documentation of
 * each concrete formula. For the optimal formulæ QGauss we have $m = 2N-1$,
 * where N is the constructor parameter to QGauss. The tensor product formulæ
 * are exact on tensor product polynomials of degree <tt>m</tt> in each space
 * direction, but they are still only of <tt>m+1</tt>st order.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation details</h3>
 *
 * Most integration formulæ in more than one space dimension are tensor
 * products of quadrature formulæ in one space dimension, or more generally
 * the tensor product of a formula in <tt>(dim-1)</tt> dimensions and one in
 * one dimension. There is a special constructor to generate a quadrature
 * formula from two others.  For example, the QGauss@<dim@> formulæ include
 * <i>N<sup>dim</sup></i> quadrature points in <tt>dim</tt> dimensions, where
 * N is the constructor parameter of QGauss.
 *
 * @note Instantiations for this template are provided for dimensions 0, 1, 2,
 * and 3 (see the section on
 * @ref Instantiations).

 *
 * In one space dimension, the given base formula is copied and scaled onto a
