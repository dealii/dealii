     * 2x2 grid with the 5-th processor being inactive:

     *      |   0     |   1
     * -----| ------- |-----
     * 0    |   P0    |  P1

     * -----| ------- |-----
     * 1    |   P2    |  P3
     * @endcode
     *
     * A shared pointer to this class is provided to ScaLAPACKMatrix matrices to
     * perform block-cyclic distribution.
     *
     * Note that this class allows to setup a process grid which has fewer
     * MPI cores than the total number of cores in the communicator.
     *
     * Currently the only place where one would use a ProcessGrid object is
     * in connection with a ScaLAPACKMatrix object.
