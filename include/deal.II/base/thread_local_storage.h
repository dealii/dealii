   * @brief A class that provides a separate storage location on each thread
   * that accesses the object.
   *
   * This class offers ways so that every thread that accesses it has its own
   * copy of an object of type T. In essence, accessing this object can never
   * result in race conditions in multithreaded programs since no other thread
   * than the current one can ever access it.
   *
   * <h3>Construction and destruction</h3>
   *
   * Objects of this class can either be default constructed or by providing
   * an "exemplar", i.e. an object of type T so that every time we need to
   * create a T on a thread that doesn't already have such an object, it is
   * copied from the exemplar.
   *
   * Upon destruction of objects of this class, all T objects that correspond
   * to threads that have accessed this object are destroyed. Note that this
   * may be before the time when a thread is terminated.
   *
   * <h3>Access</h3>
   *
   * The T object stored by this object can be accessed using the get()
   * function. It provides a reference to a unique object when accessed from
   * different threads. Objects of type T are created lazily, i.e. they are
   * only created whenever a thread actually calls get().
