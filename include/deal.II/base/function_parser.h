/**
 * This class implements a function object that gets its value by parsing a
 * string describing this function. It is a wrapper class for the muparser
 * library (see https://beltoforion.de/en/muparser/). This class lets you
 * evaluate strings such as "sqrt(1-x^2+y^2)" for given values of 'x' and 'y'.
 * Please refer to the muparser documentation for more information.  This class
 * is used in the step-33 and step-36 tutorial programs (the latter being much
 * simpler to understand).
 *
 * In addition to the built-in functions of muparser, namely
 * @code
 * sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, atanh,
 * atan2, log2, log10, log, ln, exp, sqrt, sign, rint, abs, min, max, sum, avg
 * @endcode
 * this class also supports the following operations:
 * - <code>if(condition, then-value, else-value)</code>
 * - <code>|</code> and <code>&</code> (logic or and and)
 * - <code>int(x)</code>, <code>ceil(x)</code>, <code>floor(x)</code> (rounding)
 * - <code>cot(x)</code>, <code>csc(x)</code>, <code>sec(x)</code>
 * - <code>pow(x,n)</code>, <code>log(x)</code>
 * - <code>erfc(x)</code>
 * - <code>rand()</code>, <code>rand_seed(seed)</code>
 *
 * @note This class implements the list of functions just mentioned as
 *   user-defined functions by extending muparser. This means, in particular,
 *   that the `if(condition, then-value, else-value)` syntax evaluates all
 *   three arguments before determining whether the condition is true, and
 *   then discarding either the "then" or the "else" expressions. In almost
 *   all situations, this is not a problem except if the evaluation of
 *   one of the expressions throws a floating point exception in cases
 *   where it will later be discarded. (Assuming floating point exceptions
 *   are switched on, as is the default for deal.II in debug mode on most
 *   systems.) An example would be the expression `if(x>0, sqrt(x), 0)`
 *   which is mathematically well defined, but on systems where this is
 *   enabled will abort the program with a floating point exception when
 *   evaluated with a negative `x`. This is because the square root of
 *   `x` is computed before the `if` statement's condition is considered
 *   to determine whether the result should be the second or third
 *   argument. If this kind of behavior is a problem, you can resort to
 *   the muparser built-in syntax `(condition ? then-value : else-value)`,
 *   using the ternary syntax familiar to C++ programmers. If this
 *   syntax is used, muparser uses lazy evaluation in which only one of the
 *   branches is evaluated, depending on whether the `condition` is
 *   true or false.
 *
 * The following examples shows how to use this class:
 * @code
 * // set up problem:
 * std::string variables = "x,y";
 * std::string expression = "cos(x) + sqrt(y)";
 * std::map<std::string, double> constants;
 *
 * // FunctionParser with 2 variables and 1 component:
 * FunctionParser<2> fp(1);
 * fp.initialize(variables,
 *               expression,
 *               constants);
 *
 * // Point at which we want to evaluate the function
 * Point<2> point(0.0, 4.0);
 *
 * // evaluate the expression at 'point':
 * double result = fp.value(point);
 *
 * deallog << "Function '" << expression << "'"
 *         << " @ " << point
 *         << " is " << result << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 * The second example is a bit more complex:
 * @code
 * // Define some constants that will be used by the function parser
 * std::map<std::string, double> constants;
 * constants["pi"] = numbers::PI;
 *
 * // Define the variables that will be used inside the expressions
 * std::string variables = "x,y,z";
 *
 * // Define the expressions of the individual components of a
 * // vector valued function with two components:
 * std::vector<std::string> expressions(2);
 * expressions[0] = "sin(2*pi*x)+sinh(pi*z)";
 * expressions[1] = "sin(2*pi*y)*exp(x^2)";
 *
 * // function parser with 3 variables and 2 components
 * FunctionParser<3> vector_function(2);
 *
 * // And populate it with the newly created objects.
 * vector_function.initialize(variables,
 *                            expressions,
 *                            constants);
 *
 * // Point at which we want to evaluate the function
 * Point<3> point(0.0, 1.0, 1.0);
 *
 * // This Vector will store the result
 * Vector<double> result(2);
 *
 * // Fill 'result' by evaluating the function
 * vector_function.vector_value(point, result);
 *
 * // We can also only evaluate the 2nd component:
 * const double c = vector_function.value(point, 1);
 *
 * // Output the evaluated function
 * deallog << "Function '" << expressions[0] << "," << expressions[1] << "'"
 *         << " at " << point
 *         << " is " << result << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 *
 * This class overloads the virtual methods value() and vector_value() of the
 * Function base class with the byte compiled versions of the expressions
 * given to the initialize() methods. Note that the class will not work unless
 * you first call the initialize() method that accepts the text description of
 * the function as an argument (among other things).
 *
 * The syntax to describe a function follows usual programming practice, and
 * is explained in detail at the homepage of the underlying muparser library
 * at https://beltoforion.de/en/muparser/.
 *
 * For a wrapper of the FunctionParser class that supports ParameterHandler,
 * see Functions::ParsedFunction.
 *
 * Vector-valued functions can either be declared using strings where the
 * function components are separated by semicolons, or using a vector of
 * strings each defining one vector component.
 *
 * An example of time dependent scalar function is the following:
 * @code
 *    // Empty constants object
 *    std::map<std::string,double> constants;
 *
 *    // Variables that will be used inside the expressions
 *    std::string variables = "x,y,t";
 *
 *    // Define the expression of the scalar time dependent function.
 *    std::string expression = "exp(y*x)*exp(-t)";
 *
 *    // Generate an empty scalar function
 *    FunctionParser<2> function;
 *
 *    // And populate it with the newly created objects.
 *    function.initialize(variables,
 *                        expression,
 *                        constants,
 * // Treat the last variable ("t") as time.
 *                        true);
 * @endcode
 *
 * The following is another example of how to instantiate a vector valued
 * function by using a single string:
 * @code
 *    // Empty constants object
 *    std::map<std::string,double> constants;
 *
 *    // Variables that will be used inside the expressions
 *    std::string variables = "x,y";
 *
 *    // Define the expression of the vector valued  function.
 *    std::string expression = "cos(2*pi*x)*y^2; sin(2*pi*x)*exp(y)";
 *
 *    // Generate an empty vector valued function
 *    FunctionParser<2> function(2);
 *
 *    // And populate it with the newly created objects.
 *    function.initialize(variables,
 *                        expression,
 *                        constants);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The difference between this class and the SymbolicFunction class is
 * that the SymbolicFunction class allows to compute first and second order
 * derivatives (in a symbolic way), while this class computes first order
 * derivatives only, using finite differences. For complicated expressions,
 * this class is generally faster than SymbolicFunction.
 *
