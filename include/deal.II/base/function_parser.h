/**
 * This class implements a function object that gets its value by parsing a
 * string describing this function. It is a wrapper class for the muparser
 * library (see http://muparser.beltoforion.de/). This class lets you evaluate
 * strings such as "sqrt(1-x^2+y^2)" for given values of 'x' and 'y'.  Please
 * refer to the muparser documentation for more information.  This class is
 * used in the step-33 and step-36 tutorial programs (the latter being much
 * simpler to understand).
 *
 * The following examples shows how to use this class:
 * @code
 * // set up problem:
 * std::string variables = "x,y";
 * std::string expression = "cos(x)+sqrt(y)";
 * std::map<std::string,double> constants;
 *
 * // FunctionParser with 2 variables and 1 component:
 * FunctionParser<2> fp(1);
 * fp.initialize(variables,
 *               expression,
 *               constants);
 *
 * // Point at which we want to evaluate the function
 * Point<2> point(0.0, 4.0);
 *
 * // evaluate the expression at 'point':
 * double result = fp.value(point);
 *
 * deallog << "Function '" << expression << "'"
 *         << " @ " << point
 *         << " is " << result << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 * The second example is a bit more complex:
 * @code
 * // Define some constants that will be used by the function parser
 * std::map<std::string,double> constants;
 * constants["pi"] = numbers::PI;
 *
 * // Define the variables that will be used inside the expressions
 * std::string variables = "x,y,z";
 *
 * // Define the expressions of the individual components of a
 * // vector valued function with two components:
 * std::vector<std::string> expressions(2);
 * expressions[0] = "sin(2*pi*x)+sinh(pi*z)";
 * expressions[1] = "sin(2*pi*y)*exp(x^2)";
 *
 * // function parser with 3 variables and 2 components
 * FunctionParser<3> vector_function(2);
 *
 * // And populate it with the newly created objects.
 * vector_function.initialize(variables,
 *                            expressions,
 *                            constants);
 *
 * // Point at which we want to evaluate the function
 * Point<3> point(0.0, 1.0, 1.0);
 *
 * // This Vector will store the result
 * Vector<double> result(2);
 *
 * // Fill 'result' by evaluating the function
 * vector_function.vector_value(point, result);
 *
 * // We can also only evaluate the 2nd component:
 * const double c = vector_function.value(point, 1);
 *
 * // Output the evaluated function
 * deallog << "Function '" << expressions[0] << "," << expressions[1] << "'"
 *         << " at " << point
 *         << " is " << result << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 *
 * This class overloads the virtual methods value() and vector_value() of the
 * Function base class with the byte compiled versions of the expressions
 * given to the initialize() methods. Note that the class will not work unless
 * you first call the initialize() method that accepts the text description of
 * the function as an argument (among other things).
 *
 * The syntax to describe a function follows usual programming practice, and
 * is explained in detail at the homepage of the underlying muparser library
 * at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/ .
 *
 * For a wrapper of the FunctionParser class that supports ParameterHandler,
 * see ParsedFunction.
 *
 * Vector-valued functions can either be declared using strings where the
 * function components are separated by semicolons, or using a vector of
 * strings each defining one vector component.
 *
 * An example of time dependent scalar function is the following:
 * @code
 *    // Empty constants object
 *    std::map<std::string> constants;
 *
 *    // Variables that will be used inside the expressions
 *    std::string variables = "x,y,t";
 *
 *    // Define the expression of the scalar time dependent function.
 *    std::string expression = "exp(y*x)*exp(-t)";
 *
 *    // Generate an empty scalar function
 *    FunctionParser<2> function;
 *
 *    // And populate it with the newly created objects.
 *    function.initialize(variables,
 *                        expression,
 *                        constants,
 *                        true);        // This tells the parser that
 *                                      // it is a time-dependent function
 *                                      // and there is another variable
 *                                      // to be taken into account (t).
 * @endcode
 *
 * The following is another example of how to instantiate a vector valued
 * function by using a single string:
 * @code
 *    // Empty constants object
 *    std::map<std::string> constants;
 *
 *    // Variables that will be used inside the expressions
 *    std::string variables = "x,y";
 *
 *    // Define the expression of the vector valued  function.
 *    std::string expression = "cos(2*pi*x)*y^2; sin(2*pi*x)*exp(y)";
 *
 *    // Generate an empty vector valued function
 *    FunctionParser<2> function(2);
 *
 *    // And populate it with the newly created objects.
 *    function.initialize(variables,
 *                        expression,
 *                        constants);
 * @endcode
 *

   * that we want to specify in our expressions (in the example above the
