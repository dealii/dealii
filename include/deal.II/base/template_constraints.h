/**
 * This specialization of the general template for the case of a <tt>true</tt>
 * first template argument declares a local typedef <tt>type</tt> to the
 * second template argument. It is used in order to construct constraints on
 * template arguments in template (and member template) functions. The
 * negative specialization is missing.
 *
 * Here's how the trick works, called SFINAE (substitution failure is not an
 * error): The C++ standard prescribes that a template function is only
 * considered in a call, if all parts of its signature can be instantiated
 * with the template parameter replaced by the respective types/values in this
 * particular call. Example:
 * @code
 *   template <typename T>
 *   typename T::type  foo(T) {...};
 *   ...
 *   foo(1);
 * @endcode
 * The compiler should detect that in this call, the template parameter T must
 * be identified with the type "int". However, the return type T::type does
 * not exist. The trick now is that this is not considered an error: this
 * template is simply not considered, the compiler keeps on looking for
 * another possible function foo.
 *
 * The idea is then to make the return type un-instantiatable if certain
 * constraints on the template types are not satisfied:
 * @code
 *   template <bool, typename> struct constraint_and_return_value;
 *   template <typename T> struct constraint_and_return_value<true,T> {
 *     typedef T type;
 *   };
 * @endcode
 * constraint_and_return_value<false,T> is not defined. Given something like
 * @code
 *   template <typename>
 *   struct int_or_double         { static const bool value = false;};
 *   template <>
 *   struct int_or_double<int>    { static const bool value = true; };
 *   template <>
 *   struct int_or_double<double> { static const bool value = true; };
 * @endcode
 * we can write a template
 * @code
 *   template <typename T>
 *   typename constraint_and_return_value<int_or_double<T>::value,void>::type
 *   f (T);
 * @endcode
 * which can only be instantiated if T=int or T=double. A call to f('c') will
 * just fail with a compiler error: "no instance of f(char) found". On the
 * other hand, if the predicate in the first argument to the
 * constraint_and_return_value template is true, then the return type is just
 * the second type in the template.

/**
 * A template class that simply exports its template argument as a local
 * typedef. This class, while at first appearing useless, makes sense in the
 * following context: if you have a function template as follows:
 * @code
 *   template <typename T> void f(T, T);
 * @endcode
 * then it can't be called in an expression like <code>f(1, 3.141)</code>
 * because the type <code>T</code> of the template can not be deduced in a
 * unique way from the types of the arguments. However, if the template is
 * written as
 * @code
 *   template <typename T> void f(T, typename identity<T>::type);
 * @endcode
 * then the call becomes valid: the type <code>T</code> is not deducible from
 * the second argument to the function, so only the first argument
 * participates in template type resolution.
 *
 * The context for this feature is as follows: consider
 * @code
 * template <typename RT, typename A>
 * void forward_call(RT (*p) (A), A a)  { p(a); }
 *
 * void h (double);
 *
 * void g()
 * {
 *   forward_call(&h, 1);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * This code fails to compile because the compiler can't decide whether the
 * template type <code>A</code> should be <code>double</code> (from the
 * signature of the function given as first argument to
 * <code>forward_call</code>, or <code>int</code> because the expression
 * <code>1</code> has that type. Of course, what we would like the compiler to
 * do is simply cast the <code>1</code> to <code>double</code>. We can achieve
 * this by writing the code as follows:
 * @code
 * template <typename RT, typename A>
 * void forward_call(RT (*p) (A), typename identity<A>::type a)  { p(a); }
 *
 * void h (double);
 *
 * void g()
 * {
 *   forward_call(&h, 1);
 * }
 * @endcode

 * arguments may be template types, and they may be the same type or not. In
 * this case, a simple comparison as in <tt>&object1 != &object2</tt> does

   * A type that is sometimes used for template tricks. For example, in some

   * @code

   *     // do something on subdim-dimensional sub-objects of the big

   * The problem is: the language doesn't allow us to specialize

   *
   * @code
   *   template <int N> struct int2type {};
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   class X {
   *     // do something on subdim-dimensional sub-objects of the big
   *     // dim-dimensional thing (for example on vertices/lines/quads of
   *     // cells):
   *     void f(int2type<0>);
   *     void f(int2type<1>);
   *     void f(int2type<2>);
   *     void f(int2type<3>);
   *   };
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   void X<dim>::f (int2type<0>) { ...operate on the vertices of a cell... }
   *
   *   template <int dim>
   *   void X<dim>::f (int2type<1>) { ...operate on the lines of a cell... }
   *
   *   template <int dim, int subdim> void g(X<dim> &x) {
   *     x.f (int2type<subdim>());
   *   }
   * @endcode
   *
   * Note that we have replaced specialization of <code>X::f()</code> by
   * overloading, but that from inside the function <code>g()</code>, we can
   * still select which of the different <code>X::f()</code> we want based on
   * the <code>subdim</code> template argument.
