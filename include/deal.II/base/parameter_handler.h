/**
 * The ParameterHandler class provides a standard interface to an input file
 * which provides at run-time for program parameters such as time step sizes,
 * geometries, right hand sides etc. The input for the program is given in
 * files, streams or strings in memory using text like
 *   @code
 *     set Time step size = 0.3
 *     set Geometry       = [0,1]x[0,3]
 *   @endcode
 * Input may be sorted into subsection trees in order to give the input a
 * logical structure, and input files may include other files.
 *
 * The ParameterHandler class is discussed in detail in the
 * @ref step_19 "step-19"
 * example program, and is used in more realistic situations in step-29,
 * step-33 and step-34.
 *
 * <h3>Declaring entries</h3>
 *
 * In order to use the facilities of a ParameterHandler object, one first has
 * to make known the different entries the input file may or may not contain.
 * This is done in the following way:
 *
 *   @code
 *     ...
 *     ParameterHandler prm;
 *     prm.declare_entry ("Time step size",
 *                       "0.2",
 *                       Patterns::Double(),
 *                       "Some documentation");
 *     prm.declare_entry ("Geometry",
 *                       "[0,1]x[0,1]",
 *                       Patterns::Anything());
 *     ...
 *   @endcode
 * Each entry is declared using the function declare_entry(). The first
 * parameter is the name of the entry (in short: the entry). The second is the
 * default answer to be taken in case the entry is not specified in the input
 * file. The third parameter is a regular expression which the input (and the
 * default answer) has to match.  Several such regular expressions are defined
 * in Patterns. This parameter can be omitted, in which case it will default
 * to Patterns::Anything, i.e. a pattern that matches every input string. The
 * fourth parameter can be used to document the intent or expected format of
 * an entry; its value is printed as a comment when writing all entries of a
 * ParameterHandler object using the print_parameters() function to allow for
 * easier understanding of a parameter file. It can be omitted as well, in
 * which case no such documentation will be printed.
 *
 * Entries may be located in subsections which form a kind of input tree. For
 * example input parameters for linear solver routines should be classified in
 * a subsection named <tt>Linear solver</tt> or any other suitable name. This
 * is accomplished in the following way:
 *   @code
 *     ...
 *       LinEq eq;
 *       eq.declare_parameters (prm);
 *     ...
 *
 *     void LinEq::declare_parameters (ParameterHandler &prm) {
 *       prm.enter_subsection("Linear solver");
 *       {
 *         prm.declare_entry ("Solver",
 *                            "CG",
 *                            Patterns::Selection("CG|GMRES|GaussElim"),
 *                            "Name of a linear solver for the inner iteration");
 *         prm.declare_entry ("Maximum number of iterations",
 *                            "20",
 *                            ParameterHandler::RegularExpressions::Integer());
 *         ...
 *       }
 *       prm.leave_subsection ();
 *     }
 *   @endcode
 *
 * Subsections may be nested. For example a nonlinear solver may have a linear
 * solver as member object. Then the function call tree would be something
 * like (if the class <tt>NonLinEq</tt> has a member variables <tt>eq</tt> of
 * type <tt>LinEq</tt>):
 *   @code
 *     void NonLinEq::declare_parameters (ParameterHandler &prm) {
 *       prm.enter_subsection ("Nonlinear solver");
 *       {
 *         prm.declare_entry ("Nonlinear method",
 *                            "Newton-Raphson",
 *                            ParameterHandler::RegularExpressions::Anything());
 *         eq.declare_parameters (prm);
 *       }
 *       prm.leave_subsection ();
 *     }
 *   @endcode
 *
 * For class member functions which declare the different entries we propose
 * to use the common name <tt>declare_parameters</tt>. In normal cases this
 * method can be <tt>static</tt> since the entries will not depend on any
 * previous knowledge. Classes for which entries should logically be grouped
 * into subsections should declare these subsections themselves. If a class
 * has two or more member variables of the same type both of which should have
 * their own parameters, this parent class' method <tt>declare_parameters</tt>
 * is responsible to group them into different subsections:
 *   @code
 *     void NonLinEq::declare_parameters (ParameterHandler &prm) {
 *       prm.enter_subsection ("Nonlinear solver");
 *       {
 *         prm.enter_subsection ("Linear solver 1");
 *         {
 *           eq1.declare_parameters (prm);
 *         }
 *         prm.leave_subsection ();
 *
 *         prm.enter_subsection ("Linear solver 2");
 *         {
 *           eq2.declare_parameters (prm);
 *         }
 *         prm.leave_subsection ();
 *       }
 *       prm.leave_subsection ();
 *     }
 *   @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h3>Input files and special characters</h3>
 *
 * For the first example above the input file would look like the following:
 *   @code
 *     ...
 *     subsection Nonlinear solver
 *       set Nonlinear method = Gradient
 *       # this is a comment
 *       subsection Linear solver
 *         set Solver                       = CG
 *         set Maximum number of iterations = 30
 *       end
 *     end
 *     ...                       # other stuff
 *   @endcode
 * The words <tt>subsection</tt>, <tt>set</tt> and <tt>end</tt> may be either
 * written in lowercase or uppercase letters. Leading and trailing whitespace
 * is removed, multiple whitespace is condensed into only one. Since the
 * latter applies also to the name of an entry, an entry name will not be
 * recognized if in the declaration multiple whitespace is used.
 *
 * In entry names and values the following characters are not allowed:
 * <tt>\#</tt>, <tt>{</tt>, <tt>}</tt>, <tt>|</tt>. Their use is reserved for
 * the MultipleParameterLoop class.
 *
 * Comments starting with \# are skipped.
 *
 * Continuation lines are allowed by means of the character <tt>\\</tt>, which
 * must be the last character (aside from whitespace, which is ignored) of the
 * line. When a line is a continuation (i.e., the previous line ended in a
 * <tt>\\</tt>), then, unlike the default behavior of the <tt>C</tt>
 * preprocessor, all whitespace at the beginning of the line is ignored.
 *
 * We propose to use the following scheme to name entries: start the first
 * word with a capital letter and use lowercase letters further on. The same
 * applies to the possible entry values to the right of the <tt>=</tt> sign.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Including other input files</h3>
 *
 * An input file can include other include files using the syntax
 *   @code
 *     ...
 *     include some_other_file.prm
 *     ...
 *   @endcode
 * The file so referenced is searched for relative to the current directory
 * (not relative to the directory in which the including parameter file is
 * located, since this is not known to all three versions of the parse_input()
 * function).
 *
 *
 * <h3>Reading data from input sources</h3>
 *
 * In order to read input there are three possibilities: reading from an
 * <tt>std::istream</tt> object, reading from a file of which the name is
 * given and reading from a string in memory in which the lines are separated
 * by <tt>@\n</tt> characters. These possibilities are used as follows:
 *   @code
 *     ParameterHandler prm;
 *     ...
 *     // declaration of entries
 *     ...
 *     prm.parse_input (std::cin); // read input from standard in,
 *     // or
 *     prm.parse_input ("simulation.prm");
 *     // or
 *     char *in = "set Time step size = 0.3 \n ...";
 *     prm.parse_input_from_string (in);
 *     ...
 *   @endcode
 * You can use several sources of input successively. Entries which are
 * changed more than once will be overwritten every time they are used.
 *
 * You should not try to declare entries using declare_entry() and
 * enter_subsection() with as yet unknown subsection names after using
 * parse_input(). The results in this case are unspecified.
 *
 * If an error occurs upon reading the input, error messages are written to
 * <tt>std::cerr</tt> and the reader function returns with a return value of
 * <code>false</code>. This is opposed to almost all other functions in
 * deal.II, which would normally throw an exception if an error occurs; this
 * difference in behavior is a relic of the fact that this class predates
 * deal.II and had previously been written for a different project.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Using the %ParameterHandler Graphical User Interface</h3>
 *
 * An alternative to using the hand-written input files shown above is to use
 * the graphical user interface (GUI) that accompanies this class.
 *
 * See <a href="https://github.com/dealii/parameter_gui">the parameter_gui
 * github repository</a> for further details.
 *
 * <h3>Getting entry values out of a %ParameterHandler object</h3>
 *
 * Each class gets its data out of a ParameterHandler object by calling the
 * get()  member functions like this:
 *   @code
 *      void NonLinEq::get_parameters (ParameterHandler &prm) {
 *       prm.enter_subsection ("Nonlinear solver");
 *       std::string method = prm.get ("Nonlinear method");
 *       eq.get_parameters (prm);
 *       prm.leave_subsection ();
 *     }
 *   @endcode
 * get() returns the value of the given entry. If the entry was not specified
 * in the input source(s), the default value is returned. You have to enter
 * and leave subsections exactly as you did when declaring subsection. You may
 * chose the order in which to transverse the subsection tree.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that only entries matching the given regular expression
 * are returned, i.e. an input entry value which does not match the regular
 * expression is not stored.
 *
 * You can use get() to retrieve the parameter in text form, get_integer() to
 * get an integer or get_double() to get a double. You can also use
 * get_bool(). It will cause an internal error if the string could not be
 * converted to an integer, double or a bool. This should, though, not happen
 * if you correctly specified the regular expression for this entry; you
 * should not try to get out an integer or a double from an entry for which no
 * according regular expression was set. The internal error is raised through
 * the Assert() macro family which only works in debug mode.
 *
 * If you want to print out all user selectable features, use the
 * print_parameters() function. It is generally a good idea to print all
 * parameters at the beginning of a log file, since this way input and output
 * are together in one file which makes matching at a later time easier.
 * Additionally, the function also print those entries which have not been
 * modified in the input file and are thus set to default values; since
 * default values may change in the process of program development, you cannot
 * know the values of parameters not specified in the input file.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3>Adding Actions to Parameters</h3>
 *
 * It is often convenient to have something happen as soon as a parameter
 * value is read. This could be a check that it is valid -- say, that a
 * file that is listed in the parameter file exists -- or to initiate
 * something else in response, such as setting a variable outside the
 * ParameterHandler (as in the example shown below). In almost all cases,
 * this "action" could also be initiated once all parameters are read
 * via parse_input(), but it is sometimes <i>convenient</i> to do it
 * right away.
 *
 * This is facilitated by the add_action() function that can be called
 * after declaring a parameter via declare_entry(). "Actions" are in essence
 * pointers to functions that will be called for parameters that have
 * associated actions. These functions take the value of a parameter as
 * argument, and can then do whatever they want with it -- e.g., save it
 * somewhere outside the ParameterHandler object. (Exactly when the
 * action is called is described in the documentation of the
 * add_action() function.) Of course, in C++ one doesn't usually pass
 * around the address of a function, but an action can be a function-like
 * object (taking a string as argument) that results from calling
 * @p std::bind, or more conveniently, it can be a
 * <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda">lambda
 * function</a> that has the form
 * @code
 *   [] (const std::string &value) { ... do something with the value ... }
 * @endcode
 * and that is attached to a specific parameter.
 *
 * A typical example of such an action would be as follows: let's assume
 * that you have a program that declares a parameter for the number
 * of iterations it is going to run, say
 * @code
 *   class MyAlgorithm
 *   {
 *      public:
 *        void run ();
 *      private:
 *        unsigned int n_iterations;
 *   };
 * @endcode
 * then one could obtain this parameter from a parameter file using a
 * code snippet in @p run() as follows:
 * @code
 *   void MyAlgorithm::run ()
 *   {
 *     ParameterHandler prm;
 *     prm.declare_entry ("Number of iterations",  // name of parameter
 *                        "10",                    // default value
 *                        Patterns::Integer(1,100),// allowed values: 1...100
 *                        "The number of ...");    // some documentation, to be completed
 *
 *     // next read the parameter from an input file...
 *     prm.parse_input ("my_algorithm.prm");
 *
 *     // ...and finally get the value for use in the program:
 *     n_iterations = prm.get_integer ("Number of iterations");
 *
 *     ... actual code doing something useful follows here...
 * @endcode
 *
 * This two-step process -- first declaring the parameter, and later reading
 * it -- is a bit cumbersome because one has to first declare <i>all</i>
 * parameters and at a later time retrieve them from the ParameterHandler
 * object. In large programs, these two things also often happen in
 * different functions.
 *
 * To avoid this, it would be nice if we could put both the declaration
 * and the retrieval into the same place. This can be done via actions,
 * and the function would then look like this:
 * @code
 *   void MyAlgorithm::run ()
 *   {
 *     ParameterHandler prm;
 *     prm.declare_entry ("Number of iterations",  // name of parameter
 *                        "10",                    // default value
 *                        Patterns::Integer(1,100),// allowed values: 1...100
 *                        "The number of ...");    // some documentation, to be completed
 *     prm.add_action ("Number of iterations",
 *                     [&](const std::string &value) {
 *                       this->n_iterations = Utilities::string_to_int(value);
 *                     });
 *
 *     // next read the parameter from an input file...
 *     prm.parse_input ("my_algorithm.prm");
 *
 *     ... actual code doing something useful follows here...
 * @endcode
 * Here, the action consists of a lambda function that takes the value
 * for this parameter as a string, and then converts it to an integer
 * to store in the variable where it belongs. This action is
 * executed inside the call to <code>prm.parse_input()</code>, and so
 * there is now no longer a need to extract the parameter's value
 * at a later time. Furthermore, the code that sets the member variable
 * is located right next to the place where the parameter is actually
 * declared, so we no longer need to have two separate parts of the code
 * base that deal with input parameters.
 *
 * Of course, it is possible to execute far more involved actions than
 * just setting a member variable as shown above, even though that is
 * a typical case.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Style guide for data retrieval</h3>
 *
 * We propose that every class which gets data out of a ParameterHandler
 * object provides a function named <tt>get_parameters</tt>. This should be
 * declared <tt>virtual</tt>. <tt>get_parameters</tt> functions in derived
 * classes should call the <tt>BaseClass::get_parameters</tt> function.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Experience with large parameter lists</h3>
 *
 * Experience has shown that in programs defining larger numbers of parameters
 * (more than, say, fifty) it is advantageous to define an additional class
 * holding these parameters. This class is more like a C-style structure,
 * having a large number of variables, usually public. It then has at least
 * two functions, which declare and parse the parameters. In the main program,
 * the main class has an object of this parameter class and delegates
 * declaration and parsing of parameters to this object.
 *
 * The advantage of this approach is that you can keep out the technical
 * details (declaration and parsing) out of the main class and additionally
 * don't clutter up your main class with dozens or more variables denoting the
 * parameters.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3>Worked Example</h3>
 *
 * This is the code:
 *   @code
 *   #include <deal.II/base/parameter_handler.h>
 *
 *   #include <iostream>
 *   #include <string>
 *
 *   using namespace dealii;
 *   class LinearEquation
 *   {
 *   public:
 *     static void declare_parameters (ParameterHandler &prm);

 *
 * <h3>Representation of Parameters</h3>
 *
 * Here is some more internal information about the representation of
 * parameters:
 *
 * Logically, parameters and the nested sections they are arranged in can be
 * thought of as a hierarchical directory structure, or a tree. Take, for
 * example, the following code declaring a set of parameters and sections they
 * live in:
 *   @code
 *     ParameterHandler prm;
 *
 *     prm.declare_entry ("Maximal number of iterations",
 *                        "10",
 *                        Patterns::Integer (1, 1000),
 *                        "A parameter that describes the maximal number of "
 *                        "iterations the CG method is to take before giving "
 *                        "up on a matrix.");
 *     prm.enter_subsection ("Preconditioner");
 *     {
 *       prm.declare_entry ("Kind",
 *                          "SSOR",
 *                          Patterns::Selection ("SSOR|Jacobi"),
 *                          "A string that describes the kind of preconditioner "
 *                          "to use.");
 *       prm.declare_entry ("Relaxation factor",
 *                          "1.0",
 *                          Patterns::Double (0, 1),
 *                          "The numerical value (between zero and one) for the "
 *                          "relaxation factor to use in the preconditioner.");
 *     }
 *     prm.leave_subsection ();
 *   @endcode
 *
 * We can think of the parameters so arranged as a file system in which every
 * parameter is a directory. The name of this directory is the name of the
 * parameter, and in this directory lie files that describe the parameter.
 * These files are at the time of writing this documentation (other fields,
 * such as those indicating "actions" may also exist in each directory):
 *
 * - <code>value</code>: The content of this file is the current value of this
 * parameter; initially, the content of the file equals the default value of
 * the parameter.
 * - <code>default_value</code>: The content of this file is the default value
 * value of the parameter.
 * - <code>pattern</code>: A textual representation of the pattern that
 * describes the parameter's possible values.
 * - <code>pattern_index</code>: A number that indexes the Patterns::PatternBase
 * object that is used to describe the parameter.
 * - <code>documentation</code>: The content of this file is the documentation
 * given for a parameter as the last argument of the
 * ParameterHandler::declare_entry call. With the exception of the
 * <code>value</code> file, the contents of files are never changed after
 * declaration of a parameter.
 *
 * Alternatively, a directory in this file system may not have a file called
 * <code>value</code> in it. In that case, the directory represents a
 * subsection as declared above, and the directory's name will correspond to
 * the name of the subsection. It will then have no files in it at all, but it
 * may have further directories in it: some of these directories will be
 * parameters (indicates by the presence of files) or further nested
 * subsections.
 *
 * Given this explanation, the code above will lead to a hierarchical
 * representation of data that looks like this (the content of files is
 * indicated at the right in a different font):
 *
 * @image html parameter_handler.png
 *
 * Once parameters have been read in, the contents of the <code>value</code>
 * "files" may be different while the other files remain untouched.
 *
 * Using the ParameterHandler::print_parameters() function with
 * ParameterHandler::XML as second argument, we can get a complete
 * representation of this data structure in XML. It will look like this:
 *   @code
 *   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
 *   <ParameterHandler>
 *     <Maximal_20number_20of_20iterations>
 *       <value>10</value>
 *       <default_value>10</default_value>
 *       <documentation>A parameter that describes the maximal number of iterations the CG method is to take before giving up on a matrix.</documentation>
 *       <pattern>0</pattern>
 *       <pattern_description>[Integer range 1...1000 (inclusive)]</pattern_description>
 *     </Maximal_20number_20of_20iterations>
 *     <Preconditioner>
 *       <Kind><value>SSOR</value>
 *         <default_value>SSOR</default_value>
 *         <documentation>A string that describes the kind of preconditioner to use.</documentation>
 *         <pattern>1</pattern>
 *         <pattern_description>SSOR|Jacobi</pattern_description>
 *       </Kind>
 *       <Relaxation_20factor>
 *         <value>1.0</value>
 *         <default_value>1.0</default_value>
 *         <documentation>The numerical value (between zero and one) for the relaxation factor to use in the preconditioner.</documentation>
 *         <pattern>2</pattern>
 *         <pattern_description>[Floating point range 0...1 (inclusive)]</pattern_description>
 *       </Relaxation_20factor>
 *     </Preconditioner>
 *   <ParameterHandler>
 *   @endcode
 * This representation closely resembles the directory/file structure
 * discussed above. The only difference is that directory and file names are
 * mangled: since they should only contain letters and numbers, every
 * character in their names that is not a letter or number is replaced by an
 * underscore followed by its two-digit hexadecimal representation. In
 * addition, the special name "value" is mangled when used as the name of a
 * parameter, given that this name is also used to name special files in the
 * hierarchy structure. Finally, the entire tree is wrapped into a tag
 * <code>%ParameterHandler</code> to satisfy the XML requirement that there be
 * only a single top-level construct in each file.
 *
 * The tree structure (and its XML representation) is what the graphical user
 * interface (see above) uses to represent parameters like a directory/file
 * collection.

   * value of the parameter as a (string) argument. See the general documentation
   * of this class for a longer description of actions, as well as examples.
   *
   * The action is executed in three different circumstances:
   * - With the default value of the parameter with name @p name, at
   *   the end of the current function. This is useful because it allows
   *   for the action to execute whatever it needs to do at least once
   *   for each parameter, even those that are not actually specified in
   *   the input file (and thus remain at their default values).
   * - Within the ParameterHandler::set() functions that explicitly
   *   set a value for a parameter.
   * - Within the parse_input() function and similar functions such
   *   as parse_input_from_string(). Here, the action is executed
   *   whenever the parameter with which it is associated is read
   *   from the input, after it has been established that the value
   *   so read matches the pattern that corresponds to this parameter,
   *   and before the value is actually saved.
   *
   * It is valid to add multiple actions to the same parameter. They will
   * in that case be executed in the same order in which they were added.
   *
   * @note Actions may modify all sorts of variables in their scope. The
   *  only thing an action should not modify is the ParameterHandler object
   *  it is attached to. In other words, it is not allowed to enter or
   *  leave sections of the current ParameterHandler object. It is, in
   *  principle, acceptable to call ParameterHandler::get() and related
   *  functions on other parameters in the current section, but since
   *  there is no guarantee about the order in which they will be read
   *  from an input file, you will not want to rely on the values these
   *  functions would return.
   *
   * @note Throwing an exception in an action is generally not a good
   *  idea, but yields fundamentally the same result as if one tries to
   *  read a parameter from a file for which the value does not satisfy
   *  the pattern associated with the parameter. In other words, the
   *  value just read is discarded, and ParameterHandler::parse_input()
   *  stops to read any further content from the file. See

   *
   * The primary purpose of this function is to allow for a backward

   * 2, not 1.

   * @param existing_entry_name The name of an existing parameter in the
   * current section that the alias should refer to.
   * @param alias_name An alternate name for the parameter referenced by the

   * @param alias_is_deprecated If true, mark the alias as deprecated. This

/**
 * The class MultipleParameterLoop offers an easy possibility to test several
 * parameter sets during one run of the program. For this it uses the
 * ParameterHandler class to read in data in a standardized form, searches for
 * variant entry values and performs a loop over all combinations of
 * parameters.
 *
 * Variant entry values are given like this:
 *   @verbatim
 *     set Time step size = { 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.3 }
 *   @endverbatim
 * The loop will then perform three runs of the program, one for each value of
 * <tt>Time step size</tt>, while all other parameters are as specified or
 * with their default value. If there are several variant entry values in the
 * input, a loop is performed for each combination of variant values:
 *   @verbatim
 *     set Time step size = { 0.1 | 0.2 }
 *     set Solver         = { CG  | GMRES }
 *   @endverbatim
 * will result in four runs of the programs, with time step 0.1 and 0.2 for
 * each of the two solvers.
 *
 * In addition to variant entries, this class also supports <i>array
 * entries</i> that look like this:
 *   @verbatim
 *     set Output file = ofile.{{ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 }}
 *   @endverbatim
 * This indicates that if there are variant entries producing a total of four
 * different runs, then we will write their results to the files
 * <tt>ofile.1</tt>, <tt>ofile.2</tt>, <tt>ofile.3</tt> and <tt>ofile.4</tt>,
 * respectively. Array entries do not generate multiple runs of the main loop
 * themselves, but if there are variant entries, then in the <i>n</i>th run of
 * the main loop, also the <i>n</i>th value of an array is returned.
 *
 * Since the different variants are constructed in the order of declaration,
 * not in the order in which the variant entries appear in the input file, it
 * may be difficult to guess the mapping between the different variants and
 * the appropriate entry in an array. You will have to check the order of
 * declaration, or use only one variant entry.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that only selections which match the regular expression
 * (pattern) given upon declaration of an entry are given back to the program.
 * If a variant value does not match the regular expression, the default value
 * is stored and an error is issued. Before the first run of the loop, all
 * possible values are checked for their conformance, so that the error is
 * issued at the very beginning of the program.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * The usage of this class is similar to the ParameterHandler class. First the
 * entries and subsections have to be declared, then a loop is performed in
 * which the different parameter sets are set, a new instance of a user class
 * is created which is then called. Taking the classes of the example for the
 * ParameterHandler class, the extended program would look like this:
 *   @code
 *     class HelperClass : public MultipleParameterLoop::UserClass
 *     {
 *     public:
 *       HelperClass ();
 *
 *       virtual void create_new (const unsigned int run_no);
 *       virtual void run (ParameterHandler &prm);
 *
 *       static void declare_parameters (ParameterHandler &prm);
 *     private:
 *       std::shared_ptr<Problem> p;
 *     };
 *
 *
 *     HelperClass::HelperClass () : p(0) {}
 *
 *
 *     void HelperClass::create_new (const unsigned int run_no)
 *     {
 *       p.reset(new Problem());
 *     }
 *
 *
 *     void HelperClass::declare_parameters (ParameterHandler &prm)
 *     {
 *       Problem::declare_parameters (prm);
 *     }
 *
 *
 *     void HelperClass::run (ParameterHandler &prm)
 *     {
 *       p->get_parameters (prm);
 *       p->do_useful_work ();
 *     }
 *
 *
 *
 *     int main ()
 *     {
 *       class MultipleParameterLoop prm;
 *       HelperClass h;
 *       HelperClass::declare_parameters (prm);
 *       prm.parse_input ("prmtest.prm");
 *       prm.loop (h);
 *       return 0;
 *     }
 *   @endcode
 *
 * As can be seen, first a new helper class has to be set up. This must
 * contain a virtual constructor for a problem class. You can also derive your
 * problem class from MultipleParameterLoop::UserClass and let
 * <tt>create_new</tt> clear all member variables. If you have access to all
 * inherited member variables in some way this is the recommended procedure. A
 * third possibility is to use multiple inheritance and derive a helper class
 * from both the MultipleParameterLoop::UserClass and the problem class. In
 * any case, <tt>create_new</tt> has to provide a clean problem object which
 * is the problem in the second and third possibility.
 *
 * The derived class also has to provide for member functions which declare
 * the entries and which run the program. Running the program includes getting
 * the parameters out of the ParameterHandler object.
 *
 * After defining an object of this helper class and an object of the
 * MultipleParameterLoop class, the entries have to be declared in the same
 * way as for the ParameterHandler class. Then the input has to be read.
 * Finally the loop is called. This executes the following steps:
 *   @code
 *     for (each combination)
 *       {
 *         UserObject.create_new (run_no);
 *
 *         // set parameters for this run
 *
 *         UserObject.run (*this);
 *       }
 *   @endcode
 * <tt>UserObject</tt> is the parameter to the <tt>loop</tt> function.
 * <tt>create_new</tt> is given the number of the run (starting from one) to
 * enable naming output files differently for each run.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Syntax for variant and array entry values</h3>
 *
 * Variant values are specified like <tt>prefix{ v1 | v2 | v3 | ...
 * }postfix</tt>. Whitespace to the right of the opening brace <tt>{</tt> is
 * ignored as well as to the left of the closing brace <tt>}</tt> while
 * whitespace on the respectively other side is not ignored. Whitespace around
 * the mid symbols <tt>|</tt> is also ignored. The empty selection <tt>prefix{
 * v1 | }postfix</tt> is also allowed and produces the strings
 * <tt>prefixv1postfix</tt> and <tt>prefixpostfix</tt>.
 *
 * The syntax for array values is equal, apart from the double braces:
 * <tt>prefix{{ v1 | v2 | v3 }}postfix</tt>.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Worked example</h3>
 *
 * Given the above extensions to the example program for the ParameterHandler
 * and the following input file
 *   @verbatim
 *     set Equation 1 = Poisson
 *     set Equation 2 = Navier-Stokes
 *     set Output file= results.{{ 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 }}
 *
 *     subsection Equation 1
 *       set Matrix type = Sparse
 *       subsection Linear solver
 *         set Solver                       = CG
 *         set Maximum number of iterations = { 10 | 20 | 30 }
 *       end
 *     end
 *
 *     subsection Equation 2
 *       set Matrix type = Full
 *       subsection Linear solver
 *         set Solver                       = { BiCGStab | GMRES }
 *         set Maximum number of iterations = 100
 *       end
 *     end
 *   @endverbatim
 * this is the output:
 *   @verbatim
 *     LinEq: Method=CG, MaxIterations=10
 *     LinEq: Method=BiCGStab, MaxIterations=100
 *     Problem: outfile=results.1
