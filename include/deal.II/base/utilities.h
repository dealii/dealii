   *
   * This function uses boost::serialization utilities to unpack the object
   * from a vector of characters, and it is the inverse of the function
   * Utilities::pack().
   *
   * The @p allow_compression parameter denotes if the buffer to
   * read from could have been previously compressed with ZLIB, and
   * is only of effect if ZLIB is enabled.
   *
   * @note This function exists due to a quirk of C++. Specifically,
   *  if you want to pack() or unpack() arrays of objects, then the
   *  following works:
   *  @code
   *    double array[3] = {1,2,3};
   *    std::vector<char> buffer = Utilities::pack(array);
   *  @endcode
   *  However, the converse does not:
   *  @code
   *    array = Utilities::unpack<double[3]>(buffer);
   *  @endcode
   *  This is because C++ does not allow functions to return arrays.
   *  The current function therefore allows to write
   *  @code
   *    Utilities::unpack(buffer, array);
   *  @endcode
   *  Note that unlike the other unpack() function, it is not necessary
   *  to explicitly specify the template arguments since they can be
   *  deduced from the second argument.

   * through a class hierarchy, and that the object pointed to is in
   * fact of a type that contains both a `From` and a `To`. An example
   * is if either `To` is derived from `From` or the other way around.
   *
   * The function throws an exception of type `std::bad_cast` if the
   * `dynamic_cast` does not succeed. This is the same exception you
   * would get if a regular `dynamic_cast` between object types (but not
   * pointer types) does not succeed.
   *
   * An example of how this function works is as follows:
   * @code
   *   // A base class. Assume that it has virtual
   *   // functions so that dynamic_cast can work.
   *   class B
   *   {
   *     ...

   *   std::unique_ptr<B> create_object (...)

   *     ...
   *   }
   *
   *   void foo (...)
   *   {
   *     std::unique_ptr<B> b = create_object (...);
   *
   *     // Assume that we know for some reason that the object above must
   *     // have created a D object but returned it as a std::unique_ptr<B>.
   *     // In order to access the D functionality, we need to cast the
   *     // pointer. Use the equivalent to dynamic_cast:
   *     std::unique_ptr<D> d = dynamic_unique_cast<D>(std::move(b));
   *
   *     // If the object really was a D, then 'd' now points to it. Note
   *     // also that in accordance with the semantics of std::unique_ptr,
   *     // it was necessary to std::move the 'b' object, and indeed 'b'
   *     // now no longer points to anything -- ownership has been
   *     // transferred to 'd'!
   * @endcode
   *
   * @note This function does not try to convert the `Deleter` objects stored
   *   by `std::unique_ptr` objects. The function therefore only works if the
   *   deleter objects are at their defaults, i.e., if they are of type
   *   `std::default_delete<To>` and `std::default_delete<From>`.

     * meant to be separate aren't recognized as such just because they happen
     * on the same communicator. In addition, it is conceivable that some MPI
     * operations can be parallelized using multiple threads because their
     * communicators identifies the communication in question, not their
