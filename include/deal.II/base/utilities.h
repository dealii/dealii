     * their work, and the next %parallel operation happens to be a sync on a
     * different matrix, then the sync could succeed -- by accident, since
     * different processors are talking about different matrices.
     *
     * This kind of situation can be avoided if we use different communicators
     * for different matrices which reduces the likelihood that communications
     * meant to be separate aren't recognized as such just because they happen
     * on the same communicator. In addition, it is conceivable that some MPI
     * operations can be parallelized using multiple threads because their
     * communicators identifies the communication in question, not their
     * relative timing as is the case in a sequential program that just uses a
