   * element, so this function calls the given function object on sub-ranges.
   * In other words: if the given range <code>[begin,end)</code> is smaller
   * than grainsize or if multithreading is not enabled, then we call
   * <code>f(begin,end)</code>; otherwise, we may execute, possibly in
   * %parallel, a sequence of calls <code>f(b,e)</code> where

   * collection of calls we do to <code>f(.,.)</code> will happen on disjoint

   *   }

   *
   * Note how we use the <code>std_cxx11::bind</code> function to convert
   * <code>mat_vec_on_subranged</code> from a function that takes 5 arguments
   * to one taking 2 by binding the remaining arguments (the modifiers
   * <code>std_cxx11::ref</code> and <code>std_cxx11::cref</code> make sure
   * that the enclosed variables are actually passed by reference and constant
   * reference, rather than by value). The resulting function object requires
   * only two arguments, begin_row and end_row, with all other arguments
   * fixed.
   *
   * The code, if in single-thread mode, will call
   * <code>mat_vec_on_subranges</code> on the entire range
   * <code>[0,n_rows)</code> exactly once. In multi-threaded mode, however, it
   * may be called multiple times on subranges of this interval, possibly
   * allowing more than one CPU core to take care of part of the work.

  /**
   * This is a class specialized to for loops with a fixed range given by

   * for loop in parallel, subdividing the work onto available processor cores
   * whenever there is enough work to be done (i.e., the number of elements is
   * larger than grain_size). Inside the function, a virtual function
   * apply_to_subrange specifying a range of two integers <tt>[lower,
   * upper)</tt> is called which needs to be defined in a derived class.
   *
   * The parallelization cases covered by this class are a subset of what is
   * possible with the function apply_to_subranges (which also covers the case
   * of more general iterators that might not be described by an integer
   * range). However, for simple integer ranges one might prefer this class,
   * like when there are many structurally similar loops, e.g., some simple
   * copy or arithmetic operations on an array of pointers. In that case,
   * apply_to_subranges will generate a lot of code (or rather, a lot of
   * symbols) because it passes the long names generated by std::bind to the
   * templated parallel for functions in TBB. This can considerably increase
   * compile times and the size of the object code. Similarly, the incorrect
   * use of std::bind often results in very cryptic error messages, which can
   * be avoided by this class (only a virtual function needs to be defined in
   * a derived class). Finally, the additional cost of a virtual function is
   * negligible in the context of parallel functions: It is much more
   * expensive to actually issue the work onto a thread, which in turn should
   * be much less than the actual work done in the for loop.

   * This function works a lot like the apply_to_subranges(), but it allows to
   * accumulate numerical results computed on each subrange into one number.
   * The type of this number is given by the ResultType template argument that
   * needs to be explicitly specified.
   *
   * An example of use of this function is to compute the value of the
   * expression $x^T A x$ for a square matrix $A$ and a vector $x$. The sum
   * over rows can be parallelized and the whole code might look like this:
   * @code
   *   void matrix_norm (const FullMatrix &A,
   *                     const Vector     &x)
   *   {

   *                          std_cxx11::cref(A),
   *                          std_cxx11::cref(x)),
   *         50);
   *   }
   *
   *   double
   *   mat_norm_sqr_on_subranges (const unsigned int begin_row,
   *                              const unsigned int end_row,
   *                              const FullMatrix &A,
   *                              const Vector     &x)
   *   {
   *     double norm_sqr = 0;
   *     for (unsigned int row=begin_row; row!=end_row; ++row)
   *       for (unsigned int col=0; col<x.size(); ++col)
   *         norm_sqr += x(row) * A(row,col) * x(col);
   *     return norm_sqr;
   *   }
   * @endcode
   *
   * Here, <code>mat_norm_sqr_on_subranges</code> is called on the entire
   * range <code>[0,A.n_rows())</code> if this range is less than the minimum
   * grainsize (above chosen as 50) or if deal.II is configured to not use
   * multithreading. Otherwise, it may be called on subsets of the given
   * range, with results from the individual subranges accumulated internally.
   *
   * @warning If ResultType is a floating point type, then accumulation is not
   * an associative operation. In other words, if the given function object is
   * called three times on three subranges, returning values $a,b,c$, then the
   * returned result of this function is $(a+b)+c$. However, depending on how
   * the three sub-tasks are distributed on available CPU resources, the
   * result may also be $(a+c)+b$ or any other permutation; because floating
   * point addition is not associative (as opposed, of course, to addition of
   * real %numbers), the result of invoking this function several times may
   * differ on the order of round-off.
   *
   * For a discussion of the kind of problems to which this function is
   * applicable, see also the
   * @ref threads "Parallel computing with multiple processors"
   * module.
