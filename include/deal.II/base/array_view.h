/**
 * A class that represents a window of memory locations of type @p ElementType
 * and presents it as if it was an array that can be accessed via an
 * <code>operator[]</code>. In essence, this class is nothing more than just a
 * pointer to the first location and an integer that represents the length of
 * the array in elements. The memory remains owned by whoever allocated it, as
 * this class does not take over ownership.
 *
 * The advantage of using this class is that you don't have to pass around
 * pairs of pointers and that <code>operator[]</code> checks for the validity
 * of the index with which you subscript this array view.
 *
 * This class can handle views to both non-constant and constant memory
 * locations. If you want to represent a view of a constant array, then the
 * template argument type of this class needs to be @p const as well. The
 * following code snippet gives an example:
 * @code
 *   std::vector<int>       array       = get_data();  // a writable array
 *
 *   ArrayView<int> view (&array[5], 5);               // a view of elements 5..9 (inclusive)
 *   view[2] = 42;                                     // array[7] is set to 42
 *
 *   ArrayView<const int> const_view (&array[5], 5);   // same view, but read-only
 *   int element_7 = const_view[2];                    // returns 42
 *   const_view[2] = 42;                               // error, can't write into this view
 * @endcode
 * In either case, accessing an element of a view does not change the
 * ArrayView object itself, and consequently ArrayView::operator[] is a @p
 * const function. This corresponds to the notion that a view simply
 * represents a, well, "view" of memory that is owned by someone else. Thus,
 * accessing elements of the view changes the memory managed by some other
 * object, but not the view itself, allowing us to make ArrayView::operator[]
 * a @p const member function. This is in contrast to, say, std::vector, which
 * manages the memory it points to and changing an element of the std::vector
 * therefore changes the std::vector object itself -- consequently, the
 * std::vector::operator[] is non-@p const.
