/**
 * A class that simplifies the process of execution logging. It does so by
 * providing
 * <ul>
 * <li> a push and pop mechanism for prefixes, and
 * <li> the possibility of distributing information to files and the console.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The usual usage of this class is through the pregenerated object
 * <tt>deallog</tt>. Typical setup steps are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <tt>deallog.depth_console(n)</tt>: restrict output on screen to outer
 * loops.
 * <li> <tt>deallog.attach(std::ostream)</tt>: write logging information into
 * a file.
 * <li> <tt>deallog.depth_file(n)</tt>: restrict output to file to outer
 * loops.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Before entering a new phase of your program, e.g. a new loop, a new prefix
 * can be set via <tt>LogStream::Prefix p("loopname");</tt>. The destructor of
 * the prefix will pop the prefix text from the stack.
 *
 * Writes via the <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> operator, <tt> deallog << "This is a log
 * notice";</tt> will be buffered thread locally until a <tt>std::flush</tt>
 * or <tt>std::endl</tt> is encountered, which will trigger a writeout to the
 * console and, if set up, the log file.
 *
 * <h3>LogStream and thread safety</h3>
 *
 * In the vicinity of concurrent threads, LogStream behaves in the following
 * manner:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Every write to a Logstream with operator <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> (or with
 * one of the special member functions) is buffered in a thread-local storage.
 * <li> An <tt>std::flush</tt> or <tt>std::endl</tt> will trigger a writeout
 * to the console and (if attached) to the file stream. This writeout is
 * sequentialized so that output from concurrent threads don't interleave.
 * <li> On a new thread, invoking a writeout, as well as a call to #push or
 * #pop will copy the current prefix of the "blessed" thread that created the
 * LogStream instance to a thread-local storage. After that prefixes are
 * thread-local.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>LogStream and reproducible regression test output</h3>
 *
 * Generating reproducible floating point output for regression tests is
 * mildly put a nightmare. In order to make life a little easier, LogStream
 * implements a few features that try to achieve such a goal. These features
 * are turned on by calling test_mode(), and it is not recommended to use them
 * in any other environment. Right now, LogStream implements the following:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> A double number very close to zero will end up being output in
 * exponential format, although it has no significant digits. The parameter
 * #double_threshold determines which numbers are too close to zero to be
 * considered nonzero.
 * <li> For float numbers holds the same, but with a typically larger
 * #float_threshold.
 * <li> Rounded numbers become unreliable with inexact arithmetics. Therefore,
 * adding a small number before rounding makes results more reproducible,
 * assuming that numbers like 0.5 are more likely than 0.49997.
 * </ol>
 * It should be pointed out that all of these measures distort the output and
 * make it less accurate. Therefore, they are only recommended if the output
 * needs to be reproducible.
