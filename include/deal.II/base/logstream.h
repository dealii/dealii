/**
 * A class that simplifies the process of execution logging. It does so by
 * providing
 * <ul>
 * <li> a push and pop mechanism for prefixes, and
 * <li> the possibility of distributing information to files and the console.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The usual usage of this class is through the pregenerated object
 * <tt>deallog</tt>. Typical setup steps are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <tt>deallog.depth_console(n)</tt>: restrict output on screen to outer
 * loops.
 * <li> <tt>deallog.attach(std::ostream)</tt>: write logging information into
 * a file.
 * <li> <tt>deallog.depth_file(n)</tt>: restrict output to file to outer
 * loops.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Before entering a new phase of your program, e.g. a new loop, a new prefix
 * can be set via <tt>LogStream::Prefix p("loopname");</tt>. The destructor of
 * the prefix will pop the prefix text from the stack.
 *
 * Write via the <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> operator, <tt> deallog << "This is a log
 * notice";</tt> will be buffered thread locally until a <tt>std::flush</tt>
 * or <tt>std::endl</tt> is encountered, which will trigger a writeout to the
 * console and, if set up, the log file.
 *
 * <h3>LogStream and thread safety</h3>
 *
 * In the vicinity of concurrent threads, LogStream behaves in the following
 * manner:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Every write to a Logstream with operator <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> (or with
 * one of the special member functions) is buffered in a thread-local storage.
 * <li> An <tt>std::flush</tt> or <tt>std::endl</tt> will trigger a writeout
 * to the console and (if attached) to the file stream. This writeout is
 * sequentialized so that output from concurrent threads don't interleave.
 * <li> On a new thread, invoking a writeout, as well as a call to #push or
 * #pop will copy the current prefix of the "blessed" thread that created the
 * LogStream instance to a thread-local storage. After that prefixes are
 * thread-local.
 * </ul>

  /**
   * A subclass allowing for the safe generation and removal of prefixes.
   *
   * Somewhere at the beginning of a block, create one of these objects, and
   * it will appear as a prefix in LogStream output like @p deallog. At the
   * end of the block, the prefix will automatically be removed, when this
   * object is destroyed.
   *
   * In other words, the scope of the object so created determines the
   * lifetime of the prefix. The advantage of using such an object is that the
   * prefix is removed whichever way you exit the scope -- by
   * <code>continue</code>, <code>break</code>, <code>return</code>,
   * <code>throw</code>, or by simply reaching the closing brace. In all of
   * these cases, it is not necessary to remember to pop the prefix manually
   * using LogStream::pop(). In this, it works just like the better known
   * std::unique_ptr and std::lock_guard classes.
