/**
 * Tensor product of given polynomials.
 *
 * Given a vector of <i>n</i> one-dimensional polynomials <i>P<sub>1</sub></i>
 * to <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>, this class generates <i>n<sup>dim</sup></i>
 * polynomials of the form <i>Q<sub>ijk</sub>(x,y,z) =
 * P<sub>i</sub>(x)P<sub>j</sub>(y)P<sub>k</sub>(z)</i>. If the base
 * polynomials are mutually orthogonal on the interval [-1,1] or [0,1], then
 * the tensor product polynomials are orthogonal on [-1,1]<sup>dim</sup> or
 * [0,1]<sup>dim</sup>, respectively.
 *
 * Indexing is as follows: the order of dim-dimensional polynomials is
 * x-coordinates running fastest, then y-coordinate, etc. The first few
 * polynomials are thus <i>P<sub>1</sub>(x)P<sub>1</sub>(y),
 * P<sub>2</sub>(x)P<sub>1</sub>(y), P<sub>3</sub>(x)P<sub>1</sub>(y), ...,
 * P<sub>1</sub>(x)P<sub>2</sub>(y), P<sub>2</sub>(x)P<sub>2</sub>(y),
 * P<sub>3</sub>(x)P<sub>2</sub>(y), ...</i> and likewise in 3d.
 *
 * The output_indices() function prints the ordering of the dim-dimensional
 * polynomials, i.e. for each polynomial in the polynomial space it gives the
 * indices i,j,k of the one-dimensional polynomials in x,y and z direction.
 * The ordering of the dim-dimensional polynomials can be changed by using the
 * set_numbering() function.
