/**
 * A class that represents a point in a space with arbitrary dimension
 * <tt>dim</tt>.
 *
 * Objects of this class are used to represent points, i.e., vectors anchored
 * at the origin of a Cartesian vector space. They are, among other uses,
 * passed to functions that operate on points in spaces of a priori fixed
 * dimension: rather than using functions like <tt>double f(double x)</tt> and
 * <tt>double f(double x, double y)</tt>, you should use <tt>double
 * f(Point<dim> &p)</tt> instead as it allows writing dimension independent
 * code.
 *
 *
 * <h3>What's a <code>Point@<dim@></code> and what is a
 * <code>Tensor@<1,dim@></code>?</h3>
 *
 * The Point class is derived from Tensor@<1,dim@> and consequently shares the
 * latter's member functions and other attributes. In fact, it has relatively
 * few additional functions itself (the most notable exception being the
 * distance() function to compute the Euclidean distance between two points in
 * space), and these two classes can therefore often be used interchangeably.
 *
 * Nonetheless, there are semantic differences that make us use these classes
 * in different and well-defined contexts. Within deal.II, we use the
 * <tt>Point</tt> class to denote points in space, i.e., for vectors (rank-1
 * tensors) that are <em>anchored at the origin</em>. On the other hand,
 * vectors that are anchored elsewhere (and consequently do not represent
 * <em>points</em> in the common usage of the word) are represented by objects
 * of type Tensor@<1,dim@>. In particular, this is the case for direction
 * vectors, normal vectors, gradients, and the differences between two points
 * (i.e., what you get when you subtract one point from another): all of these
 * are represented by Tensor@<1,dim@> objects rather than Point@<dim@>.
 *
 * Furthermore, the Point class is only used where the coordinates of an
 * object can be thought to possess the dimension of a length. An object that
 * represents the weight, height, and cost of an object is neither a point nor
 * a tensor (because it lacks the transformation properties under rotation of
 * the coordinate system) and should consequently not be represented by either
 * of these classes. Use an array of size 3 in this case, or the
 * <code>std_cxx11::array</code> class. Alternatively, as in the case of
 * vector-valued functions, you can use objects of type Vector or
 * <code>std::vector</code>.
 *
 *
 * @tparam dim An integer that denotes the dimension of the space in which a
 * point lies. This of course equals the number of coordinates that identify a
 * point.
 * @tparam Number The data type in which the coordinates values are to be
 * stored. This will, in almost all cases, simply be the default @p double,
 * but there are cases where one may want to store coordinates in a different
 * (and always scalar) type. An example would be an interval type that can
 * store the value of a coordinate as well as its uncertainty. Another example
 * would be a type that allows for Automatic Differentiation (see, for
 * example, the Sacado type used in step-33) and thereby can generate analytic
 * (spatial) derivatives of a function when passed a Point object whose
 * coordinates are stored in such a type.
