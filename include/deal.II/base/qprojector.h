/**
 * This class is a helper class to facilitate the usage of quadrature formulae
 * on faces or subfaces of cells. It computes the locations of quadrature
 * points on the unit cell from a quadrature object for a manifold of one
 * dimension less than that of the cell and the number of the face. For
 * example, giving the Simpson rule in one dimension and using the
 * project_to_face() function with face number 1, the returned points will be
 * (1,0), (1,0.5) and (1,1). Note that faces have an orientation, so when
 * projecting to face 3, you will get (0,0), (0,0.5) and (0,1), which is in
 * clockwise sense, while for face 1 the points were in counterclockwise
 * sense.
 *
 * For the projection to subfaces (i.e. to the children of a face of the unit
 * cell), the same applies as above. Note the order in which the children of a
 * face are numbered, which in two dimensions coincides with the orientation
 * of the face.
 *
 * The second set of functions generates a quadrature formula by projecting a
 * given quadrature rule on <b>all</b> faces and subfaces. This is used in the
 * FEFaceValues and FESubfaceValues classes. Since we now have the quadrature
 * points of all faces and subfaces in one array, we need to have a way to
 * find the starting index of the points and weights corresponding to one face
 * or subface within this array. This is done through the DataSetDescriptor
 * member class.
 *
 * The different functions are grouped into a common class to avoid putting
 * them into global namespace. However, since they have no local data, all
 * functions are declared <tt>static</tt> and can be called without creating
 * an object of this class.
 *
 * For the 3d case, you should note that the orientation of faces is even more
 * intricate than for two dimensions. Quadrature formulae are projected upon
 * the faces in their standard orientation, not to the inside or outside of
 * the hexahedron. To make things more complicated, in 3d we allow faces in
 * two orientations (which can be identified using
 * <tt>cell->face_orientation(face)</tt>), so we have to project quadrature
 * formula onto faces and subfaces in two orientations. (Refer to the
 * documentation of the Triangulation class for a description of the
 * orientation of the different faces, as well as to
 * @ref GlossFaceOrientation "the glossary entry on face orientation"
 * for more information on this.) The DataSetDescriptor member class is used
 * to identify where each dataset starts.
