/**
 * @brief Class which transforms `dim - 1`-dimensional quadrature rules to
 * `dim`-dimensional face quadratures.
 *
 * The majority of the finite element infrastructure, such as FE_Q and
 * FE_SimplexP, uses polynomials defined on a reference cell: for example,
 * FE_Q<3> defines a polynomial space whose domain is the unit hexahedron (i.e.,
 * ReferenceCells::Hexahedron). Hence, computing quadratures using shape
 * functions on a face of a reference cell requires converting a
 * lower-dimensional Quadrature into one defined on the boundary of the
 * higher-dimensional object, e.g., converting a Quadrature defined on a
 * quadrilateral into one defined on one face of a hexahedron.
 *
 * QProjector computes the locations of quadrature points on faces or subfaces
 * of reference cells from a Quadrature of one dimension less than that of the
 * cell, face (and possibly also subface) number, and orientation. For example,
 * calling QProjector::project_to_face() with QSimpson<1>, face number 1, and
 * numbers::default_geometric_orientation returns a Quadrature with points
 * (1,0), (1,0.5), and (1,1) with weights equal to the 1d case. Similarly, if we
 * instead use face 3 and numbers::reverse_line_orientation we obtain points
 * (1,1), (0.5,1) and (0,1). Projection to subfaces works in the same way.
 *
 * In practice, computing face integrals (e.g., via FEFaceValues or
 * FESubfaceValues) requires quadrature rules for all possible permutations of
 * face number, subface number, and orientation. This class provides several
 * functions for doing just that, such as QProjector::project_to_all_faces().
 * Furthermore, the DataSetDescriptor class implements indexing for converting
 * between face number, subface number, and orientation to the index of the
 * associated Quadrature rule.
