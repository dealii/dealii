     * algorithm). The function creates partitions that contain "zones" of
     * iterators where the first partition contains the first iterator, the

     * single element in the first zone, the third zone contains those
     * iterators that have conflicts with the iterators of the second zone and
     * have not previously been assigned to a zone, etc. If the iterators
     * represent cells, then this generates partitions that are like onion
     * shells around the very first cell. Note that elements in each zone may
     * conflict with other elements in the same zone.
     *
     * The question whether two iterators conflict is determined by a user-
     * provided function. The meaning of this function is discussed in the
     * documentation of the GraphColoring::make_graph_coloring() function.
     *
     * @param[in] begin The first element of a range of iterators for which a

     * returning a set of indicators that are descriptive of what represents a

  /**
   * Create a partitioning of the given range of iterators so that iterators
   * that point to conflicting objects will be placed into different
   * partitions, where the question whether two objects conflict is determined
   * by a user-provided function.
   *
   * This function can also be considered as a graph coloring: each object
   * pointed to by an iterator is considered to be a node and there is an edge
   * between each two nodes that conflict. The graph coloring algorithm then
   * assigns a color to each node in such a way that two nodes connected by an
   * edge do not have the same color.
   *
   * A typical use case for this function is in assembling a matrix in
   * parallel. There, one would like to assemble local contributions on
   * different cells at the same time (an operation that is purely local and
   * so requires no synchronization) but then we need to add these local
   * contributions to the global matrix. In general, the contributions from
   * different cells may be to the same matrix entries if the cells share
   * degrees of freedom and, consequently, can not happen at the same time
   * unless we want to risk a race condition (see
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). Thus, we call these two
   * cells in conflict, and we can only allow operations in parallel from
   * cells that do not conflict. In other words, two cells are in conflict if
   * the set of matrix entries (for example characterized by the rows) have a
   * nonempty intersection.
   *
   * In this generality, computing the graph of conflicts would require
   * calling a function that determines whether two iterators (or the two
   * objects they represent) conflict, and calling it for every pair of
   * iterators, i.e., $\frac 12 N (N-1)$ times. This is too expensive in
   * general. A better approach is to require a user-defined function that
   * returns for every iterator it is called for a set of indicators of some
   * kind that characterize a conflict; two iterators are in conflict if their
   * conflict indicator sets have a nonempty intersection. In the example of
   * assembling a matrix, the conflict indicator set would contain the indices
   * of all degrees of freedom on the cell pointed to (in the case of
   * continuous Galerkin methods) or the union of indices of degree of freedom
   * on the current cell and all cells adjacent to the faces of the current
   * cell (in the case of discontinuous Galerkin methods, because there one
   * computes face integrals coupling the degrees of freedom connected by a
   * common face -- see step-12).
   *
   * @note The conflict set returned by the user defined function passed as
   * third argument needs to accurately describe <i>all</i> degrees of freedom
   * for which anything is written into the matrix or right hand side. In
   * other words, if the writing happens through a function like
   * ConstraintMatrix::copy_local_to_global(), then the set of conflict
   * indices must actually contain not only the degrees of freedom on the
   * current cell, but also those they are linked to by constraints such as
   * hanging nodes.
   *
   * In other situations, the conflict indicator sets may represent something
   * different altogether -- it is up to the caller of this function to
   * describe what it means for two iterators to conflict. Given this,
   * computing conflict graph edges can be done significantly more cheaply
   * than with ${\cal O}(N^2)$ operations.
   *
   * In any case, the result of the function will be so that iterators whose
   * conflict indicator sets have overlap will not be assigned to the same
   * color.
   *
   * @note The algorithm used in this function is described in a paper by
   * Turcksin, Kronbichler and Bangerth, see
   * @ref workstream_paper.
   *
   * @param[in] begin The first element of a range of iterators for which a
   * coloring is sought.
   * @param[in] end The element past the end of the range of iterators.
   * @param[in] get_conflict_indices A user defined function object returning
   * a set of indicators that are descriptive of what represents a conflict.
   * See above for a more thorough discussion.
   * @return A set of sets of iterators (where sets are represented by
   * std::vector for efficiency). Each element of the outermost set
   * corresponds to the iterators pointing to objects that are in the same
   * partition (have the same color) and consequently do not conflict. The
   * elements of different sets may conflict.
