   * number of threads equal to the number of cores allocated to this MPI
   * process. However, MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit() in turn also

   * cores each process may access to one or a subset of cores in order to
   * ensure better cache behavior. Consequently, the number of threads
   * that will really be created will be the minimum of the argument
   * passed here, the environment variable (if set), and the number of
   * cores accessible to the thread.
   *
   * @note MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit() can only work if it is
   * called before any threads are created. The safest place for a call to
   * it is therefore at the beginning of <code>main()</code>.
   * Consequently, this extends to the current class: the best place to
   * create an object of this type is also at or close to the top of
