 * The Timer class provides a way to measure both the amount of wall time
 * (i.e., the amount of time elapsed on a wall clock) and the amount of CPU
 * time that certain sections of an application have used. This class also
 * offers facilities for synchronizing the elapsed time across an MPI
 * communicator.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * The Timer class can be started and stopped several times. It stores both
 * the amount of time elapsed over the last start-stop cycle, or <em>lap</em>,
 * as well as the total time elapsed over all laps. Here is an example:
 *
 * @code
 *   Timer timer; // creating a timer also starts it
 *
 *   // do some complicated computations here
 *   // ...
 *
 *   timer.stop();
 *
 *   std::cout << "Elapsed CPU time: " << timer.cpu_time() << " seconds.\n";
 *   std::cout << "Elapsed wall time: " << timer.wall_time() << " seconds.\n";
 *
 *   // reset timer for the next thing it shall do
 *   timer.reset();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, you can also restart the timer instead of resetting it. The
 * times between successive calls to start() and stop() (i.e., the laps) will
 * then be accumulated. The usage of this class is also explained in the
 * step-28 tutorial program.
 *
 * @note The TimerOutput (combined with TimerOutput::Scope) class provide a
 * convenient way to time multiple named sections and summarize the output.
 *
 * @note Implementation of this class is system dependent. In particular, CPU
 * times are accumulated from summing across all threads and will usually
 * exceed the wall times.

// TODO: The following class is not thread-safe
/**
 * This class can be used to generate formatted output from time measurements
 * of different subsections in a program. It is possible to create several
 * sections that perform certain aspects of the program. A section can be
 * entered several times. By changing the options in OutputFrequency and
 * OutputType, the user can choose whether output should be generated every
 * time a section is joined or just in the end of the program. Moreover, it is
 * possible to show CPU times, wall times or both.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Use of this class could be as follows:
 * @code
 *   TimerOutput timer (std::cout, TimerOutput::summary,
 *                      TimerOutput::wall_times);
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Setup dof system");
 *   setup_dofs();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Assemble");
 *   assemble_system_1();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Solve");
 *   solve_system_1();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Assemble");
 *   assemble_system_2();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Solve");
 *   solve_system_2();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   // do something else...
 * @endcode
 * When run, this program will return an output like this:
 * @code
 * +---------------------------------------------+------------+------------+
 * | Total wallclock time elapsed since start    |      88.8s |            |
 * |                                             |            |            |
 * | Section                         | no. calls |  wall time | % of total |
 * +---------------------------------+-----------+------------+------------+
 * | Assemble                        |         2 |      19.7s |        22% |
 * | Solve                           |         2 |      3.03s |       3.4% |
 * | Setup dof system                |         1 |      3.97s |       4.5% |
 * +---------------------------------+-----------+------------+------------+
 * @endcode
 * The output will see that we entered the assembly and solve section twice,
 * and reports how much time we spent there. Moreover, the class measures the
 * total time spent from start to termination of the TimerOutput object. In
 * this case, we did a lot of other stuff, so that the time proportions of the
 * functions we measured are far away from 100 percent.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Using scoped timers</h3>
 *
 * The scheme above where you have to have calls to
 * TimerOutput::enter_subsection() and TimerOutput::leave_subsection() is
 * awkward if the sections in between these calls contain <code>return</code>
 * statements or may throw exceptions. In that case, it is easy to forget that
 * one nevertheless needs to leave the section somehow, somewhere. An easier
 * approach is to use "scoped" sections. This is a variable that when you
 * create it enters a section, and leaves the section when you destroy it. If
 * this is a variable local to a particular scope (a code block between curly
 * braces) and you leave this scope due to a <code>return</code> statements or
 * an exception, then the variable is destroyed and the timed section is left
 * automatically. Consequently, we could have written the code piece above as
 * follows, with exactly the same result but now exception-safe:
 * @code
 *   TimerOutput timer (std::cout, TimerOutput::summary,
 *                      TimerOutput::wall_times);
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Setup dof system");
 *     setup_dofs();
 *   }
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Assemble");
 *     assemble_system_1();
 *   }
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Solve");
 *     solve_system_1();
 *   }
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Assemble");
 *     assemble_system_2();
 *   }
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Solve");
 *     solve_system_2();
 *   }
 *
 *   // do something else...
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage in parallel programs using MPI</h3>
 *
 * In a parallel program built on MPI, using the class in a way such as the
 * one shown above would result in a situation where each process times the
 * corresponding sections and then outputs the resulting timing information at
 * the end. This is annoying since you'd get a lot of output -- one set of
 * timing information from each processor.
 *
 * This can be avoided by only letting one processor generate screen output,
 * typically by using an object of type ConditionalOStream instead of
 * <code>std::cout</code> to write to screen (see, for example, step-17,
 * step-18, step-32 and step-40, all of which use this method).
 *
 * This way, only a single processor outputs timing information, typically the
 * first process in the MPI universe. However, if you take the above code
 * snippet as an example, imagine what would happen if
 * <code>setup_dofs()</code> is fast on processor zero and slow on at least
 * one of the other processors; and if the first thing
 * <code>assemble_system_1()</code> does is something that requires all
 * processors to communicate. In this case, on processor zero, the timing
 * section with name <code>"Setup dof system"</code> will yield a short run
 * time on processor zero, whereas the section <code> "Assemble"</code> will
 * take a long time: not because <code>assemble_system_1()</code> takes a
 * particularly long time, but because on the processor on which we time (or,
 * rather, the one on which we generate output) happens to have to wait for a
 * long time till the other processor is finally done with
 * <code>setup_dofs()</code> and starts to participate in
 * <code>assemble_system_1()</code>. In other words, the timing that is
 * reported is unreliable because it reflects run times from other processors.
 * Furthermore, the run time of this section on processor zero has nothing to
 * do with the run time of the section on other processors but instead with
 * the run time of <i>the previous section</i> on another processor.
 *
 * The first way to avoid this is to introduce a barrier into the parallel
 * code just before we start and stop timing sections. This ensures that all
 * processes are at the same place and the timing information then reflects
 * the maximal run time across all processors. To achieve this, you need to
 * initialize the TimerOutput object with an MPI communicator object, for
 * example as in the following code:
 * @code
 *   TimerOutput timer (MPI_COMM_WORLD,
 *                      pcout,
 *                      TimerOutput::summary,
 *                      TimerOutput::wall_times);
 * @endcode
 * Here, <code>pcout</code> is an object of type ConditionalOStream that makes
 * sure that we only generate output on a single processor. See the step-32,
 * step-40, and step-42 tutorial programs for this kind of usage of this class.
 *
 * The second variant to cope with this issue is print more information about
 * the recorded times to be able to understand this kind of imbalances without
 * actually adding the barriers. While this approach is still affected by
 * imbalances between different MPI processes, its output is not the arbitrary
 * time of rank 0, but the minimum, average and maximum of the MPI results,
 * using information from Utilities::MPI::MinMaxAvg. As the data is also
 * equipped with the rank id where the minimum and maximum are attained, this
 * approach allows to identify on which ranks certain slowdowns occur. In case
 * some imbalance between the MPI ranks from one section to the next can be
 * tolerated, this strategy can hence be advantageous over the barrier variant
 * as it does not synchronize the program in places where it is not necessary,
 * and rather tries to display the imbalance observed in various phases. In
 * order to use this variant initialize the output object without any native
 * print settings and without communicator,
 * @code
 *   TimerOutput timer (pcout,
 *                      TimerOutput::never,
 *                      TimerOutput::wall_times);
 * @endcode
 * and then call
 * @code
 *   timer.print_wall_time_statistics(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
 * @endcode
 * where appropriate. Here, the output is written to the <code>pcout</code>
 * object of type ConditionalOStream passed to the constructor, making sure
 * the information is only printed once. See step-67 for an example usage of
 * this variant. Besides the basic minimum, average, and maximum of times over
 * all MPI ranks, the TimerOutput::print_wall_time_statistics() function also
 * takes a second argument to specify output of quantiles, e.g., the time
 * taken by the 10\% of the slowest and fastest ranks, respectively, to get
 * additional insight into the statistical distribution.
