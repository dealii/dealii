/**
 * This is a very simple class which provides information about both the CPU
 * time and the wallclock time elapsed since the timer was started last
 * time. Information is retrieved from the system on the basis of clock cycles
 * since last time the computer was booted for the CPU time. The wall time is
 * based on the system clock accessed by @p gettimeofday, with a typical
 * accuracy of 0.01 ms on linux systems.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Use of this class is as you might expect by looking at the member
 * functions:
 * @code
 *   Timer timer;
 *   timer.start ();
 *
 *   // do some complicated computations here
 *   ...
 *
 *   timer.stop ();
 *
 *   std::cout << "Elapsed CPU time: " << timer() << " seconds.";
 *   std::cout << "Elapsed wall time: " << timer.wall_time() << " seconds.";
 *
 *   // reset timer for the next thing it shall do
 *   timer.reset();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively, you can also restart the timer instead of resetting
 * it. The times between successive calls to start() / stop() will then be
 * accumulated. The usage of this class is also explained in the
 * step-28, step-29 and step-30 tutorial programs.
 *
 * @note Implementation of this class is system dependent. In case
 * multithreaded routines (matrix-vector products, error estimators, etc.) are
 * used, the CPU time is accumulated from all the children.

//TODO: The following class is not thread-safe
/**
 * This class can be used to generate formatted output from time
 * measurements of different subsections in a program. It is possible to
 * create several sections that perform certain aspects of the program. A
 * section can be entered several times. By changing the options in
 * OutputFrequency and OutputType, the user can choose whether output should
 * be generated every time a section is joined or just in the end of the
 * program. Moreover, it is possible to show CPU times, wall times or both.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Use of this class could be as follows:
 * @code
 *   TimerOutput timer (std::cout, TimerOutput::summary,
 *                      TimerOutput::wall_times);
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Setup dof system");
 *   setup_dofs();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Assemble");
 *   assemble_system_1();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Solve");
 *   solve_system_1();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Assemble");
 *   assemble_system_2();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   timer.enter_subsection ("Solve");
 *   solve_system_2();
 *   timer.leave_subsection();
 *
 *   // do something else...
 * @endcode
 * When run, this program will return an output like this:
 * @code
 * +---------------------------------------------+------------+------------+
 * | Total wallclock time elapsed since start    |      88.8s |            |
 * |                                             |            |            |
 * | Section                         | no. calls |  wall time | % of total |
 * +---------------------------------+-----------+------------+------------+
 * | Assemble                        |         2 |      19.7s |        22% |
 * | Solve                           |         2 |      3.03s |       3.4% |
 * | Setup dof system                |         1 |      3.97s |       4.5% |
 * +---------------------------------+-----------+------------+------------+
 * @endcode
 * The output will see that we entered the assembly and solve section
 * twice, and reports how much time we spent there. Moreover, the class
 * measures the total time spent from start to termination of the TimerOutput
 * object. In this case, we did a lot of other stuff, so that the time
 * proportions of the functions we measured are far away from 100 precent.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Using scoped timers</h3>
 *
 * The scheme above where you have to have calls to
 * TimerOutput::enter_subsection() and TimerOutput::leave_subsection() is
 * awkward if the sections in between these calls contain <code>return</code>
 * statements or may throw exceptions. In that case, it is easy to forget that
 * one nevertheless needs to leave the section somehow, somewhere. An easier
 * approach is to use "scoped" sections. This is a variable that when you create
 * it enters a section, and leaves the section when you destroy it. If this is
 * a variable local to a particular scope (a code block between curly braces)
 * and you leave this scope due to a <code>return</code> statements or an
 * exception, then the variable is destroyed and the timed section is left
 * automatically. Consequently, we could have written the code piece above
 * as follows, with exactly the same result but now exception-safe:
 * @code
 *   TimerOutput timer (std::cout, TimerOutput::summary,
 *                      TimerOutput::wall_times);
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Setup dof system");
 *     setup_dofs();
 *   }
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Assemble");
 *     assemble_system_1();
 *   }
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Solve");
 *     solve_system_1();
 *   }
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Assemble");
 *     assemble_system_2();
 *   }
 *
 *   {
 *     TimerOutput::Scope timer_section(timer, "Solve");
 *     solve_system_2();
 *   }
 *
 *   // do something else...
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h3>Usage in parallel programs using MPI</h3>
 *
 * In a parallel program built on MPI, using the class in a way such
 * as the one shown above would result in a situation where each
 * process times the corresponding sections and then outputs the resulting
 * timing information at the end. This is annoying since you'd get a lot
 * of output -- one set of timing information from each processor.
 *
 * This can be avoided by only letting one processor generate screen output,
 * typically by using an object of type ConditionalOStream instead of
 * <code>std::cout</code> to write to screen (see, for example, step-17,
 * step-18, step-32 and step-40, all of which use this method).
 *
 * This way, only a single processor outputs timing information, typically
 * the first process in the MPI universe. However,
 * if you take the above code snippet as an example, imagine what would happen
 * if <code>setup_dofs()</code> is fast on processor zero and slow on at
 * least one of the other processors; and if the first thing
 * <code>assemble_system_1()</code> does is something that requires all
 * processors to communicate. In this case, on processor zero, the timing
 * section with name <code>"Setup dof system"</code> will yield a short
 * run time on processor zero, whereas the section <code> "Assemble"</code>
 * will take a long time: not because <code>assemble_system_1()</code>
 * takes a particularly long time, but because on the processor on which
 * we time (or, rather, the one on which we generate output) happens to
 * have to wait for a long time till the other processor is finally done
 * with <code>setup_dofs()</code> and starts to participate in
 * <code>assemble_system_1()</code>. In other words, the timing that is
 * reported is unreliable because it reflects run times from other
 * processors. Furthermore, the run time of this section on processor zero
 * has nothing to do with the run time of the section on other processors
 * but instead with the run time of <i>the previous section</i> on another
 * processor.
 *
 * The usual way to avoid this is to introduce a barrier into the parallel
 * code just before we start and stop timing sections. This ensures that
 * all processes are at the same place and the timing information then
 * reflects the maximal run time across all processors. To achieve this,
 * you need to initialize the TimerOutput object with an MPI communicator
 * object, for example as in the following code:
 * @code
 *   TimerOutput timer (MPI_COMM_WORLD,
 *                      pcout,
 *                      TimerOutput::summary,
 *                      TimerOutput::wall_times);
 * @endcode
 * Here, <code>pcout</code> is an object of type ConditionalOStream that
 * makes sure that we only generate output on a single processor.
 * See the step-32 and step-40 tutorial programs for this kind of usage
 * of this class.
