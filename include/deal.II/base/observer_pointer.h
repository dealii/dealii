/**
 * This class represents an "observer pointer", i.e., it is a pointer class
 * like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`, but it does not participate in
 * managing the lifetime of the object pointed to -- we are simply observing
 * an object passively that is owned by some other entity of the program, but
 * we are not in charge of creating and destroying this object. In particular,
 * the pointer may be pointing to a member variable of another object whose
 * lifetime is not actively managed but is instead tied to the lifetime of
 * the surrounding object of which it is a member.
 *
 * The class does, however, have mechanisms to ensure that the object pointed
 * to remains alive at least as long as the pointer points to -- in other words,
 * unlike a simple C-style `T*` variable, it can avoid the problem of
 * [dangling pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_pointer). In other
 * works, objects of the current type can be used like a regular
 * pointer (i.e., using the `*p` and `p->` operators and
 * through casting), but they make sure that the object pointed to is not
 * deleted or moved from in the course of use of the pointer by signaling the
 * pointee its use. This is achieved by keeping a use count for the pointed-to
 * object (which for this purpose needs to be derived from the
 * EnableObserverPointer class), and ensuring that the pointed-to
 * object's destructor triggers an error if that use-count is larger than zero
 * -- i.e., if there are still observing ObserverPointer objects pointing to it.
 *
 * Conceptually, ObserverPointer fills a gap between `std::unique_ptr` and
 * `std::shared_ptr`. While the former makes it clear that there is a unique
 * owner of an object (namely the scope in which the `std::unique_ptr` resides),
 * it does not allow other places in a code base to point to the object. In
 * contrast, `std::shared_ptr` allows many places to point to the same object,
 * but none of them is the "owner" of the object: They all are, and the last
 * one to stop pointing to the object is responsible for deleting it.
 *
 * ObserverPointer utilizes semantics in which one place owns an object and
 * others can point to it. The owning place is responsible for destroying the
 * object when it is no longer needed, and as mentioned above, this will trigger
 * an error if other places are still pointing to it via ObserverPointer
 * pointers.
 *
 * In practice, using this scheme, if you try to destroy an object to which
 * observers still point via ObserverPointer objects, you will get an error that
 * says that there are still observers of the object and that the object can
 * consequently not be destroyed without creating "dangling" pointers. This
 * is often not very helpful in *finding* where these pointers are. As a
 * consequence, this class also provides two ways to annotate the observer
 * count with information about what other places still observe an object.
 * First, when initializing a ObserverPointer object with the address of the
 * object pointed to, you can also attach a string that describes the
 * observing location, and this string will then be shown in error messages
 * listing all remaining observers. Second, if no such string is provided,
 * the name second template argument `P` is used as the debug string. This
 * allows to encode the observer information in the type of the ObserverPointer.
 *
 * @note Unlike `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, ObserverPointer does
 *   NOT implement any memory handling. In particular, deleting a
 *   ObserverPointer does not delete the object because the semantics
 *   of this class are that it only *observes* an object, but does not
 *   take over ownership. As a consequence, this is a sure way of creating
 *   a memory leak:
 *   @code
 *     ObserverPointer<T> dont_do_this = new T;
 *   @endcode
 *   This is because here, no variable "owns" the object pointed to, and
 *   the destruction of the `dont_do_this` pointer does not trigger the
 *   release of the memory pointed to.
 *
 * @note This class correctly handles `const`-ness of an object, i.e.,
 *   a `ObserverPointer<const T>` really behaves as if it were a pointer
 *   to a constant object (disallowing write access when dereferenced), while
 *   `ObserverPointer<T>` is a mutable pointer.
