/**
 * The TableHandler stores TableEntries of arbitrary value type and writes the
 * table as text or in tex format to an output stream. The value type actually
 * may vary from column to column and from row to row.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * The most important function is the templatized function
 * <code>add_value(const std::string &key, const T value)</code> that adds a
 * column with the name <tt>key</tt> to the table if this column does not yet
 * exist and adds the given value of type <tt>T</tt> (which must be one of
 * <tt>int</tt>, <tt>unsigned int</tt>, <tt>double</tt>, <tt>std::string</tt>)
 * to this column.  After the table is complete there are different
 * possibilities of output, e.g., into a latex file with write_tex() or as
 * text with write_text().
 *
 * Two (or more) columns may be merged into a "supercolumn" by twice (or
 * multiple) calling add_column_to_supercolumn(), see there. Additionally
 * there is a function to set for each column the precision of the output of
 * numbers, and there are several functions to prescribe the format and the
 * captions the columns are written with in tex mode.
 *
 * A detailed explanation of this class is also given in the step-13 tutorial
 * program.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Example</h3>
 *
 * This is a simple example demonstrating the usage of this class. The first
 * column includes the numbers <tt>i=1..n</tt>, the second $1^2$...$n^2$, the
 * third $sqrt(1)...sqrt(n)$, where the second and third columns are merged
 * into one supercolumn with the superkey <tt>squares and roots</tt>.
 * Additionally the first column is aligned to the right (the default was
 * <tt>centered</tt>) and the precision of the square roots are set to be 6
 * (instead of 4 as default).
 *
 * @code
 * TableHandler table;
 *
 * for (unsigned int i=1; i<=n; ++i)
 *   {
 *     table.add_value("numbers", i);
 *     table.add_value("squares", i*i);
 *     table.add_value("square roots", sqrt(i));
 *   }
 *                                  // merge the second and third column
 * table.add_column_to_supercolumn("squares", "squares and roots");
 * table.add_column_to_supercolumn("square roots", "squares and roots");
 *
 *                                  // additional settings
 * table.set_tex_format("numbers", "r");
 * table.set_precision("square roots", 6);
 *
 *                                  // output
 * std::ofstream out_file("number_table.tex");
 * table.write_tex(out_file);
 * out_file.close();
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h3>Dealing with sparse data: auto-fill mode</h3>
 *
 * When generating output, TableHandler expects that all columns have the
 * exact same number of elements in it so that the result is in fact a table.
 * This assumes that in each of the iterations (time steps, nonlinear
 * iterations, etc) you fill every single column. On the other hand, this may
 * not always be what you want to do. For example, it could be that the
 * function that computes the nonlinear residual is only called every few time
 * steps; or, a function computing statistics of the mesh is only called
 * whenever the mesh is in fact refined. In these cases, the add_value()
 * function will be called less often for some columns and the column would
 * therefore have fewer elements; furthermore, these elements would not be
 * aligned with the rows that contain the other data elements that were
 * produced during this iteration. An entirely different scenario is that the
 * table is filled and at a later time we use the data in there to compute the
 * elements of other rows; the ConvergenceTable class does something like
 * this.
 *
 * To support both scenarios, the TableHandler class has a property called <i
 * >auto-fill mode</i>. By default, auto-fill mode is off, but it can be
 * enabled by calling set_auto_fill_mode(). If auto-fill mode is enabled we
 * use the following algorithm: - When calling <code>add_value(key,
 * value)</code>, we count the number of elements in the column corresponding
 * to <code>key</code>. Let's call this number $m$. - We also determine the
 * maximal number of elements in the other columns; call it $n$. - If $m <
 * n-1$ then we add $n-m-1$ copies of the object <code>T()</code> to this
 * column. Here, <code>T</code> is the data type of the given
 * <code>value</code>. For example, if <code>T</code> is a numeric type, then
 * <code>T()</code> is the number zero; if <code>T</code> is
 * <code>std::string</code>, then <code>T()</code> is the empty string
 * <code>""</code>. - Add the given value to this column.
 *
 * Padding the column with default elements makes sure that after the addition
 * the column has as many entries as the longest other column. In other words,
 * if we have skipped previous invokations of add_value() for a given key,
 * then the padding will enter default values into this column.
 *
 * The algorithm as described will fail if you try to skip adding values for a
 * key if adding an element for this key is the first thing you want to do for
 * a given iteration or time step, since we would then pad to the length of
 * the longest column of the <i>previous</i> iteration or time step. You may
 * have to re-order adding to this column to a different spot in your program,
 * after adding to a column that will always be added to; or, you may want to
 * start every iteration by adding the number of the iteration to the table,
 * for example in column 1.
 *
 * In the case above, we have always padded columns <b>above</b> the element
 * that is being added to a column. However, there is also a case where we
 * have to pad <b>below</b>. Namely, if a previous row has been completely
 * filled using TableHandler::add_value(), subsequent rows have been filled
 * partially, and we then ask for output via write_text() or write_tex(). In
 * that case, the last few rows that have been filled only partially need to
 * be padded below the last element that has been added to them. As before, we
 * do that by using default constructed objects of the same type as the last
 * element of that column.

class TableHandler
{
public:
  /**
   * Set of options how a table should be formatted when output with the
   * write_text() function. The following possibilities exist:
   *
   * - <code>table_with_headers</code>: The table is formatted in such a way
   * that the contents are aligned under the key of each column, i.e. the key
   * sits atop each column. This is suitable for tables with few columns where
   * the entire table can be displayed on the screen. Output looks like this:
   *   @code
   *     key1 key2 key3
   *     0    0    ""
   *     1    0    ""
   *     2    13   a
   *     1    0    ""
   *   @endcode
   * - <code>table_with_separate_column_description</code>: This is a better
   * format when there are many columns and the table as a whole can not be
   * displayed on the screen. Here, the column keys are first listed one-by-
   * one on lines of their own, and are numbered for better readability. In
   * addition, each of these description lines are prefixed by '#' to mark
   * these lines as comments for programs that want to read the following
   * table as data and should ignore these descriptive lines. GNUPLOT is one
   * such program that will automatically ignore lines so prefixed. Output
   * with this option looks like this:
   *   @code
   *     # 1: key1
   *     # 2: key2
   *     # 3: key3
   *     0 0  ""
   *     1 0  ""
   *     2 13 a
   *     1 0  ""
   *   @endcode
   * - <code>simple_table_with_separate_column_description</code>: This format
   * is very similar to <code>table_with_separate_column_description</code>,
   * but it skips aligning the columns with additional white space. This
   * increases the performance o fwrite_text() for large tables. Example
   * output:
   *   @code
   *     # 1: key1
   *     # 2: key2
   *     # 3: key3
   *     0 0 ""
   *     1 0 ""
   *     2 13 a
   *     1 0 ""
   *   @endcode
   * - <code>org_mode_table</code>: Outputs to org-mode (http://orgmode.org/)
   * table format. It is easy to convert org-mode tables to HTML/LaTeX/csv.
   * Example output:
   *   @code
   *   | key1 | key2 | key3 |
   *   | 0    | 0    | ""   |
   *   | 1    | 0    | ""   |
   *   | 2    | 13   | a    |
