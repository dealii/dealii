    /**
     * This class defines a model for the partitioning of a vector (or, in
     * fact, any linear data structure) among processors using MPI.
     *
     * The partitioner stores the global vector size and the locally owned
     * range as a half-open interval [@p lower, @p upper) on each process.
     * Furthermore, it includes a structure for the point-to-point communication
     * patterns. It allows the inclusion of ghost indices (i.e. indices that a
     * current processor needs to have access to, but are owned by another
     * process) through an IndexSet. In addition, it also stores the other
     * processors' ghost indices belonging to the current processor (see
     * import_targets()), which are the indices where other processors might
     * require information from. In a sense, these import indices form the dual
     * of the ghost indices. This information is gathered once when constructing
     * the partitioner, which obviates subsequent global communication steps
     * when exchanging data.
     *
     * The figure below gives an example of index space $[0,74)$ being split
     * into four parts that are each owned by one MPI process:
     * @image html partitioner.png
     * The first row (above the thick black line) shows which process owns which
     * elements. Below it, the next four lines indicate which elements of
     * the overall array each processor wants to know about -- this is
     * generally a superset of the locally owned elements, with the difference
     * being what are called "ghost elements".
     *
     * To understand the remaining pieces of the figure (and this class),
     * remember that in MPI, you can't just ask another process for data.
     * (That's not quite true: There are mechanisms in newer MPI standards
     * for this, but as a general rule it's true.) Rather, if you need
     * information, you need to send another process a message, the other
     * process needs to expect the message and respond as appropriate with
     * a message of its own. In practice, it is therefore easier and faster
     * if each process will *already* know what it will be asked and, at
     * the appropriate time, just send that data. The remaining lines of
     * information set up this kind of scheme.
     *
     * To this end, note that process 0 will want to know about five
     * elements it does not own itself: those with indices 20, 21 (owned
     * by process 1); and 40, 41, 43 (owned by process 2). Similar information
     * can be obtained from the following lines. To satisfy this need for
     * knowledge, it would therefore be quite useful if process 1 stored
     * that, at the appropriate time, it will have to send elements 20, 21
     * to process 0. Similarly, if you go through lines 2-4 below the thick
     * black line, you will see that process 0 should know that it will need
     * to send elements 1, 2, 13, 18, 19 to process 1; 18, 19 to process 2;
     * and elements 1, 2, 13 to process 3. These are called "import indices"
     * because other processes will want to import them. Instead of storing
     * these indices as a set, it is often useful to use half-open index
     * sets instead, and so the import indices listed above form the following
     * collection of sets: `[1,3)`, `[13,14)`, `[18,20)`, `[18,20)`,
     * `[1,3)`, `[13,14)`. This is how the import indices are shown
     * in the figure above. We now only have to know which of these
     * half-open sets are to be sent to whom. This is done in the line
     * above it where we list the "import targets" (i.e., the target
     * processes for an import operations): Process 1 will receive 5
     * elements (which are comprised of the first three half-open
     * target index sets), process 2 will receive 2 indices
     * (the fourth half-open interval), and process 3 will receive
     * 3 indices (the remaining two half-open intervals). This information
     * is encoded as the pairs `{1,5}`, `{2,2}`, `{3,3}` as the import
     * targets. Similar considerations can be made for what processes
     * 1, 2, and 3 will have to send out.
     *
     * Finally, when receiving information, it is useful to know how
     * many indices each process will receive from whom since then one
     * can already pre-allocate buffers of the right size. This is listed
     * in the last line under "ghost targets": Process 0 will receive
     * two elements from process 1 (namely those with indices 20, 21),
     * and three from process 2 (namely those with indices 40, 41, 43).
     * This is encoded as pairs `{1,2}` and `{2,3}`. Again, similar
     * considerations can be made for what processes 1, 2, and 3
     * should expect, and what is then shown in their respective columns.
     *
     * The main purpose of this class is to set up these data structures
     * knowing only which process owns which elements, and for which
     * additional ghost elements each process needs knowledge.
     *
     *
     * <h4>Local and global numbering</h4>
     *
     * The partitioner includes a mechanism for converting global to local and
     * local to global indices. Internally, this class stores vector elements
     * using the convention as follows: The local range is associated with
     * local indices [0, locally_owned_size()), and ghost indices are stored
     * consecutively in [locally_owned_size(), locally_owned_size() +
     * n_ghost_indices()). The ghost indices are sorted according to their
     * global index.
     *
     *
     * <h4>Parallel data exchange</h4>
     *
     * This class also handles the ghost data exchange for partitioned
     * arrays of objects -- i.e., if a separate class stores the
     * locally owned elements on each process, then this class
     * facilitates the importation of those elements that are locally
     * needed as ghosts but stored elsewhere. An example of where this class
     * is used is the LinearAlgebra::distributed::Vector class.
     *
     * The data exchange happens through four functions:
     * <ul>
     * <li> export_to_ghosted_array_start() is used for initiating an export
     * operation that sends data from the locally owned data field, passed as
     * an array, to the ghost data arrays of other processes (according to the
     * ghost indices stored in the present class).
     * This call starts non-blocking MPI send communication
     * routines, but does not wait for the routines to finish. Thus, the user
     * may not write into the respective positions of the underlying arrays as
     * the data might still be needed by MPI.
     * <li> export_to_ghosted_array_finish() finalizes the MPI data exchange
     * started in export_to_ghosted_array_start() and signals that the data in
     * the arrays may be used for further processing or modified as
     * appropriate.
     * <li> import_from_ghosted_array_start() is used for initiating an import
     * operation that sends data from a ghost data field, passed as an array,
     * to the locally owned array according to the ghost indices stored in the
     * present class. A VectorOperation::values flag can be passed to decide
     * on how to combine the data in the ghost field with the data at the
     * owner, since both relate to the same data entry. In assembly, this is
     * usually an add-to operation where contributions from all processes to
     * a locally owned element need to be added up. This call starts
     * non-blocking MPI communication routines, but does not wait for the
     * routines to finish. Thus, the user may not write into the respective
     * positions of the underlying arrays as the data might still be needed by
     * MPI.
     * <li> import_from_ghosted_array_finish() finalizes the MPI data exchange
     * started in import_from_ghosted_array_start() and signals that the data
     * in the arrays may be used for further processing or modified as
     * appropriate.
     * </ul>
     *
     * The MPI communication routines are point-to-point communication patterns.
     *
     *
     * <h4>Sending only selected ghost data</h4>
     *
     * This partitioner class operates on a fixed set of ghost indices and
     * must always be compatible with the ghost indices inside the array whose
     * partitioning it represents. In some cases,
     * one only wants to send around some of the ghost indices present in
     * a vector, but without creating a copy of the vector with a
     * suitable index set - think e.g. of local time stepping where different
     * regions of a vector might be exchanged at different stages of a time
     * step slice. This class supports that case by the following model: A
     * vector is first created with the full ghosted index set. Then, a second
     * Partitioner instance is created that sets ghost indices with a tighter
     * index set as ghosts, but specifying the larger index set as the second
     * argument to the set_ghost_indices() call. When data is exchanged, the
     * export_to_ghosted_array_start() and import_from_ghosted_array_start()
     * detect this case and only send the selected indices, taken from the
     * full array of ghost entries.
