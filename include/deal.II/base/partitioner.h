    /**
     * This class defines a model for the partitioning of a vector (or, in
     * fact, any linear data structure) among processors using MPI.
     *
     * The partitioner stores the global vector size and the locally owned
     * range as a half-open interval [@p lower, @p upper). Furthermore, it
     * includes a structure for the point-to-point communication patterns. It
     * allows the inclusion of ghost indices (i.e. indices that a current
     * processor needs to have access to, but are owned by another process)
     * through an IndexSet. In addition, it also stores the other processors'
     * ghost indices belonging to the current processor (see import_targets()),
     * which are the indices where other processors might require information from.
     * In a sense, these import indices form the dual of the ghost indices. This
     * information is gathered once when constructing the partitioner, which
     * obviates subsequent global communication steps when exchanging data.
     *
     * The figure below gives an example of index space $[0,74)$ being split into
     * four processes.
     * @image html partitioner.png
     * Here process 0 will import 5 DoFs from process 1 (first pair of import targets),
     * which corresponds to the first 3 elements of its import indices. Whereas
     * process 2 will import 3 DoFs from process 0, which corresponds to the first
     * two elements of its import indices.
     *
     * The partitioner includes a mechanism for converting global to local and
     * local to global indices. Internally, this class stores vector elements
     * using the convention as follows: The local range is associated with
     * local indices [0,@p local_size), and ghost indices are stored
     * consecutively in [@p local_size, @p local_size + @p n_ghost_indices).
     * The ghost indices are sorted according to their global index.
     *
     * <h4>Parallel data exchange</h4>
     *
     * This class handles the main ghost data exchange of
     * LinearAlgebra::distributed::Vector through four functions:
     * <ul>
     * <li> export_to_ghosted_array_start() is used for initiating an export
     * operation that sends data from the locally owned data field, passed as
     * an array, to a ghost data array according to the ghost indices stored
     * in the present class. This call starts non-blocking MPI communication
     * routines, but does not wait for the routines to finish. Thus, the user
     * may not write into the respective positions of the underlying arrays as
     * the data might still be needed by MPI.
     * <li> export_to_ghosted_array_finish() finalizes the MPI data exchange
     * started in export_to_ghosted_array_start() and signals that the data in
     * the arrays may be used for further processing or modified as
     * appropriate.
     * <li> import_from_ghosted_array_start() is used for initiating an import
     * operation that sends data from a ghost data field, passed as an array,
     * to the locally owned array according to the ghost indices stored in the
     * present class. A VectorOperation::values flag can be passed to decide
     * on how to combine the data in the ghost field with the data at the
     * owner, since both relate to the same data entry. In assembly, this is
     * usually and add-into operation. This call starts non-blocking MPI
     * communication routines, but does not wait for the routines to
     * finish. Thus, the user may not write into the respective positions of
     * the underlying arrays as the data might still be needed by MPI.
     * <li> import_from_ghosted_array_finish() finalizes the MPI data exchange
     * started in import_from_ghosted_array_start() and signals that the data
     * in the arrays may be used for further processing or modified as
     * appropriate.
     * </ul>
     *
     * The MPI communication routines are point-to-point communication patterns.
     *
     * <h4>Sending only selected ghost data</h4>
     *
     * This partitioner class operates on a fixed set of ghost indices and
     * must always be compatible with the ghost indices inside a vector. In
     * some cases, one only wants to send some of the ghost indices present in
     * a vector around, but without creating a copy of the vector with a
     * suitable index set - think e.g. of local time stepping where different
     * regions of a vector might be exchanged at different stages of a time
     * step slice. This class supports that case by the following model: A
     * vector is first created with the full ghosted index set. Then, a second
     * Partitioner instance is created that sets ghost indices with a tighter
     * index set as ghosts, but specifying the larger index set as the second
     * argument to the set_ghost_indices() call. When data is exchanged, the
     * export_to_ghosted_array_start() and import_from_ghosted_array_start()
     * detect this case and only send the selected indices, taken from the
     * full array of ghost entries.
     *
