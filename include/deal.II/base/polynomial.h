   * Rachowicz, and Hardy (CMAME 77 (1989) 79-112, Sec. 4). The first two
   * polynomials are the standard linear shape functions given by $\phi_{0}(x)

   * (2x-1)\phi_{l-1} + \phi_{2}, l=4,6,8,...$.
   *
   * The degrees of freedom are the values at the vertices and the derivatives
   * at the midpoint. Currently, we do not scale the polynomials in any way,
   * although better conditioning of the element stiffness matrix could
   * possibly be achieved with scaling.
   *
   * Calling the constructor with a given index <tt>p</tt> will generate the
   * following: if <tt>p==0</tt>, then the resulting polynomial is the linear
   * function associated with the left vertex, if <tt>p==1</tt> the one

   * In analogy to the proper Hermite polynomials, this basis evaluates the

   * derivative at $x=1$. Likewise, the last polynomial $p_n$ evaluates to 1
   * at $x=1$ with a zero value and zero derivative at $x=0$. The second
   * polynomial $p_1$ and the second to last polynomial $p_{n-1}$ represent
   * the derivative degree of freedom at $x=0$ and $x=1$, respectively.
   * They are zero at both the end points $x=0, x=1$ and have zero
   * derivative at the opposite end, $p_1'(1)=0$ and $p_{n-1}'(0)=0$. As
   * opposed to the original Hermite polynomials, $p_0$ does not have zero
   * derivative at $x=0$. The additional degree of freedom is used to make
   * $p_0$ and $p_1$ orthogonal, which for $n=3$ results in a root at
   * $x=\frac{2}{7}$ for $p_0$ and at $x=\frac{5}{7}$ for $p_n$,
   * respectively. Furthermore, the extension of these polynomials to higher
   * degrees $n>3$ is constructed by adding additional nodes inside the unit
   * interval, again ensuring better conditioning. The nodes are computed as
   * the roots of the Jacobi polynomials for $\alpha=\beta=4$, which are
   * orthogonal against the square of the generating function $x^2(1-x)^2$
   * with the Hermite
   * property. Then, these polynomials are constructed in the usual way as
   * Lagrange polynomials with double roots at $x=0$ and $x=1$. For example
   * with $n=4$, all of $p_0, p_1, p_3, p_4$ get an additional root at $x=0.5$
   * through the factor $(x-0.5)$. In summary, this basis is dominated by
   * nodal contributions, but it is not a nodal one because the second and
   * second to last polynomials that are non-nodal, and due to the presence of
   * double nodes in $x=0$ and $x=1$. The weights of the basis functions are
   * set such that the sum of all polynomials with unit weight represents the
   * constant function 1, similarly to Lagrange polynomials.
   *
   * The basis only contains Hermite information for <code>degree>=3</code>,
   * but it is also implemented for degrees between 0 and two. For the linear
   * case, the usual hat functions are implemented, whereas the polynomials
   * for <code>degree=2</code> are $p_0(x)=(1-x)^2$, $p_1(x)=2x(x-1)$, and
   * $p_2(x)=x^2$, in accordance with the construction principle for degree 3.
   *
   * These two relaxations improve the condition number of the mass matrix
   * (i.e., interpolation) significantly, as can be seen from the following
   * table:
