       * @param[in] max_num_threads The maximal number of threads this MPI
       * process should utilize. If this argument is set to
       * numbers::invalid_unsigned_int (the default value), then the number of
       * threads is determined automatically in the following way: the number
       * of threads to run on this MPI process is set in such a way that all
       * of the cores in your node are spoken for. In other words, if you have
       * started one MPI process per node, setting this argument is equivalent
       * to setting it to the number of cores present in the node this MPI
       * process runs on. If you have started as many MPI processes per node
       * as there are cores on each node, then this is equivalent to passing 1
       * as the argument. On the other hand, if, for example, you start 4 MPI
       * processes on each 16-core node, then this option will start 4 worker
       * threads for each node. If you start 3 processes on an 8 core node,
       * then they will start 3, 3 and 2 threads, respectively.
       *
       * @note This function calls MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit() with
       * either @p max_num_threads or, following the discussion above, a
       * number of threads equal to the number of cores allocated to this MPI
       * process. However, MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit() in turn also
       * evaluates the environment variable DEAL_II_NUM_THREADS. Finally, the
       * worker threads can only be created on cores to which the current MPI
       * process has access to; some MPI implementations limit the number of
       * cores each process has access to to one or a subset of cores in order
       * to ensure better cache behavior. Consequently, the number of threads
       * that will really be created will be the minimum of the argument
       * passed here, the environment variable (if set), and the number of
       * cores accessible to the thread.
       *
       * @note MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit() can only work if it is
       * called before any threads are created. The safest place for a call to
       * it is therefore at the beginning of <code>main()</code>.
       * Consequently, this extends to the current class: the best place to
