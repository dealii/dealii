      /**
       * A base class for algorithms that implement the task of coming up with
       * communication patterns to retrieve data from other processes in a
       * dynamic-sparse way. In computer science, this is often called a
       * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_algorithm">consensus
       * problem</a>.
       *
       * The problem consensus algorithms are trying to solve is this: Let's
       * say you have $P$ processes that work together via MPI. Each (or at
       * least some) of these want to send information to some of the other
       * processes, or request information from other processes. No process
       * knows which other process wants to communicate with them. The challenge
       * is to determine who needs to talk to whom and what information needs to
       * be sent, and to come up with an algorithm that ensures that this
       * communication happens.
       *
       * That this is not a trivial problem can be seen by an analogy of the
       * postal service. There, some senders may request information from some
       * other participants in the postal service. So they send a letter that
       * requests the information, but the recipients do not know how many such
       * letters they need to expect (or that they should expect any at all).
       * They also do not know how long they need to keep checking their mailbox
       * for incoming requests. The recipients can be considered reliable,
       * however: We can assume that everyone who is sent a request puts a
       * letter with the answer in the mail. This time at least the recipients
       * of these answers know that they are waiting for these answers because
       * they have previously sent a request. They do not know in advance,
       * however, when the answer will arrive and how long to wait. The goal of
       * a consensus algorithm is then to come up with a strategy in which every
       * participant can say who they want to send requests to, what that
       * request is, and is then guaranteed an answer. The algorithm will only
       * return when all requests by all participants have been answered and the
       * answer delivered to the requesters.
       *
       * The problem is generally posed in terms of *requests* and *answers*.
       * In practice, either of these two may be empty messages. For example,
       * processes may simply want to send information to others that they know
       * these others need; in this case, the "answer" message may be empty
       * and its meaning is simply an affirmation that the information was
       * received. Similarly, in some cases processes simply need to inform
       * others that they want information, but the destination process knows
       * what information is being requested (based on where in the program
       * the request happens) and can send that information without there be
       * any identifying information in the request; in that case, the
       * request message may be empty and simply serve to identify the
       * requester. (Each message can be queried for its sender.)
       *
       * As mentioned in the first paragraph, the algorithms we are interested
       * in are "dynamic-sparse":
       * - Dynamic: By the time the algorithm is called, the other processes do
       *   not know yet that they have to answer requests.
       * - Sparse: Each process only has to communicate with a small subset of
       *   processes of the MPI communicator.
       *
       * In order to run the communication algorithms, users of this class have
       * to provide a number of pieces of information:
       * - An MPI communicator.
       * - On each process, a list of ranks of processes to communicate with.
       * - Functionality to pack/unpack data to send as either the original
       *   request or as part of the answer.
       * This information is encoded through the `virtual` functions of classes
       * derived from ConsensusAlgorithm::Process, and the constructor of the
       * current class receives an object of a type derived from that class as
       * an argument.
       *
       * This base class only introduces a basic interface to achieve
       * these goals, while derived classes implement different algorithms
       * to actually compute such communication patterns and perform the
       * communication.
       *
       * @tparam T1 The type of the elements of the vector to be sent.
       * @tparam T2 The type of the elements of the vector to be received.
