    /**
     * A namespace for algorithms that implement the task of communicating
     * in a dynamic-sparse way. In computer science, this is often called a
     * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_algorithm">consensus
     * problem</a>.
     *
     * The problem consensus algorithms are trying to solve is this: Let's
     * say you have $P$ processes that work together via MPI. Each (or at
     * least some) of these want to send information to some of the other
     * processes, or request information from other processes. No process
     * knows which other process wants to communicate with them. The challenge
     * is to determine who needs to talk to whom and what information needs to
     * be sent, and to come up with an algorithm that ensures that this
     * communication happens.
     *
     * That this is not a trivial problem can be seen by an analogy of the
     * postal service. There, some senders may request information from some
     * other participants in the postal service. So they send a letter that
     * requests the information, but the recipients do not know how many such
     * letters they need to expect (or that they should expect any at all).
     * They also do not know how long they need to keep checking their mailbox
     * for incoming requests. The recipients can be considered reliable,
     * however: We can assume that everyone who is sent a request puts a
     * letter with the answer in the mail. This time at least the recipients
     * of these answers know that they are waiting for these answers because
     * they have previously sent a request. They do not know in advance,
     * however, when the answer will arrive and how long to wait. The goal of
     * a consensus algorithm is then to come up with a strategy in which every
     * participant can say who they want to send requests to, what that
     * request is, and is then guaranteed an answer. The algorithm will only
     * return when all requests by all participants have been answered and the
     * answer delivered to the requesters.
     *
     * The problem is generally posed in terms of *requests* and *answers*.
     * In practice, either of these two may be empty messages. For example,
     * processes may simply want to send information to others that they know
     * these others need; in this case, the "answer" message may be empty
     * and its meaning is simply an affirmation that the information was
     * received. Similarly, in some cases processes simply need to inform
     * others that they want information, but the destination process knows
     * what information is being requested (based on where in the program
     * the request happens) and can send that information without there be
     * any identifying information in the request; in that case, the
     * request message may be empty and simply serve to identify the
     * requester. (Each message can be queried for its sender.)
     *
     * As mentioned in the first paragraph, the algorithms we are interested
     * in are "dynamic-sparse":
     * - Dynamic: By the time the algorithm is called, the other processes do
     *   not know yet that they have to answer requests.
     * - Sparse: Each process only has to communicate with a small subset of
     *   processes of the MPI communicator.
     *
     * In order to run the communication algorithms, users of this class have
     * to provide a number of pieces of information:
     * - An MPI communicator.
     * - On each process, a list of ranks of processes to communicate with.
     * - Functionality to pack/unpack data to send as either the original
     *   request or as part of the answer.
     * This information is typically either provided as direct objects (for
     * the first two of the points above), or as function objects (for the
     * third point above). In the latter case, the function objects are often
     * simply lambda functions declared right in the context where one wants
     * to run a consensus algorithm; these lambda functions may then reference
     * variables that are active at the point of declaration of the lambda
     * function, such as variables local to the surrounding function.
     *
     *
     * <h3>Available implementations</h3>
     *
     * There are many ways to implement the general functionality required
     * for these "consensus algorithms". This namespace provides several
     * implementations of consensus algorithms, specifically the
     * NBX and PEX algorithms, along with a serial one for the case where
     * one wants to run such an algorithm on a single process. The key
     * entry points to these algorithms are the
     * nbx(), pex(), serial(), and selector() functions that take a
     * communicator, a list of targets, and a number of functions
     * as argument. The selector() function redirects to the other
     * implementations based on the number of processes that participate
     * in an MPI universe, since some implementations are better or worse
     * suited for large or small parallel computations.
     *
     * This namespace also implements specializations of each of the
     * functions for the specific case where a calling process is not
     * actually interested in receiving and processing answers -- that
     * is, the goal is simply to *send* messages to a number of targets,
     * but no answer is required; all we want to know is that by the end of
     * the call, all targets have been sent their respective data. This,
     * strictly speaking, does not fall under the umbrella of "consensus
     * algorithms", but is really just a "some-to-some" communication.
     * (This operation is also provided by the Utilities::MPI::some_to_some()
     * function, though with a different interface.) For this special
     * case, the functions in this namespace only need to receive
     * an MPI communicator, a list of targets, and function objects that
     * encode and decode the messages to be sent, but no functions for
     * encoding a reply, or processing a reply.
