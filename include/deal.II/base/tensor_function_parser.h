/**
 * This class implements a tensor function object that gets its value by parsing
 * a string describing this function. It is a wrapper class for the muparser
 * library (see http://muparser.beltoforion.de/). This class is essentially an
 * extension of the FunctionParser class to read in a TensorFunction. The class
 * reads in an expression of length dim<sup>rank</sup> (separated by a
 * semicolon) where the components of the tensor function are filled according
 * to the C++ convention (fastest index is the most right one).
 *
 * @note In contrast to the FunctionParser class the TensorFunctionParser class does not support
 * 	 automatic differentiation.
 *
 * A minimal example for the usage of the class would be:
 * @code
 * // set up time dependent tensor function:
 * const std::string variables = "x,y,t";
 * const std::string expression =
 *       "exp(-t)*cos(x+y);-sin(pi*x*y-t);sin(pi*x*y-t);exp(t)*cos(x+y)";
 * std::map<std::string,double> constants;
 * constants["pi"] = numbers::PI;
 *
 * // TensorFunctionParser with 2+1 variables (space + time) in 2d of rank 2.
 * // It is necessary to tell the parser that there is an additional variable
 * // to be taken into account (t).
 * TensorFunctionParser<2,2> tfp;
 * tfp.initialize(variables,
 *               expression,
 *               constants,
 *               true); // flag for time dependence
 *
 * // Point at which we want to evaluate the function
 * Point<2> point(0.0, 1.0);
 *
 * // evaluate the expression at 'point':
 * double result = tfp.value(point);
 *
 * deallog << "Function '" << expression << "'"
 *         << " @ " << point
 *         << " is: "
 *         << std::endl
 *         << result[0][0] << ' ' << result[0][1] << std::endl
 *         << result[1][0] << ' ' << result[1][1]
 *         << std::endl;
 * @endcode
 *
 * See also the documentation of the FunctionParser class.
 *
 * This class overloads the virtual method value() and value_list() of the
 * TensorFunction base class with the byte compiled versions of the expressions
 * given to the initialize() methods. Note that the class will not work unless
 * you first call the initialize() method that accepts the text description of
 * the function as an argument (among other things).
 *
 * The syntax to describe a function follows usual programming practice, and
 * is explained in detail at the homepage of the underlying muparser library
 * at http://muparser.beltoforion.de/ .
 *
 *
 * Vector-valued functions can either be declared using strings where the
 * function components are separated by semicolons, or using a vector of
 * strings each defining one vector component.
 *
 *
 * @ingroup functions

   * <code>time_dependent</code> parameter to true.  An exception is thrown if
   * the number of variables specified here is different from dim (if this
   * function is not time-dependent) or from dim+1 (if it is time-dependent).
   *
   * @param[in] expressions A vector of strings containing the expressions that
   * will be byte compiled by the internal parser (TensorFunctionParser). Note
   * that the size of this vector must match exactly the number of components of
   * the TensorFunctionParser, as declared in the constructor. If this is not
   * the case, an exception is thrown.
   *
   * @param[in] constants A map of constants used to pass any necessary constant
   * that we want to specify in our expressions (in the example above the
   * number pi). An expression is valid if and only if it contains only
   * defined variables and defined constants (other than the functions
   * specified above). If a constant is given whose name is not valid (eg:
   * <code>constants["sin"] = 1.5;</code>) an exception is thrown.
   *
   * @param[in] time_dependent If this is a time dependent function, then the
   * last variable declared in <b>vars</b> is assumed to be the time variable,
   * and this->get_time() is used to initialize it when evaluating the
   * function. Naturally the number of variables parsed by the initialize()
   * method in this case is dim+1. The value of this parameter defaults to
   * false, i.e. do not consider time.
